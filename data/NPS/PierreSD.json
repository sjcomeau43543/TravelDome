  "\nThe rugged beauty of the Badlands draws visitors from around the world. These striking geologic deposits contain one of the world\u2019s richest fossil beds. Ancient mammals such as the rhino, horse, and saber-toothed cat once roamed here. The park\u2019s 244,000 acres protect an expanse of mixed-grass prairie where bison, bighorn sheep, prairie dogs, and black-footed ferrets live today.\n"

This resource is truly a jewel in the National Park Service.\n"

  "\nDuring the Cold War, a vast arsenal of nuclear missiles were placed in the Great Plains. Hidden in plain sight, for thirty years 1,000 missiles were kept on constant alert; hundreds remain today. The Minuteman Missile remains an iconic weapon in the American nuclear arsenal. It holds the power to destroy civilization, but is meant as a nuclear deterrent to maintain peace and prevent war.\n"

Below the remnant island of intact prairie sits Wind Cave, one of the longest and most complex caves in the world. Named for barometric winds at its entrance, this maze of passages is home to boxwork, a unique formation rarely found elsewhere.\n"
