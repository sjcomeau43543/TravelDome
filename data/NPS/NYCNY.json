  "\nWomen\u2019s Rights National Historical Park tells the story of the first Women\u2019s Rights Convention held in Seneca Falls, NY on July 19-20,1848.  It is a story of struggles for civil rights, human rights, and equality, global struggles that continue today.  The efforts of women\u2019s rights leaders, abolitionists, and other 19th century reformers remind us that all people must be accepted as equals.\n"
