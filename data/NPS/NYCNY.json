Raised in a townhouse at 28 E. 20th St., Theodore Roosevelt would grow up to be our 26th President and become immortalized on Mount Rushmore. However, he started life as a sickly yet bright boy who exercised to improve his health and began a lifelong passion for the \"strenuous life.\"\n"

  "\nAs president, Theodore Roosevelt created protections for ordinary citizens, began regulation of big business, and made the US a major force in international affairs. Yet one of the most important presidencies in America's history nearly didn't happen. See the place where a brief, emotional, and improvised ceremony in Buffalo, NY brought TR into office, and forever altered the nation.\n"

His landscape paintings launched the art movement known as the Hudson River School.\nHis groundbreaking achievements took place here in Catskill, New York -- in the \"peaceful shades\" of his beloved home, Cedar Grove.\n"
