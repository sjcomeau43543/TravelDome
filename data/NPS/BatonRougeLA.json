  "\nOur country\u2019s landscape is rich and mysterious.  It is filled with twisting bayous, rivers and America\u2019s largest river swamp.  We have fields of sugar cane and cotton, ancient live oaks and towering cypress.  Alligators, raccoons, and even bears roam our lands while 270 species of birds take to our skies.  From our waters come catfish, shrimp, oysters and the crawfish that make us so well known.\n"
