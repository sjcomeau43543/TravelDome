His early life on Kentucky's frontier shaped his character and prepared him to lead the nation through Civil War.  The country's first memorial to Lincoln, built with donations from young and old, enshrines the symbolic birthplace cabin.\n"

The Union victory at Fort Donelson elated the North, and stunned the South. Within days of the surrender, Clarksville and Nashville would fall into Union hands.
