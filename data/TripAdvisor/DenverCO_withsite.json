  "My whole family, and all of our friends love the Denver Botanic Gardens. They always have a great program to offer, and the Chihuly exhibit was one of the most amazing things we've ever experienced.",
  "We visited the York street location and it just happened to be free day...who doesn't like free so that was a bonus..check the website for any additional upcoming free days. This place is pretty big and open with lots to see and do,they also hold summer concerts here so definitely check the events calendar prior to arriving; the gardens close early for those events. The boys loved looking at the various topiary throughout the grounds. Our favorite spots were the Mordecai Children's Garden, the boys had a blast playing observation and discovery while my husband and i enjoyed the Japanese Garden and authentic Tea House. We will definitely return for another visit with more time to spend enjoy and embrace.",
  "I have been a member of the gardens  for many years ,since 1979 when I moved to Colorado.   It has been wonderful to watch it grow and develop into  a true jewel of Denver.  It has many garden themes and areas from herbal ,shade gardens,  to  an alpine rock garden, Japanese garden with Bonsai and a beautiful tea house,  water garden with lovely lily pads,  rose garden,  and  xeriscapic area.  This term was coined from the DBG staff years ago, and it does not mean a pile of rocks .  \n It is  gardening with drought tolerant plants  that can survive Denver's mile high altitude climate changes and the semiarid climate.  The gardens are given  meticulous care.  There is also a children's garden that has fun exploration geared to the youth.  \nI enjoy my membership as I can drop in, if I am in the area and take a nice 30-45' walk based on my time frame.   I have been to several botanical gardens around the country, and still say my DGB is one of the best and most diverse!\nHope you think so too.",
  "Walking thru the gardens is not just about plants--there are sculptures, seating areas to reflect and much more. Gaze at the fish and stand under a tall tree--all nice escapes for the day .",
  "Because of the pandemic all the indoor displays were closed. \nOutdoors was pretty dead and desolate nothing really was in bloom - no bonsai on display. Nice layout and spread but really nothing much to enjoy maybe because of the weather and the current global event.",
  "We went to the botanic gardens for their winter Christmas display - it was breath taking and a wonderful experience for the entire family - HIGHLY recommended.",
  "Early March is possibly not thought of as the best time to visit a Botanic Gardens, however we really enjoyed our visit to the gardens. Spring flowers are blooming and the trees are budding. The Japanese Gardens were looking beautiful. \nWe visited the science building and had an excellent one to one talk on microscopic hairs on plants. Absolutely fascinating. \nAs always, there were beautiful blooming orchids in the hot houses. ",
  "Staff was friendly and view spectacular. A must-see in Denver even if you don\u2019t have a green thumb. The science pyramid is informative and the gardens enchanting. "

  "The view was great. We did not go up to the summit but still could see for miles around. The drive was frightening because it was a very long drop and there where no guards rails",
  "I think I've said it all in the title. Getting there from Denver area is a scenic drive in itself. The grove is amazing. Goats can be seen. It is awesome.",
  "When you get to the top you feel like your on top of the world - you won't be disappointed!!!!  The drive up to the top is incrediately.",
  "Definitely worth traveling in your own car. But be careful when planning your trip because: (1) the road may be closed because of snow even in the middle of summer and (2) the road is narrow and may be icy. We did not have any problems with the high altitude, but I heard that some people did. There is a short but a bit challenging walk from the parking lot to the summit, so take good shoes. And of course, have warm clothes because it is really high and the temperature may be quite low.",
  "Somewhat daunting drive up to the peak. High elevation is noticeable and the harshness of the wind,temperature, and terrain is memorable"

  "We love visiting Union Station! They did such a wonderful job remodeling the old station. The restaurants are wonderful, from drinks at the Terminal Bar, speciality pancakes at Snooze, oysters at Stoic and Genuine to the speakeasy feel of Cooper Lounge upstairs (don\u2019t miss it). Kids enjoy running through the fountains in the summer and grabbing ice cream. And if you\u2019re waiting to get into a restaurant, cruise through Tattered Cover for a quick read. ",
  "Union Station has become, as others have said, the living room of Denver - a place where all can gather in the main room to have coffee, a beer, a snack, and be part of a community of downtown workers, tourists, and local residents.  As the Denver transportation hub, it is where the airport meets Amtrak meets RTD buses and light rail and a place where you can enjoyably linger while waiting for transportation to the mountain ski resorts.  Yes, you can fly to Denver and never rent a car to go skiing - the Ski Train departs Union Station once again for Winterpark on the weekends in 2017, and buses and shuttles also depart here.  In addition, you have a wonderful hotel, great restaurants in the station, and other great restaurants just a block or two away.  Coors Field is just a 5 minute walk.",
  "The restored Union Station which includes the magnificent Crawford Hotel is a must see, and if looking for a place to stay The Crawford is beautiful, comfortable and a great value.\n",
  "Bring back the good old days. Nice areas, clean, to sit and people watch or grab a meal. Center of Denver and good starting point. Read the signs hanging inside for some interesting history. ",
  "This is a cool spot and while it is still a train station they have turned parts of it into food stations and cute stores. Worth a walk through! ",
  "Having worked in downtown Denver for 30 years, I remember when Union Station was a rundown, seedy stop for Amtrak and little else.  Now it's a booming visitor center filled with restaurants, shops, a hotel and lots of happy ids running through the fountains during the summer.  You can still catch a train or a bus, but you'll enjoy the experience so much more now.",
  "As soon as we learned how to use the rail system we used it! Talk about easy. If you still do not know the security was fabulous to us & helped us. Even told us where to eat.",
  "Everyone told us we had to come check this out. I honestly don't get all the praise and clamoring over it. Now granted we were between meals, and weren't into having a drink at 10:00 am, so while it was pretty, I'm not sure all the hype, unless you need to catch a train. \nIt's pretty busy with a lot of people getting food and waiting for trains. Looks nice and restored."

  "We love a good ball game and follow our Blue Jays! Can\u2019t say enough about the staff at the field- so friendly and warm!!! Made us feel very special. So many meal options and just a very pretty park. I highly recommend seeing a game here! Club seats were cheap and again the staff was second to none. Highlight of our Denver trip!",
  "Easy access and exit, beautiful stadium, friendly helpful vendors and staff, plenty of restaurants, and the loudest cheer of the day was for a  Navy Serviceman being honored that day. What's not to like?",
  "Went to the Rockies game with 10 of our family and truly enjoyed the BEAUTIFUL Sunset, excellent food choices, manicured field and the game was great!  Loved all about the evening!",
  "We have been to the field several times.  It is fun for the entire family.  Baseball at its finest.  Plenty of food venues and restrooms.",
  "We took the family ro see a Rockies game and it was fantastic! The stadium is very convenient to get to with great views and plenty of delicious restaurants to check out!",
  "Excellent location in the heart of downtown Denver. You can drive, take the train, or ride the bus up the 16th street mall. The air is electric and the crowds are friendly. The food is a cut above other stadiums I have had the luck to see. You can watch from your seat or from one of several bars located throughout the stadium. Be sure to head there early as it is a popular venue for Denver fans. Follow the crowds toward one of the best experiences you can imagine. They also have a store for any fan who forgot to wear his/her purple. It's safe and fun. If you don't have a lot of cash you can buy rock pile tickets for a reasonable price.",
  "Affordable professional sports option for families.  Great memories and sunsets.  Variety of food offered.",
  "Our tour guide was so cute and adorable. You can tell she has a real interest in passion in her job, and it just shines through in her story telling. Her name slips my mind, but I remember she had been there since the park opened 26 years ago. We saw many aspects of the park and learned some history of it, and the surounding areas. Fun fact, Blue Moon beer originated here under a different name, but the building is still there. I love this ball park and always have, but seeing it in person is really what you need to do. I definitely want to return to catch a game here someday."

  "This was a great drive up the mountains. But be prepared for cool weather (it was 90 degrees at the bottom and 52 degrees when we reached the top). And be forewarned that the drive is not for the faint of heart. There are narrow places with no guard rails and many sharp turns. If you or your passengers are squeamish about narrow, twisty roads with drop offs - you might want to pass on this drive. The drive through Rocky Mt National Park is not QUITE as challenging. Note that we did not drive up Pikes Peak since some online reviews said it was similar to Mt Evans but more touristy - we liked the less touristy option but there are no services other than basic restrooms at the top.\n\nI'd suggest driving up one side - from Evergreen and then down the other side. I preferred starting from the I-70 westbound exit for the Evergreen Parkway (#252) then turn onto Squaw Pass Road and follow that all the way up to the entrance to the National Forest Service Road (Mt Evans Road). Then, on your way back down, take the left from the end of the Mt Evans Road, following the other end of Squawpass Rd, past Echo Lake, down to Idaho Springs. Here you could have a nice dinner in a quaint town (if you time it right) and reconnect to I-70. The trip down from the mountain this way was a little easier drive and so, when everyone was tired (including the driver) it was better to go down the easier way. I would allow for 2.25 hours up and 1.5 hours down if you go this way - plus however much time you spend at the top or any of the turn outs and stops along the way (Summit Lake is worth a stop).",
  "A thrill drive for  an hour  from Idaho springs base with gorgeous and striking views of nature, Ponder point , Echo lake , Summit lake , Mt. Goliath Natural Area . Echo lake souvenir shop /lodge are  great spots along the  route - some are in 10 mile  before the 14 mile road. Animals - Mountain goats , ] Brown-capped rosy finches , yellow-bellied marmot  and mule deer - are visible en route.  \n14 miles  road has Entrance Fees is 15/- and clouds do cover the curvy road. \nInitial 10 miles   has some good spots  too  as \n\n At summit  it is cold  , better to have   layer in summer . stacks of  bristlecone pines and  wildflowers  following water reservoirs , flat land and rocky mountains .. Awesome Road trip.",
  "We had a beautiful drive to the top, IMHO better than Pikes Peak! Less crowded and more accessible (this due to construction at PP). Saw many mountain goats, elk and bighorn sheep.",
  "This was so beautiful!!!!  We went for a Saturday ride and it had just snowed. That is what we moved here for. My daughter had flown in to visit so she really enjoyed the ride.",
  "Echo Lake, Summit Lake, and the summit of Mt Evans are the places that you can easily reach with your car and have an experience of high mountains.",
  "We drove this scenic byway hoping to drive to Mt. Evans but only made it to Echo Lake as the road to the peak was already closed in October. However we drove all the way to Evergreen and it was a great drive on a nice road with colorful aspen leaves to look at. Juniper Pass was a great stop along the way.",
  "We drive the Mt. Evans Scenic Byway (Highway 5) at least once every summer.   Via I-70 from downtown Denver to Idaho Springs exit 240 is about 32.5 miles, to Highway 103.  Highway 5 is about 13 miles of Chicago Creek, past Chicago Forks and just beyond picuresque Echo Lake 10,600'.  Denver Botanic Gardens Mount Goliath Dos Chappell Nature Center,  +3 miles) at about 11,500' is advised; with hikes among wildflowers and bristlecone pines.  Continuing UP Highway 5, views open to all directions, wildflowers line the road, and critters appear (marmots, pika, bighorns, mountain goats, and birds)  Sharp dropoffs beside the road are common, hence the warning about  acrophobia/a\ngoraphobia.  Six miles to Summit Lake, 13,000' is stunning, with views up, down, sideways; parking is often crowded.  Great views of the lake with Mt. Evans behind.  Many, many alpine wildflowers through July into August.  Occasionally wildlife near the lake.  The final 5+ miles to \"summit parking\" at 14,130 abounds with switchbacks, pulloffs, sights, and often animals.  Pika are elusive, marmots like to eat and sun, bighorns wander, and mountain goat are often along this section and/or at the top.  Views from Longs Peak to Pikes Peak north and south, to the Collegiate Peaks west, and Denver and the Great Plains east.  A short gravel walk/crawl to the peak at 14,250 is available.  Water, sunscreen, snacks/food as this is a half to full day venture (120 miles round trip minimum) from downtown Denver.  Bring layers of clothing.",
  "Did this attraction on the last day of a 2 week trip around the Colorado rockies . A lovely drive , hairy at times, and often takes much longer than planned due to travelling at the slowest speed of the car in front. We were lucky the road had only recently reopened after a late snowfall in June.  But worth the travel right up to 14000 , as we were able to see all the mountains we had explored during the trip ."

  "First time I\u2019d visited and thought I should probably get there early. Man, I\u2019m glad I did.  I got there at 9:30 and didn\u2019t leave until 5:00 and felt like I rushed through a lot of exhibits. Though I had no kids with me, this is a wonderful place for children and I saw a ton of them there actively engaged.  There are more docents working there, that actively engage children and adults in conversation and demonstrations, than I have ever seen in any museum I\u2019ve been too.  They have exhibits on Ancient Egypt, gems and minerals, dioramas of wildlife (that were amazing) from all parts of the world, an outer space exhibit that\u2019s very hands on (even has a virtual experience ride), planetarium with about 6 movies to choose from, an IMAX 3D theatre, dinosaurs exhibit with people working on 175 million year old fossils that stop and talk to you and answer questions, a truly terrific exhibit on the Dead Sea Scrolls (temporary), a restaurant that I thought was quite good with a nice variety of items, and a whole bunch more.  Denver is very lucky to have this gem of a museum!  I\u2019d love to go back and highly recommend it!",
  "DMNS is an evolving experience, which should be a required part of the educational experience of every Denverite. Situated next to the Marvelous Denver Zoo and nestled within the nearly mile square Denver City Park, this facility is in a constant state of growth and reinvention. \n\nSince I was less than five years old and visited here as a tourist more than six decades ago, this has been a place of wonder and fascination for me. When I would think about our next visit to Colorado, what was then the Denver Natural History Museum would be foremost in my dreams and fantasy. And, today, I have to admit, it is even better than it was when I was a child. It is a place for all ages and interests, featuring outstanding and compelling fixed exhibits, as well as rotating special, traveling  exhibits, which are always sure to leave one with a sense of wonder and awe about the real nature of our world and universe. Take in a movie, which will place you in the center of the action in the astounding IMAX theater, or visit the planetarium, where special summer events have even featured music and light shows, or take the kids into some of the multiple hands-on exhibits. Want to see kids getting excited in science and education?  This is the place. \n\nThe DMNS is endowed by a diversity personal, governmental and business donation and grants, as well as a membership exceeding 50,000 individuals. I'm proud to list myself among them.\nTake a date and do an event here, or take the family and spend the day here. Send your kids to summer day camp here. And, visit the amazing gift shop, where you can purchase actual worthwhile gifts and educational item for kids of all ages. Then visit the T-Rex Cafe, where you choose from a wide selection of generally healthy and nutritious meals, pizza and pasta to mexcan, and you can even order a bison burger! My favorite is the truly exceptional salad bar. Prices are reasonable in both the gift shop and the T-REX Cafe. Have a great meal and support this astounding place at the same time.\nThis is a place to which you will be compelled to return, so buy a membership online, or at the facility. Check out the membership benefits, and you quickly agree that this is an investment, as well as one of the best values your money will ever buy.\n\nSupport this gem with your money, your patronage, or your time as a volunteer. You will discover that this is not simply a dusty old museum; it is entertainment, it is education, and it is an ever changing experience you will never forget, and will want to repeat often with your friends and family.",
  "The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a perfect place to take the kids - for adults also, informative, hands-on exhibits, special exhibits, special interest areas - also have an IMAX theater with several different movies, a planetarium, lots of taxidermy and dinosaurs - lots of walking but great way to spend a few hours to take in all of the different options (recommend about 1/2 day visits)",
  "It's a must see exhibit of course, but it was VERY poorly planned out.  The timed tickets are aimed to limit the amount of people in the exhibit at one time, but people just linger and don't leave.  There is way to much stuff to read.  More audio would help.  We had the 11:10 spot on a Sunday and it took us two hours to walk the whole area, but still only get to see a few of the actual scrolls.  The scrolls are in a circular container and people don't let you into the line because it has no start and no finish.  It was very chaotic. The curators would tell people to go to other areas first, but then you really couldn't get back to the ones you missed and the lines just got worse as the day progressed and they let more people in.  Do yourself a favor and go during the work week if you are able (not the weekend) and buy tickets for the very first slot!  Get there early since you enter as a group, but still in line.  If you have children under age 10, get them a baby sitter.  The young ones just weren't interested.  The lines were too long and they went nuts while their parents tried to read the information.  I don't think they allowed strollers in.  Everyone was carrying their wiggling, whining little people.",
  "What a great museum. There are things here for the whole family. The health area blew me away. Wear comfortable walking shoes because there is much to see and do. There are lots of hands-on exhibits for the kids. ",
  "What a wonderful place to explore Nature and Science in a multitude of ways. Their huge dioramas of flora and fauna in their natural setting are historic and outstanding. Children are everywhere during certain hours, if only their parents would teach them to use inside voices and not run. See their website for all of the exhibits included in your admission as well as those that cost more, like the Dead Sea exhibit at the IMAX on Jerusalem that ranks  high one of my favorites list. If you are a local, it would be wise to join the museum, as even senior entry fees tend to be higher than other local museums. However, it's still worth it, and it'll take more than a day to see even the free exhibits. Parking can be a challenge so plan on a nice walk or have someone drop you in front.",
  "A spectacular major museum that is well worth a visit if you have 2-3 hours to spare in Denver. I particularly enjoyed the many dioramas of North American natural history, but there is also an excellent history of life gallery, with many cool dinosaurs and mammals, and lots of other galleries too. ",
  "The museum offers an amazing overnight program to schools in the city.  There were about 300 5th graders attending.  I chaperoned with my granddaughters class.  It was amazing and fun!!  This is a memory they will have forever!",
  "Russian artist extraordinaire Konovalenko has created some of the most amazing sculptures from gemstones.  His work must be seen to be appreciated.  Go see it!!  ",
  "Very big and has lots of cool things for the family to do and see. Very busy on the weekends, but still enjoyed ourselves.",
  "Having grown up in Colorado, I was lucky enough to bring my own daughter here for a visit!  \n\nJust like when I was a child, a full T-Rex skeleton (replica) greets guests upon entrance.  The Pre-Historic Journey exhibit on the third floor (containing all the dinosaur and early mammal fossils), as well as the taxidermy dioramas on the second floor, remain largely unchanged since I was a child.  However, I have noticed over the years that the information on placards and discussed in museum tours are updated.  Other exhibits have been changed since my youth including Expedition Health (formerly The Hall of Human Life) and Space Odyssey.  These are now more tailored to children but are very fun.  The Egyptian Mummies are also neat to see.\n\nAs a parent, I greatly appreciated The Discovery Zone on the second floor, which is like a mini children's museum.  It was great letting our daughter blow off some steam so she'd be calmer while my husband and I enjoyed the exhibits about international cultures.  As with many museums, there are also plenty of restrooms and places to eat, as well as a large gift shopped filled with overpriced items.\n\nWe concluded our tour with a trip to the Sky Terrace.  Here, the views of the Rocky Mountains and downtown Denver are unmatched!  \n\nGreat location adjacent to City Park...perfect way to spend the day with family!"

  "Tip - 1st Saturday of every month is free admission, although admission is reasonable any other day as well.  Free admission doesn't cover special exhibits.  As with most exhibits, know your audience; people who aren't into art, museums, or history probably aren't going to enjoy this.  For others, the variety of artwork here is outstanding: different areas covering NW native american pieces, Taos art society pieces, central American artwork, textile art, Star Wars original costumes, you name it.  For the art or history buff, this is a great place to spend several hours, or a few days if you can swing it.",
  "I like to compare the Denver Art Museum to the NY Metropolitan Museum (which I've seen)... wonderful exhibits...especially the special exhibits they feature, i.e. Stars Wars, Yves St Laurent (designer), Cartier, etc... Along with each special exhibit they set up a separate gift shop for that particular exhibit.  Of course there is a regular gift shop that features items to 'match' the art that is on display.",
  "The art museum is great here in denver...They have great traveling exhibits all the time and our kids love going and seeing the RED room with the RED foxes... we love that its a nice quite day with the kids.",
  "We have been to museums from Uganda to Taiwan, and the Denver Art Museum was an unexpected find. They have an exceptional collection of Western American Art. Many of the pieces are historically significant like Buckaroo from Alexander Phimister Proctor. Many of the works like Alexander Proctor, capture a history of the west prior to Europeans. In addition to the Maria Martinez\u2019s American Indian pottery, the museum has a wide variety of historic American art not found in such large quantity elsewhere in the world. \n\nThe gallery from South America was also incredible large. I am doubtful there is much art left in any of the Aztec and Mayan ruins, as most of appears to have landed in the Denver Art Museum. Although not as extravagant as some of the other collections, their Asian collection does provide a good cross representation of Asian art culture.  Arrive early, to ensure you can enjoy all the museum has to offer.",
  "For this price, you can pass up DAM. We are out of towners and that just happened to be a happy coincidence. Overall, we felt inundated with visual stimulation from all the collections. They led us to think deeply on modern issues, reflect on the beauty of the American West, and ponder the uniqueness of art from outside of the U.S. Lots of activities for the children at this museum. Nice bridge to other areas including a place to eat. Also gives access to Denver Public Library. Take the time to park in a lot as there is lots to see here and in the surrounding area. ",
  "As long as it\u2019s not during a free day, this place is nice to roam around and look at art on a relaxing day off. There\u2019s two different buildings connected by a bridge so make sure you don\u2019t miss the other one. Kids are free so they are usually present but not abundant as other museums are on specific days.",
  "I feel so grateful to live in a city with such an excellent museum. European Masters? Check! Amazing Asian exhibits? Check ( and I am a world history teacher) super cool modern Asian art oh yeah! Just so many great things and in a small enough chunk you can really spend time, but enjoy it all. Please don\u2019t leave without a stop here!",
  "There is something in the museum for everyone in the family.  We went to see the Monet collection and it was wonderful.  ",
  "Denver Art museum is curated with a lot of taste and is every eclectic in its vibe. We enjoyed our visit there and had a great time looking at all the arts, it has a lot of cool places which are kids friendly and they would have fun too while the adults can look at paintings etc. \nwe specially loved the mirror and lights gallery",
  "This museum has no permanent exhibition and the way they present art is not good. The exhibition about light had problems with highly reflective glass used for the paintings. The curation of lamps crossed the line between museum and product placement. Caf\u00e9 without tables and a 30% fine on those daring to visit from outside Colorado.",
  "Very cool!  It was free the first Saturday of the month-  not sure how long they are doing that,  but awesome exhibits!  The building itself was fantastic!  It\u2019s not very big,  so it only takes about 60-90 to get through,  but there were a few exhibits not open.  Probably wouldn\u2019t pay regular price for it since it kind small for the regular price.  "

  "What a great distillery experience! Dave really got into how Stranahan\u2019s got its start and where they are today. Can\u2019t say enough about the experience. Afterwords, we got to experience \u201cFuture Monday\u201d where Lucas makes some of his signature cocktails. I would highly recommend checking out Stranahan\u2019s! Can\u2019t wait to come back.",
  "What were we thinking doing two distillery tours in one afternoon?!? I tell you what, it was totally worth it. I'm not much of a whiskey drinker, but you have to check out Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey.\n\nWe had some time before the tour, so we bellied up to the bar. Steve B., mixologist and server, was really cool and explained the drinks to us. When it was time for the tour, we were introduced to Logan. He was an awesome tour guide, and has a great personality for it. He gave us a history of Stranahan's as well as what it takes to make their whiskey.\n\nDuring the tour, we were given some samples. Again, not being a whiskey drinker, I was surprised at how you go about tasting it. And it wasn't bad! Logan even showed us what happens to the whiskey when you add a little bit of water to it. We were able to keep our tasting glass as a souvenir, and some of our group took advantage of the discount after the tour to bring home a bottle or two!",
  "This is a fun, entertaining, and informative tour with some excellent whiskey involved!- what\u2019s not to like?!",
  "Two take-aways from our stop; first was just how friendly every staff member was at Stranahan's, and second, the whisky flight was outstanding.  The Snow Flake sample was one of the best whiskies that I have tasted.  I can see why the \"once a year\" event has folks lined up for days to acquire.  These guys understand whisky and are always happy to share their knowledge with you.",
  "Even though the heading is for Stranahan's Whiskey Tour, this review is for their Volunteer Bottling Crew. I have been on their wait list for several years and figured my name had fallen into the black hole of the volunteer bottling crew until BAMM, I finally received the email. The bottling session was a great time and did also contain a brief tour by Matt prior to hitting the bottling. Matt has the tour guide system wired and is very funny and informative. After the tour we were prepped on how the bottling line runs. Sterilizing the new bottles, adding heat shrink to their tops, corking, adding stickers, capping, boxing, etc etc. All a good time with a dram of the whiskey after every pallet filled. After a few hours of fast bottling, the day finished with a pizza lunch and a bottle of Stranahan's to all the volunteers. From what I understand the list is 28,000 long to get a spot, but it was a blast and I'd love to do it again. Cheers Stranahan's. Big Fan."

  "We walked the entire zoo and really enjoyed the baby giraffe, aquarium with bats, elephants, polar bear, llamas, hippos, and the gift shop is full of great finds!",
  "Pick a sunny day, grab the kids, wear some comfortable shoes, have a great walk and learn a few things about nature. If it's your 1st time, you might want to take the tram around to get an idea where everything is, then go back to your preferred exhibits. Love what they've done at Predator Ridge, so good to see the big cats with plenty of room in natural settings. It's easy to get around, plenty to see and do, well-maintained and has always been a trip our kids looked forward to.",
  "We recently visited the Denver Zoo on our trip from Chicago. We are members at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago so we have high standards for a zoo. Well the Denver Zoo did NOT disappoint! I loved that we paid for the entry fee but there were no other fees for exhibits. My 22 month old son is really into Dinosaurs right now and to have them all over the park and at no extra cost was great for him! \nHe loved the carousel and train ride, though we did have a melt down when that was over and a constant reminder every time the train went by till we wised up and went to the other part of the zoo. \nOn this day, all the animals were up and out and seemed more lively than we are used to at home. We really got a kick out of finally seeing elephants since we don't have any in Chicago. We love Polar Bears but judging by the neon green water, it has been some time since they were there. But seeing the Dinos for free as well as the komodo dragons made up for this! (Extra at Brookfield) \nThe new Tiger area was pretty awesome as was the active tiger! \n\nI will echo that there is a serious parking issue. We wasted way too much time in the parking deck that was full yet no one was communicating this or stopping people, it was like a black hole down there. Get there early or find a volunteer to park and let everyone else go in and start having fun. (We did that and it worked but we all did the walk in the end and it was 20 mins to walk all the way around to City Park, not fun after a long day, they need shuttles or something or another entrance)\n\nHonestly, we just kept saying how great this zoo was and how this is a must for any family!",
  "Get there early in the day as parking goes quickly.  Great for the kids and always fun.  We are members and go several times a year.",
  "Go early to get parking, otherwise find a side street it may be a little bit away. I went at noon on a day after snow but this day was 70, perfect for a zoo day, the line was about 50 people but that included families. \nAnimals were active and they have great exhibits. I didn\u2019t expect it to be so large as most zoos are smaller, but with great habits too. \nThey have animals I have never seen throughout so many zoos I\u2019ve been. Don\u2019t be afraid of the line, it goes fast. The zoo is big enough to accommodate everyone. \nYou won\u2019t be disappointed! I throughly enjoyed my time! \n",
  "The Denver Zoo is awesome! The most recent exhibit  is the Asian elephants bringing a little Asian spice to the Denver zoo.  In Winter Zoo lights is fun and great for the family! Don't forget to take lots of pictures and parking is always difficult so try the parking garage first.the food is a little expensive. The Denver Zoo has so many different animals, plenty of shade, bathrooms, and eating facilities.  Freely strolling peacocks always entertain the little ones.\nBeware the aggressive geese, though, especially near the \"train station\".  They will steal food from your hand, and there's nothing \"cute\" about a goose bite!\nKeep in mind, too, the high altitude, so a greater need for hydration and sunscreen in the summer.  In general, it is much easier to visit the park in the morning before the heat takes over and the animals (wisely) nap in the dark shade.\nBringing your own picnic is a great way to save money and makes for a special time.",
  "I can tell you that the Denver Zoo is worth a visit. They have a new section for elephants and tigers that are comparable to San Diego. I\u2019m still smiling from the sunny weather and craft beers...it was a good day at the zoo.",
  "We have been to the Denver zoo many times and each time is a wonderful experience.  They have babies to view in the spring, new buildings are going up, the animals seem very happy and well taken care of.  There are plenty of benches to sit and relax if you get tired of walking.  Overall wonderful experience.",
  "Nicely laid out zoo with both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Plenty of extras for the kids. In colder weather, the tropical exhibit house is a good spot to warm up. ",
  "It is just over two years since I last visited the Denver Zoo. Again, we found a lot of empty enclosures. However we were impressed with being able to get close up to many large animals, \nMany exhibits only have a very few animals for instance the tigers, there are just Siberian tigers, one male, one female. I hope that they have success in their breeding programme. Elephants, I understand that they only have males.\nThe primates area is well designed and provides the story of the primates evolution and families very well, however so many of the large primates are missing - chimpanzees and gorillas were absent.\nI was rather disappointed with the food outlets.\nLooking to the future, there are some new displays and buildings on the way and I suspect that I will visit again when I return to Denver.",
  "We visited the zoo in March 2020, mainly because we finished the things we really wanted to do in Denver early.  A good number of exhibits did not have animals, as it was still fairly cold.  However, the prices are raised starting March 1st.  The selection of animals we did see was decent, and we saw two of the animal feedings.  However, I was hoping to see move animals native to Colorado."

  "If you are interested in gaining history about one of Denver's most famous citizens, the Molly Brown House Museum should be on your list of sightseeing while in Denver!  I had a couple of hours to spare in the middle of the day, while in town for a conference.  I was able to walk over to the Molly Brown House Museum from my hotel on 16th Street with ease. Once arriving, the tour guide, Suzette, was amazing.  She was so knowledgeable about Margaret \"Molly\" and JJ Brown, their family, and what brought them to Denver.  Additionally, the restoration of the home is absolutely AMAZING!  To see how the Browns lived all those years ago, how fascinating.  This is definitely a tour to not miss.  Make sure you stop by the gift shop for some unique souvenirs including special Harney & Sons tea that is make specifically for the Molly Brown House Museum and a bookmark which is a replica of the impressive stain glass windows that are found inside the house.",
  "Amazing look into the past. Learn about Molly Brown\u2019s true story and catch a glimpse of her times. The house is beautiful and very well laid out for visitors to absorb the impact of the Browns\u2019 wealth, influence, and joys, as well as their trials and hardships. \n\nPro-tip: listen to the History Chicks\u2019 podcast episode on Molly Brown before you go!",
  "We enjoyed our visit to the Molly Brown house, learning much about this amazing woman (Margaret Brown), well known from the Broadway musical bearing her name and from Kathy Bates' portrayal of her in the movie \"Titanic\". Such lovely furnishings and accessories, a great example of upper class Denver at the turn of the 20th Century. ",
  "Enjoyed the tour and the story about Margaret Brown.  It gives you a glimpse into Denver in the early 1900's and while only about 10% of the furnishings are actually from the Brown family, they've done a nice job of securing other items from that time period.  And if you can't climb the steps, they have a virtual tour on an ipad which was a nice option.  I was glad I did the tour.",
  "This was the 2nd time I've taken this tour.  I found it just a enjoyable as the first time.  The history of the home, not to mention the furniture and rooms are top notch.  I'd recommend this tour when visiting Denver!",
  "I was fascinated by the Victorian decor and the stories about Margaret Brown.  I had to shed all my misconceptions from the movie, The Unsinkable Molly Brown.  Oddly I found the real Margaret Brown much more interesting than the fictional one.  The house is not large and the guided tour does not take long.",
  "As a history buff I thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and encouraged questions. Millions have been invested in restoring the home to its original state. I also learned a lot about Molly Brown. The movies don\u2019t tell her real story!  Worth a visit if you are interested in history. ",
  "When you are in Denver, make time to visit the Molly Brown House Museum.  Margaret \"Molly\" Brown is a well known survivor from the Titanic (Played by Kathy Bates in the famous movie)  The museum is an accurate portrayal of what the house looked like when Margaret and her husband, JJ, lived there in the early 1900's, and the museum tour dispels several myths about who she was and outlines the significant contributions to society she made.  There are frequent tours, and the gift shop is a study in influential women and Victorian charm.   Family friendly"

  "A lot of variety among the cars. It is not the Peterson, but it is fun.  Wear comfortable shoes, as you will do a lot of walking.",
  "We enjoyed this museum, particularly the current exhibit of little travel trailers. There are a variety of modes of transportation, including old bicycles, motorcycles, early autos, trains, planes, a helicopter, and a couple of old Denver streetcars. We enjoyed it all. Do be aware, that they will not allow you to bring in a purse or bag, such a a diaper bag. They do have some lockers you can use, but they don\u2019t look very secure. Plan ahead for the route you want to take, as there is construction on I -70, and there is only one way in and out.",
  "You don't \"have\" to be a car aficianado to enjoy this museum because the mostly automobile exhibits are reveal the evolution of modern transportation. You'll also find an old schooner wagon and an array of horse-drawn carriages, surreys, and wagons, and a display of early bicycles. There's an array of Indian motorcycles (in particular) and many others. There's an electric drag-racing motorcycle which was listed as accelerating to 60 mpg in under 1 second!. There's an amazing variety of rare old autos such as Packards, Studedakers, and even one sold by Sears. One thing that struck me was how large autos were in the early 1900s. There are also travel trailers, and a few aircraft mostly with ties to Colorado. The museum also has several locomotives on display, which were remarkable (to me, at least) for their extreme length. Don't miss the Model T in the far corner which you can sit in for a photo. There are placards and old advertising posters displayed with each exhibit to give some background. This was a really interesting way to spend a couple of hours, and could be of interest to kids if they're about mid-teens or older; but not a good choice to take younger children (unless they have an unusual interest in cars). I have recommended this Museum to several friends who I know get to Denver on occasion. If you have an interest in cars and other historical modes of transportation, this is definitely worth a couple of hours experiencing pristine original and restored vehicles.",
  "We were leaving Denver on a Tuesday, so we wanted to do something interesting on a Monday when a lot of museums are closed. The reviews of the Forney Museum of Transportation sounded good, so we gave it a try. It was terrific! No matter who you are, you can find something here that will appeal to you. Trains, motorcycles, bicycles, cars, even an airplane! Models and toy cars for the kids, too. It's fun to see old cars and think about what transportation was like in the last century - beautiful designs. The highlight for me was the actual car owned by Amelia Earhart! Another surprise was how huge the locomotive was and how complicated it was to run. Staff was great and the museum wasn't crowded at all. They require you to put bags and coats in a locker which means you don't have to carry all that stuff around with you. ",
  "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the museum with it\u2019s diverse selection of antique cars and other modes of transportation. A must see for all car buffs ... and their wives \ud83d\ude0a\n",
  "Fun museum to visit. Transportation history from wagons to today. I saw a couple of great examples of how what seems new is actually old (electric car from early 1900's, bicycle pedaled with a stand up elliptical action). Good place to spend a couple of hours or more. ",
  "This is one of Denver's least known gems.  Going to other area museums involves battling crowds, and the Forney Museum space is wide open with a fascinating variety of old cars, trains, bicycles, motorcycles, and other modes of transportation.  Seeing these well restored vehicles brings back nostalgia as well as a sense of fun imagining Amelia Earhart driving around Boston in her yellow Kissel or being a passenger on one of the luxury train cars in bygone days.  Having one of the very few the Big Boy locomotives adds to the visit.",
  "Wow so much to see. Old Cars, Motorcycles, Carriages, Bicycles and Trains.. very impressed with condition all items were in. A must see in Denver area. Give yourself a couple hours to walk through."

  "This is the block between 14th and 15th on Larimer in Lower downtown Denver. It has some great shops, galleries, and restaurants, and makes a cool place to explore or just sit down and people watch.  Some of the premier restaurants in the City are on this block, as well as some notable street festivals where the street is blocked off, think Chalk Art weekend in early June each year, and a few al fresco dining nights where the restaurants on the street serve their menus on the street itself when the street is closed, makes for a great evening out too.\n\nOften, the lights and flags and displayed are changed out and that makes for a great vibrant photo op as well.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out during any Denver visit. Parking on the street is by meter or valet.",
  "We explored Larimer Square for a morning and found many unique shops, eateries, and art galleries.  The lights in the trees made us want to return for an evening out.  Best part were the wonderful people we met and started up friendly conversations. ",
  "Larimer Square is the historic district where Denver was founded. In 1858, Green Russell struck gold at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The site of the original pioneer camp (known as Auraria at that time) soon became known as Larimer Square. Denver has expanded considerably over the years but the historic neighborhood remains the heart and soul of the Mile High City. It is home to numerous restaurants, shops and nightlife venues. It occupies a block of Larimer Street between 14th and 15th and can easily be reached on foot from downtown and LoDo. Larimer Square isn't for folks on a budget, unless you are just looking and not buying. Among the chic and elite boutiques are Eve, Element, Moda Man, Hailee Grace, Scarpaletto, Studio West and Victoriana Antique & Fine Jewelry. The list of fine restaurants includes Capital Grille, Ocean Prime, Bistro Vendome, Green Russell, Bubu, Russell's Smokehouse, Ted's Montana Grill, The Market and Euclid Hall Bar & Kitchen. For nightlife, the leading bars and clubs include Corridor 44, Comedy Works, Crimson Room, Vie Luxe Nightclub, Cru-A Wine Bar and Maloney's Tavern. There isn't a place like this in Chicago. Or maybe anywhere else.",
  "We walked or bused there every day.  There's lots to do for shopping and eating.  Obviously, don't just focus on the square itself but venture into the surrounding streets.\n\nCaution: buying anything here isn't cheap.  But if you want fancy clothing, decor or food, this is the place to be.",
  "It won't take you long to walk this quaint block but it's a great place to stop for a meal and visit a few interesting boutiques. \n\nIf you are at all into shoes and have a bit of money to spend on them, there is a shoe store half way down the block where the shoes are practically pieces of art. \n\nThe Market is a deli / bake shop where you can grab some food and sit inside or out. The baked goods looked amazing.",
  "No matter what time of year, there is something happening on Larimer.  It is the place to be.  A collection of unique shops laced with an unbelievable selection of outstanding restaurants.  No matter the weather, there is always a warm feeling along the street.  It is a place to see and be seen.  Only drawback is parking.  If you have a reservation at one of the restaurants (highly suggested) leave a little extra time for parking.  You'll leave with a happy feeling.",
  "Really enjoyed Larimer Square! Thewre are many shops and take your pick restaurants. Spent three evening here broswing and eating. Had been to downtown Denver area before but never stumbled across Larimer Square. I will visit this area again.",
  "If your a visitor you need to go to Larimer and experience the history of Denver - its a wonderful place to visit at Christmas time.",
  "Walked thru and felt chills by the lights strung above the street along with American flags. My son is in the USAF and I was proud to be an American in Denver in Larimer Square. Nice shops, bars and restaurants.",
  "An excellent area for nightlife. Many restaurants and bars are open late. Stores close a little early. Loving the lights on the street. Hardest part is finding a place to park. Expensive part of the night was the parking.",
  "Nice place to walk around. Interesting shops and restaurants. Not far from the convention centre and the hotels."

The fans are typical for the NFL and overall mostly polite and respectful to other fans.  What was the big downer on this visit was the way the stadium was prepared for the game.  A large snow fall happened the Tuesday before the game and the stands were not cleared of all the snow.  This afternoons game it was about 40 in the sun at game time and the snow under the seats began to melt which put freezing water at everyones feet during the game.  The Broncos played poorly and by halftime our feet we frozen even with heatpacks.  We left at the start of the third quarter because our teeth were chattering.  Bad game preparation SAF.",

There is a kids play area, a rec center, many trees and paths, tennis courts and other game areas.  In the summer there are free concerts in the park.  It's a great place to meet a group of friends, or make new ones.  ",
  "This was a great place for a walk in Denver! I took my kiddo here and she loved it as well. The paths are clearly marked for pedestrians and equipment on wheels (i.e. bikes, roller skates). There were families, couples, and individuals as we walked around the pond area. It's a quick walk to Bonnie Brae's Ice Cream shop as well through a very quaint neighborhood. I will most certainly come here again!",
  "Denver should be on everyone\u2019s list! What other city can you go to world renowned art, entrance to the great Rocky Mountains, walk in sculpture parks and live moderately with super sports!\nWonderful city, great food and such nice people!",
  "Wash Park, as it is known, is a haven for people from all corners of Denver and the suburbs. On my many visits there, I've seen runners, runners with dogs, runners with baby strollers, local celebrities playing fetch with their dogs on the lake, and picnickers. It is also a primary location for 5K runs, etc. that fundraise for charities. Some people just sit on the benches and read. Take a trip to Wash Park. You won't be disappointed."

  "I only had an hour and a half and that is the minimum amount of time you should spend here.  My favorites were the ski jump and the dustbowl house. The baseball exhibit was pretty cool too. I spent almost half the time on the second floor alone.",
  "I have never seen a museum in which adults, in addition to children, smiled and laughed so much.  It is, for the most part, an \"hands on\" experience place.  visitors can blow up a mine shaft mountain, collect eggs and shop in a 1920's prairie store, live through an epic dust storm in 1935, trade in Bents Old Fort, observe the ancient cliff dwellers in Mesa Verde's Balcony House, and much, much more.  As a bonus, through the end of the baseball season,  there is a private collection exhibit of baseball memorabilia that is a \"mini\" Hall of Fame.  Bats, gloves, personal possessions of some of the absolute greatest names in the history of baseball.  the HCC is a \"must\" place to visit for all members of the family at any age and for out-of-state visitors.  Don't miss it!",
  "I took the kids (10,7,5) the other day. We went on a Monday morning- great time to go and I imagine it does get busy on weekends/vacation days. It's a popular field trip spot but none of the classes I've taught have ever gone. This museum is just as cool as everyone says. Side note: use the Cultural Center parking. As you're driving past the front of the museum make a right onto 12th street and you'll see a small sign on the right for public parking. It can be easy to miss. I've also easily found parking in this lot on a regular school day weekday, so it doesn't usually seem to get too crowded. On the first floor is a kid explore/play space complete with virtual town citizens to \"guide\" you around, school area, general store, simulated Model T driving, replicated house, and barn play space with a twisty slide. Everything is hands on yet sophisticated enough to keep a wide variety of ages occupied. There were even adults without kids going through. Next we headed upstairs to the Colorado A-Z exhibit. Just as much fun and just as interactive, especially for adults! They cover a wide variety of topics/interests/areas of Colorado. Hands-on/interactive includes a trivia style game on a large screen, mining shaft elevator complete with shaking/noise, mining dynamite game, and our favorite, a simulated ski jump at Howelson Hill in Steamboat. I saw everyone from little kids to senior citizens genuinely having a lot of fun exploring and playing. That's rare at even the best museums! There looked to be a nice cafe and gift shop but we headed out front to eat lunches I'd brought. Nice big stone bench outside plus I noticed a table on the side, all separate from the cafe so it's totally acceptable to bring food, which I appreciate as a mom on a budget. I'd recommend this museum to anyone. It's wonderful! ",
  "this museum is not just for history buffs. It has exhibits that kids will enjoy, such as an one room school house, model T that visitors can take for a stationary ride. There is a screen in front of the car that  shows a movie of the countryside and the car moves as if driving over a bumpy road.\n  The museum also tackles more difficult events in Colorado's past; the battle of Sand Creek and Japanese internment camps, for example. All exhibits are creatively presented and visitors can decide how much information they want.\n  When I visited there were children around 8 years old to senior citizens, all having a good time.\n   Go in the afternoon 2 pm or later, when the school groups are gone.",
  "This lovely new facility in the heart of the Golden Triangle is a real plum for Denver.  Fun exhibits, something for history buffs and parents/grandparents  showing youngsters things about the west from skiing, mining, covered wagons to wild west days. Don't miss the giant map seen from above or explored on the floor. You can walk across the state in just a minute!",
  "Wow!  Is this place great.  Having grown up in Denver, I thought I had some good knowledge about the haps here in old CO.  Nope.  I was wrong.  Colorado has  rich and sometimes unfortunate historical stories to share.  While I won't spoil your visit, I can say that not only will you visit a mine, but get to see what life was like \"in the olden days\" and try your hand at skiing.  Other wonderful exhibits abound as well.  Don't miss the \"Homelessness in Colorado\" exhibit on the first level.  It is both eye-opening and interesting.   ",
  "We've been here several times, once even for a school gala fundraiser. The interior architecture is quite cool. It's a great space, and there are lots of different interactive exhibits on many different topics. The last time I went, I brought a lot of extended family members as part of a reunion, and I didn't allow enough time; there's a lot to see! That day, I specifically enjoyed an exhibit about native American Indian Coloradans.",
  "This modern \"museum\" does a great job telling the story of Colorado with many creative exhibits. As fairly new residents we found the \"Top 100\" exhibit to be  especially helpful to get the high points of CO history.  And I liked the special exhibit on the history of beer in our boozey state. We only wished we had budgeted time to stay longer in this great spot.",
  "My family and  I visited on a Friday afternoon the museum had several school groups in the building so the staff suggested we start on the top floor. I could have spent several hours on the top floor alone. the exhibits on The Ute native american is very engrossing.  Also the beer exhibit was quite informative. ",
  "its a gorgeous place to see some really great artifacts from the old west and its quite vacuous so you will have a great time walking around.  you can go for free when you get a culture pass from your Jeffco Library.  thats right, FREE  !!",
  "We almost didn't go to this museum after reading some of the negative reviews, however I realize most of those were written in 2018 or previous, so we took a chance & went. I'm so glad we did!  It is as much fun for adults as for kids...from being able to \"drive\" in a model T Ford, to being on a \"ski jump\", or taking the simulated \"elevator\" down the mine shaft , & \"set off\" a simulated TNT explosion,..there is so much to do!  I am a native of Colorado, but I learned some cool things about Colorado I had never known. The 4th floor had a cool exhibit of \"100 things Colorado\", which was awesome, and touched on many things, which I thought they did an excellent job of! 4th floor also has an exhibit about Colorado's history of microbrewery, which my husband enjoyed as did I. Then you can go down to the attached cafe & try an assortment of brews & snacks...what's not to like?!?"

  "There are many museums in Washington, DC, near where we live -- so we wanted to see things that were different.  This museum had many pieces of interest -- including from the Arts & Crafts era and all sorts of beautifully designed things for the home ... including radios, a sandwich warmer, a potato warmer, and mid-century modern furniture ... things I had seen in books, and now had the opportunity to see up close.  In addition, the Levan Deli is around the corner ... fantastic staff and fantastic food!",
  "I had never visited the initial museum location, but did follow the monumental movement of Vance Kirkland's brick studio from a dozen plus blocks away to its new, vibrant, amazing location. This had been on my radar, but not at a high level, until an artist friend mentioned to my visiting guests that the KIrkland was his favorite Denver museum. NOW i know why! It's mine too.\n\nStart your visit by entering the introductory gallery behind the ticket counter - and sit at the large table in the middle of the room. Unique pieces of Vance Kirkland's work show his evolution as a painter through their chronological display from left to right. Along with his paintings are amazing furniture and decorative items from the same period and it's a brilliant organizing theme that's carried out phenomenally well throughout the entire museum! As you sit at this table and take in the visual feast, rest your eyes and work out your ears. The music that accompanies a guest's visit is wonderfully curated as well and adds a nuanced, exceptional layer to the experience. \n\nAfter 15-30 minutes absorbing and exploring this space, go right to Kirkland's preserved studio at the opposite end of the museum. It's spectacular in every way and sets the tone for the entire visit. His space - even the straps he would hang from to paint large canvases - is preserved along with his and Hugh Grant's expansive collection of decorative arts and furniture. \n\nAfter you've done that the other collections can be accessed as you wish. I'm pretty linear so I started with the Arts & Crafts and Mission works from the late 1800s and then progressed along the galleries to the postmodern time. WONDERFUL!\n\nTake your time and don't miss this hidden gem in the Golden Triangle.",
  "Amazing collection. Highlights for me: Frank Lloyd Wright furnishings, Colorado paintings of 19th and 20th Century scenes, Arts & Crafts and Art Deco furniture and furnishings. Excellent display methodology which is studious but approachable. Vance Kirkland\u2019s realist paintings are memorable.",
  "The Kirkland is one of those places that is very individual, great to explore and is not just like all of the other museums.  Maybe not a great place for young kids as there is a lot that is \"don't touch\" here.",
  "The Kirkland Museum is located at 1311 Pearl, in Denver's Capitol Hill neighborhood. It is one of the gems of Denver. It is a small museum, in a beautiful historic building, with one of the best collections of mainly decorative art  from the first three-quarters of the 20th century in the USA and Europe (eg., Bauhaus, Harry Bertoia, Eames, Frank Lloyd Wright). It is also very strong on ceramics of the period (early Van Briggle, Teco, etc., to living artists like Betty Woodman), Colorado art, and the work of the late Colorado painter, Vance Kirkland. Changing exhibitions are also mounted, with subjects ranging from modernist furniture and design to Colorado Abstract Expressionism.  Walking into the Kirkland Museum is like entering the home of a great collector. Most of the art is mounted salon-style, with many works hung on walls, or placed on great examples of 20th-century furniture by major designers, so you can actually see it closely.  Thousands of rare and beautiful items are always on display, rather than in storage as in most museums. This creates a wonderful, lively, and stimulating artistic atmosphere.  Visiting curators and others have said this is one of the best small decorative arts museums in the USA. (Because of the open nature of many of the displays, children under 13 are not permitted.)  Admission is charged. Call for hours. Parking spaces in the neighborhood are not plentiful.  There is also dedicated parking across the street. Call and ask about it. The newly opened Clyfford Still Museum and the several buildings of the Denver Art Museum (one is the ONLY project by Gio Ponti in the US and a very fine example of his architecture) are only about a mile away.  So you can make a pleasant day of museum-going. Lunch can be had at the  nearby Denver Art Museum's excellent restaurant \"Palettes,\" (mid range to expensive) or across the plaza from the new Hamilton building at \"Beans and Wine\" (inexpensive coffee, sandwiches, soups, etc.). You'll enjoy the Kirkland very much and want to return to it again and again.",
  "Like furniture, glassware, paintings, household items with great design?  This is a place that will give you so.thing to see at every turn as well as background on Kirkland the artist.\n\nIt is the artists residence converted to display space.  Easily will keep you engaged for a couple of hours.  \n\nThere is an age limit, 13+, to enter which will exclude some families. Parking is very limited suggest looking for a place on the street.",
  "Fabulous! Could spend days there. Great representation of Colorado artists too. Don't miss the gift shop!",
  "This museum has artwork by Vance Kirkland, his studio, and a large collection of other art.  We really enjoyed Kirkland's paintings.  The other art was eclectic, including lots of local artists.  Some of the rooms were so packed full of stuff on the walls, in cabinets, and on the floor that it was overwhelming.  It is conveniently located near the Clyfford Still Museum and Denver Art Museum.",
  "Ornate museum housing beautiful works of art and home decor. It was interesting to see how many of today\u2019s furnishing are influenced by the furniture designs of the past. ",
  "Decorative arts, fine art, history and so much more.  I spent 3 hours just enjoying all the wonderful exhibits on view.  I would go back today.",
  "The building looks small, but there's a lot packed in there. It was unlike any art museum I've previously visited in the way things are grouped together for display. My husband, who normally doesn't enjoy art museums very much, loved it and was fascinated with so much of what he saw. It was a good n experience to go through the museum with friends. The gift shop is great too. "

You can bundle in citypass to make your visit cheaper or visit the website for a discount.",
  "This is a great aquarium with a good selection of well laid out exhibits. There is a large shark tank and another large tank which includes manta rays and moray eels. Good visibility throughout. We though the tiger enclosure in the centre of the aquarium seemed a little out of context. ",
  "The Aquarium has all the usual wonderful displays plus a few surprises, like the tigers and parrots in the jungle area and the awesome flash flood in the desert area. Feeding the stingrays, talking to the mermaids, and watching the 4D movie are a must. 4 adults and 1 child cost us around $125 for an adternoon's fun.",
  "Animals specially fishes always mesmerize me, DENVER aquarium was no exception, they have a lot of really cool and really colorful collection of fishes and other sea creatures. \nIt\u2019s a Must visit with kids - and don\u2019t forget to see the tiger and pet the sting rays ",
  "Early\nThis is a great aquarium that is easy to explore. We went on a weekday right when they opened and we had the whole place to ourselves. It was wonderful.  You will pay $8 for self park and one child and two adults was $64.50 for only the aquarium exhibits. I would plan one to two hours. There are many great  medium sized exhibits that are easy to navigate. The experience is much more intimate than some of the major aquariums and definitely less hassle. All ages should enjoy. I can recommend this aquarium and I will return again!\n\n",
  "I hadn\u2019t been to the Denver Aquarium in over 10 years, and went back this weekend. I think the presentation is amazing. It is really well laid out and makes it super easy to maneuver and see everything. The exhibits are great for kids and adults and allow an up close exposure to the fish and animals. ",
  "Overall this aquarium was nice with plenty of fish to see. The stingrays were so friendly and we loved interacting with them. My one year old loved seeing all the fish! The food was very good and prices were not bad.  I only gave a rating of two because of the tiger. There is no need for a tiger to be in that place, it is way too small and you could tell the tiger was stressed out. It made us very sad and I truly think it would be much better if that tiger was out of that building.",
  "Loved this aquarium. We spent half a day here and it was great. We go there right when it opened so it wasn't very busy. Many floor to ceiling viewing areas and a ton of information available. "

  "The State Capitol is definitely worth visiting for a couple of hours . Access is free unless you wish to go to the top of the dome which we decided against as we\u2019d already walked quite a distance in the heat. It is a beautiful building with lots to see especially the large tapestry depicting a timeline of women through Colorado history. There\u2019s also  a little cafe in the basement where one can have a drink. I noticed some reviews had comments about being harassed by homeless people in the park outside but we walked through it and , sadly, there were quite a few homeless people about but absolutely nobody bothered us.",
  "For this that like to see period architecture, this is a good opportunity for a free visit. The spaces are superb, the gold leaf covered dome glints in the sunshine (300 days a year apparently) and the historic and contemporary artwork is fascinating. There are 3 markers for \u2018one mile high\u2019 on the main steps, so take your pick. Worth a trip. Oh, and a very small cafe and restrooms....",
  "The capitol building is beautiful to look at, inside and out, with its rose marble and gold dome, but you can also take a free tour of the building and learn its history and see its unusual features.  Go to the Visitor Services desk on the main floor for a guided tour.  You do have to pass through security including bag screening.  If you wish to go to Mr. Brown's attic or the dome, expect to climb several flights of stairs.  You can tour most of the capitol without a guide except for the dome.  Our tour guide was most informative about the features of the building and its history.",
  "I came here to visit on March 30, 2018 for the 10am tour. There were about 12-14 people that were already there for the tour. Throughout the tour, keep in mind that as you're on the ground floors, it's a bit hot. Once you go towards the top, it gets a little cold.\n\nThe front of the Capitol has the \"ONE MILE ABOVE SEA LEVEL\" steps. To enter the building, you'll need to enter through the side. You'll go through security (kind of like going through TSA at the airport) to make sure you don't have anything crazy (weapons, drugs) on you.\n\nOnce you're in, on the left hand side, there's the information desk where you can sign up for the tours. Keep in mind that there are multiple floors where you're going to have to walk up the stairs. There is an elevator as well, but it can only take you to the last floor right before you use the stairs to get to the very top to see the views of Colorado.\n\nIt was great learning about the history of Colorado, how the Capitol Building started, what materials made the Capitol Building, the beautiful rooms, and most of all, the view at the very top of the Capitol. It was AMAZING. As a FYI (for your information), you will not be able to get to the top of the Capitol for the view unless you do a tour. Only the tour guides have access to the top so make sure you join in on one. Also, to sign up for the tour, you must get a badge to have access to it. Once the tour guides collect your badges at the end, you will then be able to climb the stairs and go to the top. From there, you can stay as long as you want. There is no elevator access here so you will need to be able to walk up these steps/stairs.\n\nI believe that tours happen every hour on the hour. You should call to confirm if anything!\n\nI would recommend stopping by the Capitol Building whether you're a local or out of town visiting. It's a great way to hear Colorado's history!",
  "The blue Capitol Hill is a very nice site to see. Located downtown of denver. There is lots to explore around the area nearby. There are parks, art museum, 16th mall street, restaurants nearby. Spend your time exploring. Be aware there are lots of homeless people around and parking fees can be expensive.",
  "The capitol is a great place to visit.  There is a lot of rich history in the building.  The structure and architecture are fabulous.  There are staff members throughout that are available to answer any questions or share share some of the history.  I would suggest getting in on the guided tour as solo visitors can not see certain areas unless part of the group.  Parking is not very convenient, but definitely worth the walk.",
  "I make it a point to try to visit the state capitol for every state capital that I travel to. Most of these edifices mimic the DC Capitol to some extent - the one in Santa Fe, NM being a notable exception - an so does the one in Denver. There were many homeless hanging and lying around the Capitol grounds, which detracted from the experience (even though I feel for people witch such fates). As with most capitols, you can walk around the Colorado State Capitol freely, obviously after going through a security check first, and see the House and Senate chambers. Be sure not to miss the elaborate Depression-style murals and the portraits of each US President.",
  "OK, we did do the pictures outside on the mile high step, I admit it!  The inside of the capitol is quite lovely, and our guided tour was fascinating.  We saw the House in session from the balcony as we toured the building.  The dome is not as bad a climb as I worried and the view of the inside and outside was worth it!",
  "Didn't take the full tour.   Went in on a brief grayline tour stop.  Glad we did, just right for us.  Beautiful brass, granite and murals.",
  "Go on a tour to get the full benefit of this place, but well worth a look at anytime. History and art collide beautifully in this space",
  "This is a lovely building with the mile high step as a feature.\nIt is well worth a trip as it puts this lovely city into perspective.\nThe whole city is really easy to get around."

  "Wings Over the Rockies Air & Space Museum is located on the former Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, Colorado, and is dedicated to the preservation of the history of Lowry AFB's operations from 1938 to 1944 in its collections, archives and research library. Major features of the museum's collection include the USAF's B-1A Lancer and B-52 Stratofortress bombers and many other military and general aviation aircraft. Located at 7711 East Academy Boulevard on the eastern edge of Denver, the museum includes more than 182,000 square feet of hangar space and 50 iconic aircraft dating from 1939 to 1990. Today, the museum is divided into two campuses. Exploration of Flight is a 15-acre campus located at Centennial Airport that is home to future-focused aviation and space galleries and exhibits. The Air & Space Museum focuses on the history and heritage of aviation and Lowry AFB. In its time, Lowry AFB was primarily a technical training center that graduated more than 1.1 million enlisted members and officers in skills ranging from armament to photography, aiding the country's efforts in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Cold War. It was one of Colorado's largest employers with approximately 10,000 military and civilian men and women providing an economic impact approaching $1 billion annually. Among aircraft on display are McDonnell-Douglas F-4E Phantom II, Grumman F-14A Tomcat, North American F-86H Sabre, LockheedT-33A Shooting Star, North American F-100D Super Sabre, McDonnell F-101B Voodoo, Learjet 24 executive jet transport, McDonnell Apollo Boilerplate BP-1101A boilerplate for Project Appolo, Piper J-3-65 Cub, Adam M-309 CarbonAero twin engine and Rand Robinson KR-1 home-built kit aircraft. Other exhibits include a Space Station Freedom command module mockup, U.S. NASA Astronauts with Colorado connections, Aircraft collection, both propeller and jet engines, Nuclear weapons, Cold War, Aviator uniforms, History of Avionics, Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame, former United Airlines DC-10 and Boeing 727-200 cockpits, and MaxFlight, a 360-degree full-motion flight simulator. It's a fascinating and comprehensive look into important aspects of this history of aviation. ",
  "The museum has over fifty aircraft housed in a mammoth hangar that remains at the site of the former Lowry Air Force Base. They have one of the two surviving B-1A Bombers of the four that were built with the other two being lost in crashes. The collection also includes an X-Wing Fighter from the \"Star Wars\" franchise, complete with R2-D2! They also have multiple immersive flight simulators where you can pilot several different types of aircraft.\nThis museum will be a real treat for fans of aviation, history and military aircraft.",
  "Wings Over the Rockies is a flat out fantastic, wonderful experience....if you are into aviation and space like me.  I loved ever minute of it.  The Harrison Ford intro film is great and really is evocative of the high emotions that we who love aviation do experience.  The aircraft displays are astounding.  They even have an example of Sierra Nevada's Dreamchaser spacecraft.  If you love aviation and space do go here.  It's great!",
  "This museum is one of the most amazing and delightful museums of its kind, not just in Denver, or Colorado, but, the entire region, if not, the country. This museum was built at the former Lowry Air Force Base. If you\u2019re into the history of airplanes and spacecraft, this museum will tickle your fancy (pique your interest). ",
  "This museum has a good collection of mainly US military aircraft, housed in what used to be a large hanger on what used to be a military airfield.\nYou cannot miss the entrance - there is a B52 bomber outside to welcome visitors.\nMost of the exhibits are US military aircraft, I would hope that at some time in the future, a greater variety of planes are added, there is still plenty of room to fit in extra exhibits\nThere were a number of very enthusiastic volunteers who were happy to talk about some of the displays.\nI found some of the most interesting displays were not the actual aircraft but smaller and poster displays such as the poster display on some aviator heroes from the world wars, German and British as well as American. Also, there are side room displays that should not be missed, such as the Colorado Air National Guard room and the room devoted to female aviators.\nAt one end of the hanger, displays look to the future, space and drone technology. \nAs we had a young child in our party, we did enjoy the excellent small kids space with books, building blocks child play areas.",
  "Has a nice collection of planes, considerably smaller than say the Smithsonian or the National Naval Air Museum but larger than other regional air museums.  The X-Wing fighter is an amusing addition to the museum though :)  Has a good assortment of different types of aircraft and a few nice additions like flight simulators for the kids.",
  "This museum gives you an up close and personal experience with a wide variety of aircraft, including a B1 bomber!  It was very interesting to see the various aircraft and read about how they were used throughout history!",
  "An amazing array of airplanes and flight simulators.  It even has some space stuff and a simulated international space station.  I highly recommend it!"

In 1858, after the discovery of gold in the river, General William Larimer founded Denver by putting down cottonwood logs in the center of a square-mile plot that would eventually be the current LoBo neighborhood. At that time, LoDo was a bustling and sometimes wild area known for its saloons and brothels and Union Station, where trains disembarked visitors coming into the city. From the 1870s to 1880s, LoDo was Denver's Chinatown, only to be torn down by race riots. By the mid-20th century, LoDo had become a skid row. As railroad transportation diminished, the importance of Union Station, LoDo's most prominent building, waned. But the neighborhood began to experience a renaissance and rebirth when the Lower Downtown Historic District was created in 1988. Its intent was to encourage historic preservation and to promote economic and social vitality in LoDo. Gradually, it became a destination neighborhood, new businesses opened, Coors Field opened in 1995, the Pepsi Center opened in 2000, and LoDo became a new and hip with clubs, restaurants, art galleries, boutiques and bars with old warehouses being converted into pricey new lofts and other new residential developments. LoDo is located in north-central Denver, near the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River, and is roughly bordered by Cherry Creek/Speer Boulevard, Wewatta Street, 20th Street and the alley between Market and Larimer Streets. Also included within LoDo are the Oxford Hotel, built in 1891 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Wynkoop Brewing Company, the Children's Museum of Denver and Elitch Gardens Amusement Park.",
  "Wonderful area of Denver with great hotels, Union Station, excellent restaurants, shopping, sports venues. Generally fun to be in.",
  "Come hungry for this awesome tour!  We had a great time learning the history of the Lower Downtown area of Denver while \u201csampling \u201c a variety of chefs\u2019 creativly crafted dishes.  Everything was delicious and the alcohol pairings were fabulous as well!  Rachel was a wonderful hostess! We would highly recommend the tour!",
  "Okay people, heres the skinny on LoDo. I grew up in Colorado and LoDo used to be the industrial/warehouse section of Denver. Back in the day unless you worked or delivered into those area's, you didnt travel that way, you stayed by the Tivoli or 16th street mall. The area is nice and there are great places to eat, bars, etc. Now you do need to be aware of your surroundings so don't be a statistic.If you get a chance, check out the Chop House, Jacksons Hole, Baseball Game or any one of the UpScale pubs on Larimer street. PF Changs is also a hit.",
  "Over the past five years, LoDo has exploded with drinking and dining options.  Although some of the older places have closed, you can walk in any direction from Union Station and find a dining option that meets your needs.  While LoDo restaurants are not as upscale as Lamier St. (16th-14th) Be forwarned that there are not many low cost options for a sit-down meal w/children - and reservations are almost always a necessity - especially on Fri-Sat.     Do a bit of research befoe coming to LoDo to locate the type of restaurant you want  - otherwise, you may find yourself wondering around trying to decide which restaurant looks the best. -only to find out that there is a 90 minute wait for a table.",

  "Like most places! Felt safe enough during the day but it would def be sketchy at late night or women alone. I\u2019m not a person who this bothers a lot until something happens to make me feel vulnerable. But a homeless man had an outburst during the middle of the day- I\u2019d say he was an addict from the looks of him- which I tried not to look but he was throwing stuff from a doorway! The businesses were interesting and the food was amazing at most the restaurants! There are some areas that you don\u2019t see as many homeless people but they are always a few. Mental illness and drugs seem to be a big part of the issue.",
  "If you have not been to Denver,, you will love being in LODO.\nLo(lower) Do(downtown) There are tons of restaurants, bars, stores and easy walking. ",
  "Walked around Lower Downtown and there's a lot of restaurant and places to have a drink. I was on my way to the Pepsi Center so it's a convenient location",
  "Love the artsy vibe in LoDo.  Dairy Block was one of my favorites and is such a fun part of the city to walk around in.",
  "The LODO is home to plenty or bars, restaurants, theater and off Broadway type venues that you can enjoy just about anything including recreational smokes and candy. A must see when traveling to Denver."

  "The cathedral is an impressive structure with its stained-glass windows and its traditional architecture, altar, and statues.  As the mother church for Catholics in the Denver Archdiocese, there is a lot to take pride in here.  It is worth a visit even for non-Catholics.  The greeters and ushers are polite and welcoming.  Parking is very difficult to find close to the cathedral, so expect to arrive early and search nearby parking lots if you are planning to attend services here.  Beware of the drunks across the street, and the area may not be very safe after dark.  We were glad to see a police officer standing guard on the front steps on a Sunday evening.  The cathedral is one of the eight pilgrimage sites in the Denver Archdiocese for the 2012-2013 Year of Faith.  Catholic Pilgrims who visit and pray the Our Father, Apostles' Creed, and invocations to the Blessed Virgin Mary may obtain an indulgence.  There is even a Pilgrimage Passport that can be downloaded from www.yearoffaith.archden.org and validated at the cathedral by answering a question in the passport about something unique in the cathedral.  Check it out!",
  "As a native, I've always loved this place with its beautiful stain glass windows contrasted with its white (for the most part) interior. Weekday masses are a small, informal gathering at 7am,12:10pm and 5:30pm. Saturday anticipated is at 4:30, while Sunday's offerings are abundant at 8:30,10:30,12:30 & 6:30. Major Masses are more likely to include incense and other added parts, though none is entirely in Latin. It's an excellent place to worship no matter when you go. However, there always has been the presence of the homeless and down-and-out primarily hanging around the front of the cathedral and in the side walkway area because of its urban location on one of Denver's most unsightly streets. Not dangerous...just know it's there and dress down for the environment--nothing fancy. Homeless people sometimes sit in the church itself,  but--this is a house for all of God's children and they bother no one--the church is generally open from 6 to the end of the last Mass of the day. There is a LITTLE parking lot that can be used for Non-Mass visits on Pennsylvania and Colfax but, otherwise it's pay alot for a general lot or try to get lucky with the few places there are on the street.",
  "This Cathedral is beautiful and worth a visit, even if you are not Catholic, it is truely breathtaking! Parking isn't so great, but worth the time to find a spot.",
  "I loved this Cathedral. I felt inspired as soon as I walked through the doors. As a protestant I'm always agog at Cathedrals and love to enter the sacred spaces. the stations of the cross are so exquisite. I was literally transported to the passion as I walked them. Must see!",
  "I was looking for the Cathedral and it is beautiful, Gothic style makes it unique in the area. Quiet place to hang out, appreciate its windows",
  "This cathedral is beautifully crafted, but that is not what makes it so special. It is so incredibly peaceful.",
  "My wife and I love to visit old Catholic churches. This Cathedral is one of the more beautiful we've visited.  The architecture is spectacular and the stained glass windows are awe inspiring.",
  "Stopped here briefly Saturday afternoon between our stop at the Capitol en route to the Molly Brown house.  Attractive church interior.  Peaceful and quiet.  A nice stop if seeking a few moments of prayerful solitude."

  "Plenty of open space. Beautiful lakes and water fountains. Lots of open fields. Lots of tennis courts. Plenty of parking spaces and places. Close to the Zoo and the Science museum. Great green place to walk and enjoy the outdoors.",
  "City Park is an urban park and neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, 330 acres in the east-central area of town that is home to the Denver Zoo, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Ferril and Duck Lakes and a boathouse. To the immediate north of the park is the City Park Golf Course. The largest park in Denver, City Park was established in 1880 and is one of the oldest public spaces in Denver, located slightly more than a mile east of the downtown area. Its boundaries are York Street to the west, 17th Avenue to the south, Colorado Boulevard to the east and 23rd Avenue to the north. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. By the start of the 20th century, Ferril Lake, the Denver Zoo and the landmark boat pavilion, with a Spanish-style design by architects John Humphreys and William Fisher, were all developed in the park. Reinhard Schuetz, a German immigrant who was the head landscaper for Denver, formalized the design of the park by planting formal gardens, laying down carriage ways and creating the East High School Esplanade into the park. In 1908, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science was opened to the public. It was built on the eastern edge of the park, on the highest elevation, and now is famous for its views of downtown Denver and the Rocky Mountains beyond. Today, the Colfax neighborhood in City Park has become a popular area with many hip restaurants, stores and other businesses, including the Tattered Cover book store and the Twist & Shout record store, Thousands of visitors visit the cultural institutions located within the park. One of the most popular features continues to be the recently renovated Prismatic Fountain at Ferril Lake, which dates to 1908. The park is particularly frantic during the summer wth free concerts, boat rentals and paddleboats. It also is a great place for dog-walking.",

  "6 pm every Sunday in summer there is a free outdoor concert and people bring blankets to sit or lawn chairs. You can bring picnic or buy food from venders. I live in denver and we always go to see a few concerts throughout the summer.  Be mindful of weather as it can often rain in the denver afternoon.  No glass containers.\n\n",
  "I've been walking Denver City Park almost everyday now since the first of January.  The park crew keep it very well maintained as it must be difficult with the number of geese around and the number of visitors with dogs.  Most people are pretty good about cleaning up after their pets, but unfortunately not all.  There are a couple of playground areas for children and some nice benches to relax and ponder the day by the one of three lakes.  There is a building here that overlooks the water and can be rented out for celebrations.  In the summer, they offer the pedal boats.  I've seen an American Bald Eagle here several times and a red fox.  Keep your eyes open and you may too. There are tennis courts and horse shoe games as well has many walking trails that take you throughout the park.  Watch for bikers as they use the paved roads within the park.   I wouldn't recommend this park after dark because as with many city parks, it can become unsafe if you're alone.  If you have time, visit the zoo which is right next door or the Nature and Science Museum after you've had a picnic in the park. :) ",
  "I live in Park Hill the eastern border of City Park.  It is the iconic image of Denver.  2 great Playgrounds, the Zoo, Nature and Science Museum, IMAX Theater,  the Fountains and the Martin Luther King Monument make for a full day.  Much more than a Park it is truly the \"Jewell\" of the Denver Park System.\n\nBring a picnic as food options are very very limited.",
  "City park, like everywhere else in the Denver metro has been completely overrun by drug addicted homeless who migrated here when marijuana became legal. We are natives and have watched this city turn into a dumpster fire. During our most recent trip to City Park (with our 8, 5, and 1 year old children) we encountered a used condom and a crack pipe. Hooray. There\u2019s nothing like exposure to disease and drugs during a trip to the museum to make you want to run for the hills. This city is gross now. We hate it here. Good luck to anyone who comes here- I hope you don\u2019t find or step on a drug needle.",
  "the view had the mountains behind the buildings, it was a nice picture but very hard to capture. You have to stand on the steps behind the denver museum to capture it the right way.",
  "This gorgeous park is situated right next to The Denver Zoo and Museum of Nature and Science. My mom and I took a stroll and enjoyed the geese and water view for a good hour after lunch.",
  "This is a really nice park close to where I was staying. I walked past tennis courts used by a local high school. They have Greenhouse a Zoo and a Science Museum.",
  "After visiting the science and nature museum, we needed to unwind from the stress of all the screaming children in the museum.  We took a nice, quiet walk around the lake. The grounds were in excellent shape, no trash and no homeless people looking for handouts.  This is a hidden gem in the middle of a big city."

  "Clyfford Still is a preeminent 20th Century painter whose work is fundamental to America's modern art history.  This museum was built specifically and only to feature his work, which is not very broadly otherwise distributed.  The building itself is gorgeous, and there's a fun English pub w a huge scotch collection just across the street. ",
  "This museum is relatively small, and is devoted to a single artist, the Abstract Expressionist Clyfford Still. This well curated museum does a fine job of tracing the evolution of Still's work. The paintings are impressive; his letters and other materials help to explain his thinking.\n\nThis is well worth a visit.",
  "I, a well travelled BFA Art Major, was unaware that the Clyfford Still Museum was in Denver (just a few feet from the Denver Art Museum). Still's Museum holds 90% of all the art he produced... so seeing it, in situ, is an exhilarating experience. His genius becomes apparant after a tour of the galleries. Most people know Jackson Pollak and Mark Rothko but Clyfford Still's art is of equal importance in the Abstract Expressionist period.",
  "Enjoyable museum showcasing Clyfford Still's work.  It was very interesting to see his pieces in roughly chronological order, showing his changing style.  I'm not sure I've ever seen it so thoroughly done at any museum for any artist.  This may have been my favorite of the art museums I visited in Denver (of at least 4 total).  I believe they also rotate the pieces on display, so if I lived in Denver, I might visit a few times a year.",
  "What a museum. As his paintings are not found in other museums this really is the place. Didn\u2019t expect to find abstract expressionism in Denver. Must see for those interested in modern art.",
  "Love the idea of a museum housing an artist\u2019s entire work throughout their creative journey. You can therefore really appreciate the growth of Still as an artist and his artistry. The building is also very beautiful with a ceiling that allows natural light to filter through.",
  "Dropped into this museum and was VERY pleasantly surprised! ONLY works by Clyfford Still are on exhibition - which allowed me to really see and experience his artistic evolution. Would recommend.",
  "located just behind the DAM is the Clyfford Still Museum.  His art is Abstract Expressionism and fits in well with Mark Rothko and Robert Motherwell.  His work was unknown to me until this visit."

  "I thought this was so cool---there are only a few mints in the United States so take the time to visit---You also get a neat gift (ours was a proof penny from the Washington Mint) the first one ever made from there!  The stories from the tour guide are authentic and interesting---total time maybe an hour).  Be sure to go to the gift shop and get a souvenir (I bought a couple proof sets to acnowledge my trip)  The only souvenir I have ever purchased that actually has a value!!\nHELPFUL HINT:  get in line really early (like 6:00 a.m--to get tickets for one of the tours)!\n",
  "They have great displays on the history of coins in general and of coin-making in the US. It was also a thrill to see $1.5M in front of your eyes in the form of 3 gold bars, an example of the gold stored there. The guides are very knowledgeable. The whole experience is very well managed. As others have noted, you go the day you want to tour. Get there at 7 am or before if you can. Get the free tickets to the time of the tour you want to attend. Then you need to arrive a 1/2 hour before your tour time. But that time passes quickly because the waiting area has very interesting displays on the history of coins. The tour itself is about 45 minutes. Highly recommend making the effort to see this.",
  "Follow the details on the website for getting tickets. Current procedure is first-come, first-served at 7am for ticket pickup.  No bags.  No cameras.  Phones off.  No pocketkives, food/drink, etc.  You will go through metal detectors similar to an airport.\n\nI arrived 6:50am on Dec 20, and was #7 in line.  Did the 8am tour, of about 45 mins.\n\nAs a former coin collector, I found this absolutely amazing.  Pennies are about 60% of production, and they make coins 24x7.  Also, about 17% of the US gold bullion is stored here (guess is on the 3rd basement level).\n\nMy tour guide was way too active for an 8am tour.  I was unable to stump him with my esoteric questions of US Mint operations.\n\nWhile on the observation deck, our tour party saw pennies getting pressed.  Observant tour members saw commemorative quarters being pressed, and stopped due to quality issues (die wear apparently), with a die change, inspections, and resumption of production.\n\nThe gift shop sells proof and uncirculated sets from the year and maybe past.  They may also have commemorative coins.  Also all sorts of coin supplies and expected trinkets.\n\nThe gift shop has a quarter change machine that will output uncirculated quarters for any bill inserted.  No extra fee.\n\nRecommended to park in the 490 W 14th garage a block away.  $5/2 hours; $9/6 hours.\n",
  "It has actually been awhile since I have visited the Mint.  I was there for a job interview and was able to see the coin making close up as they took me down on the floor where you don't get to go on the tour as it is too dangerous.  I went on a tour before 9/11 and it was very interesting to see the coins being made.  Everyone had to empty their pockets of change, even the employees.   ",
  "The tour was great, really went by quickly. Lots to see. Make sure NOT to bring a bag/backpack as there is no place to store it as it's not allowed on the tour",
  "Truly a piece of history that extends to today.  Take the tour.  This is great for adults and well as kids.  Just plain awesome.",
  "We arrived at the airport in Denver about 9:30 am, and were not able to get to the Mint until 11:00 am, but they still had two tour times in the afternoon open. (End of January).  It was a wonderful tour, with an excellent guide.  We loved hearing about how coins are made, and some history behind it.  It was totally worth the effort of getting tickets and coming back later that day.",

It is clean with massive halls that can accommodate thousands of guests, vendors, participants and multiple events.  The grounds have a mall style entrance in the front, and the back has a grassy area for attendees to enjoy with a view of the front range.  Overall for a convention center Denver has done a great job with this facility.",

  "Chessman Park is a nice park to hang out in, as long as you do not mind sitting on the ground or bringing your own seating, for the only seating that is provided are the occasional park benches scattered along the sidewalks. There is not enough opportunity to find shade once you're away from the edges of the park, so if it is a particularly sunny day it is also recommended that you bring your own shade, or some sunscreen. The park is always well groomed, getting mowed daily when the weather permits. There is a nice gravel running path with is good for an easy, flat, 15-30 minute run, depending on your speed. The sidewalks are well maintained with edging, and generally pretty well salted in the winter. Dogs are allowed, but make sure to keep them on-leash or risk being ticketed by a park ranger. Park rangers patrol all of the local parks, particularly the well-used ones, during the daytime, and extra heavily on weekends. This park is great for a picnic with friends, for playing soccer or volleyball (you can often see others playing and there are regularly scheduled pickup games), for walking your dog, or reading a book. You can even sometimes find somewhere to hang your hammock. If you're looking for a nice place to have a group get together where you will not have to fight strangers over finding a place to post up, this is it. ",
  "In the heart of Denver, this is a popular place to spend an afternoon.  Bring your dog, bring your friends, bring a picnic, bring a frisbee, there is room for all.  Also a very popular place to take photos at. \nAnd for those who like to ghost hunt, this is one of the most haunted locations in Denver.   ",
  "The park is really nice.  If you don't live nearby, finding a parking spot can be difficult. \n\nPavilion is really nice, all marble. ",
  "This is a lovely park where people were walking dogs, jogging or enjoying the warm sun on a winter's day.  It has a lovely neoclassic pavilion in the park as well.  ",
  "Wonderful large and open lawn space with room for frisbee, football toss, volleyball, walking the dog, and walking around the park on the sidewalk. Pretty flower gardens by the pavilion and the pavilion itself is beautiful. Great place to relax!",
  "Cheesman park is one of the oldest parks in the Denver area.  It was originally a cemetery.  The contractor who was tasked with moving the graves was paid by the casket. He allegedly cheated the city by faking the movement of hundreds of graves. Many were never moved and are still on the grounds. Hauntings in the area were the inspiration for the movie \"Poltergeist.\"",
  "I live 2 blocks away from Cheesman Park and one thing that I love so much about it is that it's super clean and doesn't have any geese poop. The entire path around the park is a little over a mile so it's nice for a little run after work. They do have a bike path that runs on the inside of the park too.\n\nIt's also way less crowded than Washington Park and not as big as City Park so it's the perfect size. The Pavillion area is known as a place to take photos too.\n\nStop on by!",
  "This is a nice, green, and attractive park in Denver with lots of locals doing a variety of activities. This park is fabled to be haunted, especially some of the unique structures in it. Visited during the day, and had a nice time checking out the paths."
