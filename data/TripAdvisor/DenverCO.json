  "Walking thru the gardens is not just about plants--there are sculptures, seating areas to reflect and much more. Gaze at the fish and stand under a tall tree--all nice escapes for the day .",
  "Because of the pandemic all the indoor displays were closed. \nOutdoors was pretty dead and desolate nothing really was in bloom - no bonsai on display. Nice layout and spread but really nothing much to enjoy maybe because of the weather and the current global event.",
  "We went to the botanic gardens for their winter Christmas display - it was breath taking and a wonderful experience for the entire family - HIGHLY recommended.",
  "Early March is possibly not thought of as the best time to visit a Botanic Gardens, however we really enjoyed our visit to the gardens. Spring flowers are blooming and the trees are budding. The Japanese Gardens were looking beautiful. \nWe visited the science building and had an excellent one to one talk on microscopic hairs on plants. Absolutely fascinating. \nAs always, there were beautiful blooming orchids in the hot houses. ",
  "Staff was friendly and view spectacular. A must-see in Denver even if you don\u2019t have a green thumb. The science pyramid is informative and the gardens enchanting. "

  "I think I've said it all in the title. Getting there from Denver area is a scenic drive in itself. The grove is amazing. Goats can be seen. It is awesome.",
  "When you get to the top you feel like your on top of the world - you won't be disappointed!!!!  The drive up to the top is incrediately.",
  "Definitely worth traveling in your own car. But be careful when planning your trip because: (1) the road may be closed because of snow even in the middle of summer and (2) the road is narrow and may be icy. We did not have any problems with the high altitude, but I heard that some people did. There is a short but a bit challenging walk from the parking lot to the summit, so take good shoes. And of course, have warm clothes because it is really high and the temperature may be quite low.",
  "Somewhat daunting drive up to the peak. High elevation is noticeable and the harshness of the wind,temperature, and terrain is memorable",
  "I didn't know this until I went, but you can only get all the way to the top between Memorial Day & Labor Day. Before Memorial Day & after Labor Day you can only drive up to Summit Lake, but can walk the rest (if you are prepared for the walk/hike the last few miles up the road!). I could definitely feel the altitude difference at Summit Lake, so be prepared for that. The drive was fun & entertaining."

Now it's a booming visitor center filled with restaurants, shops, a hotel and lots of happy ids running through the fountains during the summer.  You can still catch a train or a bus, but you'll enjoy the experience so much more now.",
  "As soon as we learned how to use the rail system we used it! Talk about easy. If you still do not know the security was fabulous to us & helped us. Even told us where to eat.",

Now granted we were between meals, and weren't into having a drink at 10:00 am, so while it was pretty, I'm not sure all the hype, unless you need to catch a train. \nIt's pretty busy with a lot of people getting food and waiting for trains.

  "Excellent location in the heart of downtown Denver. You can drive, take the train, or ride the bus up the 16th street mall. The air is electric and the crowds are friendly. The food is a cut above other stadiums I have had the luck to see. You can watch from your seat or from one of several bars located throughout the stadium. Be sure to head there early as it is a popular venue for Denver fans. Follow the crowds toward one of the best experiences you can imagine. They also have a store for any fan who forgot to wear his/her purple. It's safe and fun. If you don't have a lot of cash you can buy rock pile tickets for a reasonable price.",
  "Affordable professional sports option for families.  Great memories and sunsets.  Variety of food offered.",
  "Our tour guide was so cute and adorable. You can tell she has a real interest in passion in her job, and it just shines through in her story telling. Her name slips my mind, but I remember she had been there since the park opened 26 years ago. We saw many aspects of the park and learned some history of it, and the surounding areas. Fun fact, Blue Moon beer originated here under a different name, but the building is still there. I love this ball park and always have, but seeing it in person is really what you need to do. I definitely want to return to catch a game here someday."

  "Echo Lake, Summit Lake, and the summit of Mt Evans are the places that you can easily reach with your car and have an experience of high mountains.",
  "We drove this scenic byway hoping to drive to Mt. Evans but only made it to Echo Lake as the road to the peak was already closed in October. However we drove all the way to Evergreen and it was a great drive on a nice road with colorful aspen leaves to look at. Juniper Pass was a great stop along the way.",
  "We drive the Mt. Evans Scenic Byway (Highway 5) at least once every summer.   Via I-70 from downtown Denver to Idaho Springs exit 240 is about 32.5 miles, to Highway 103.  Highway 5 is about 13 miles of Chicago Creek, past Chicago Forks and just beyond picuresque Echo Lake 10,600'.  Denver Botanic Gardens Mount Goliath Dos Chappell Nature Center,  +3 miles) at about 11,500' is advised; with hikes among wildflowers and bristlecone pines.  Continuing UP Highway 5, views open to all directions, wildflowers line the road, and critters appear (marmots, pika, bighorns, mountain goats, and birds)  Sharp dropoffs beside the road are common, hence the warning about  acrophobia/a\ngoraphobia.  Six miles to Summit Lake, 13,000' is stunning, with views up, down, sideways; parking is often crowded.  Great views of the lake with Mt. Evans behind.  Many, many alpine wildflowers through July into August.  Occasionally wildlife near the lake.  The final 5+ miles to \"summit parking\" at 14,130 abounds with switchbacks, pulloffs, sights, and often animals.  Pika are elusive, marmots like to eat and sun, bighorns wander, and mountain goat are often along this section and/or at the top.  Views from Longs Peak to Pikes Peak north and south, to the Collegiate Peaks west, and Denver and the Great Plains east.  A short gravel walk/crawl to the peak at 14,250 is available.  Water, sunscreen, snacks/food as this is a half to full day venture (120 miles round trip minimum) from downtown Denver.  Bring layers of clothing.",
  "Did this attraction on the last day of a 2 week trip around the Colorado rockies . A lovely drive , hairy at times, and often takes much longer than planned due to travelling at the slowest speed of the car in front. We were lucky the road had only recently reopened after a late snowfall in June.  But worth the travel right up to 14000 , as we were able to see all the mountains we had explored during the trip ."

I particularly enjoyed the many dioramas of North American natural history, but there is also an excellent history of life gallery, with many cool dinosaurs and mammals, and lots of other galleries too. ",
  "The museum offers an amazing overnight program to schools in the city.  There were about 300 5th graders attending.  I chaperoned with my granddaughters class.  It was amazing and fun!!  This is a memory they will have forever!",
  "Russian artist extraordinaire Konovalenko has created some of the most amazing sculptures from gemstones.  His work must be seen to be appreciated.  Go see it!!  ",
  "Very big and has lots of cool things for the family to do and see. Very busy on the weekends, but still enjoyed ourselves.",
  "Having grown up in Colorado, I was lucky enough to bring my own daughter here for a visit!  \n\nJust like when I was a child, a full T-Rex skeleton (replica) greets guests upon entrance.  The Pre-Historic Journey exhibit on the third floor (containing all the dinosaur and early mammal fossils), as well as the taxidermy dioramas on the second floor, remain largely unchanged since I was a child.  However, I have noticed over the years that the information on placards and discussed in museum tours are updated.  Other exhibits have been changed since my youth including Expedition Health (formerly The Hall of Human Life) and Space Odyssey.  These are now more tailored to children but are very fun.  The Egyptian Mummies are also neat to see.\n\nAs a parent, I greatly appreciated The Discovery Zone on the second floor, which is like a mini children's museum.  It was great letting our daughter blow off some steam so she'd be calmer while my husband and I enjoyed the exhibits about international cultures.  As with many museums, there are also plenty of restrooms and places to eat, as well as a large gift shopped filled with overpriced items.\n\nWe concluded our tour with a trip to the Sky Terrace.  Here, the views of the Rocky Mountains and downtown Denver are unmatched!  \n\nGreat location adjacent to City Park...perfect way to spend the day with family!"

  "What were we thinking doing two distillery tours in one afternoon?!? I tell you what, it was totally worth it. I'm not much of a whiskey drinker, but you have to check out Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey.\n\nWe had some time before the tour, so we bellied up to the bar. Steve B., mixologist and server, was really cool and explained the drinks to us. When it was time for the tour, we were introduced to Logan. He was an awesome tour guide, and has a great personality for it. He gave us a history of Stranahan's as well as what it takes to make their whiskey.\n\nDuring the tour, we were given some samples. Again, not being a whiskey drinker, I was surprised at how you go about tasting it. And it wasn't bad! Logan even showed us what happens to the whiskey when you add a little bit of water to it. We were able to keep our tasting glass as a souvenir, and some of our group took advantage of the discount after the tour to bring home a bottle or two!",
  "This is a fun, entertaining, and informative tour with some excellent whiskey involved!- what\u2019s not to like?!",
  "Two take-aways from our stop; first was just how friendly every staff member was at Stranahan's, and second, the whisky flight was outstanding.  The Snow Flake sample was one of the best whiskies that I have tasted.  I can see why the \"once a year\" event has folks lined up for days to acquire.  These guys understand whisky and are always happy to share their knowledge with you.",
  "Even though the heading is for Stranahan's Whiskey Tour, this review is for their Volunteer Bottling Crew. I have been on their wait list for several years and figured my name had fallen into the black hole of the volunteer bottling crew until BAMM, I finally received the email. The bottling session was a great time and did also contain a brief tour by Matt prior to hitting the bottling. Matt has the tour guide system wired and is very funny and informative. After the tour we were prepped on how the bottling line runs. Sterilizing the new bottles, adding heat shrink to their tops, corking, adding stickers, capping, boxing, etc etc. All a good time with a dram of the whiskey after every pallet filled. After a few hours of fast bottling, the day finished with a pizza lunch and a bottle of Stranahan's to all the volunteers. From what I understand the list is 28,000 long to get a spot, but it was a blast and I'd love to do it again. Cheers Stranahan's. Big Fan."

They have babies to view in the spring, new buildings are going up, the animals seem very happy and well taken care of.  There are plenty of benches to sit and relax if you get tired of walking.  Overall wonderful experience.",
  "Nicely laid out zoo with both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Plenty of extras for the kids. In colder weather, the tropical exhibit house is a good spot to warm up. ",
  "It is just over two years since I last visited the Denver Zoo. Again, we found a lot of empty enclosures. However we were impressed with being able to get close up to many large animals, \nMany exhibits only have a very few animals for instance the tigers, there are just Siberian tigers, one male, one female. I hope that they have success in their breeding programme. Elephants, I understand that they only have males.\nThe primates area is well designed and provides the story of the primates evolution and families very well, however so many of the large primates are missing - chimpanzees and gorillas were absent.\nI was rather disappointed with the food outlets.\nLooking to the future, there are some new displays and buildings on the way and I suspect that I will visit again when I return to Denver.",
  "We visited the zoo in March 2020, mainly because we finished the things we really wanted to do in Denver early.  A good number of exhibits did not have animals, as it was still fairly cold.  However, the prices are raised starting March 1st.  The selection of animals we did see was decent, and we saw two of the animal feedings.  However, I was hoping to see move animals native to Colorado."

And if you can't climb the steps, they have a virtual tour on an ipad which was a nice option.  I was glad I did the tour.",

Oddly I found the real Margaret Brown much more interesting than the fictional one.  The house is not large and the guided tour does not take long.",

I also learned a lot about Molly Brown. The movies don\u2019t tell her real story!  Worth a visit if you are interested in history. ",
  "When you are in Denver, make time to visit the Molly Brown House Museum.  Margaret \"Molly\" Brown is a well known survivor from the Titanic (Played by Kathy Bates in the famous movie)  The museum is an accurate portrayal of what the house looked like when Margaret and her husband, JJ, lived there in the early 1900's, and the museum tour dispels several myths about who she was and outlines the significant contributions to society she made.  There are frequent tours, and the gift shop is a study in influential women and Victorian charm.   Family friendly"

The reviews of the Forney Museum of Transportation sounded good, so we gave it a try. It was terrific! No matter who you are, you can find something here that will appeal to you. Trains, motorcycles, bicycles, cars, even an airplane! Models and toy cars for the kids, too. It's fun to see old cars and think about what transportation was like in the last century - beautiful designs. The highlight for me was the actual car owned by Amelia Earhart! Another surprise was how huge the locomotive was and how complicated it was to run. Staff was great and the museum wasn't crowded at all. They require you to put bags and coats in a locker which means you don't have to carry all that stuff around with you. ",

  "This is one of Denver's least known gems.  Going to other area museums involves battling crowds, and the Forney Museum space is wide open with a fascinating variety of old cars, trains, bicycles, motorcycles, and other modes of transportation.  Seeing these well restored vehicles brings back nostalgia as well as a sense of fun imagining Amelia Earhart driving around Boston in her yellow Kissel or being a passenger on one of the luxury train cars in bygone days.  Having one of the very few the Big Boy locomotives adds to the visit.",

  "its a gorgeous place to see some really great artifacts from the old west and its quite vacuous so you will have a great time walking around.  you can go for free when you get a culture pass from your Jeffco Library.  thats right, FREE  !!",
  "We almost didn't go to this museum after reading some of the negative reviews, however I realize most of those were written in 2018 or previous, so we took a chance & went. I'm so glad we did!  It is as much fun for adults as for kids...from being able to \"drive\" in a model T Ford, to being on a \"ski jump\", or taking the simulated \"elevator\" down the mine shaft , & \"set off\" a simulated TNT explosion,..there is so much to do!  I am a native of Colorado, but I learned some cool things about Colorado I had never known. The 4th floor had a cool exhibit of \"100 things Colorado\", which was awesome, and touched on many things, which I thought they did an excellent job of! 4th floor also has an exhibit about Colorado's history of microbrewery, which my husband enjoyed as did I. Then you can go down to the attached cafe & try an assortment of brews & snacks...what's not to like?!?"

  "This museum has artwork by Vance Kirkland, his studio, and a large collection of other art.  We really enjoyed Kirkland's paintings.  The other art was eclectic, including lots of local artists.  Some of the rooms were so packed full of stuff on the walls, in cabinets, and on the floor that it was overwhelming.  It is conveniently located near the Clyfford Still Museum and Denver Art Museum.",

  "Decorative arts, fine art, history and so much more.  I spent 3 hours just enjoying all the wonderful exhibits on view.  I would go back today.",
  "The building looks small, but there's a lot packed in there. It was unlike any art museum I've previously visited in the way things are grouped together for display. My husband, who normally doesn't enjoy art museums very much, loved it and was fascinated with so much of what he saw. It was a good n experience to go through the museum with friends.

  "Early\nThis is a great aquarium that is easy to explore. We went on a weekday right when they opened and we had the whole place to ourselves. It was wonderful.  You will pay $8 for self park and one child and two adults was $64.50 for only the aquarium exhibits. I would plan one to two hours. There are many great  medium sized exhibits that are easy to navigate. The experience is much more intimate than some of the major aquariums and definitely less hassle. All ages should enjoy. I can recommend this aquarium and I will return again!\n\n",
  "I hadn\u2019t been to the Denver Aquarium in over 10 years, and went back this weekend. I think the presentation is amazing. It is really well laid out and makes it super easy to maneuver and see everything. The exhibits are great for kids and adults and allow an up close exposure to the fish and animals. ",
  "Overall this aquarium was nice with plenty of fish to see. The stingrays were so friendly and we loved interacting with them. My one year old loved seeing all the fish! The food was very good and prices were not bad.  I only gave a rating of two because of the tiger. There is no need for a tiger to be in that place, it is way too small and you could tell the tiger was stressed out. It made us very sad and I truly think it would be much better if that tiger was out of that building.",
  "Loved this aquarium. We spent half a day here and it was great. We go there right when it opened so it wasn't very busy. Many floor to ceiling viewing areas and a ton of information available. "

This museum was built at the former Lowry Air Force Base. If you\u2019re into the history of airplanes and spacecraft, this museum will tickle your fancy (pique your interest). ",
  "This museum has a good collection of mainly US military aircraft, housed in what used to be a large hanger on what used to be a military airfield.\nYou cannot miss the entrance - there is a B52 bomber outside to welcome visitors.\nMost of the exhibits are US military aircraft, I would hope that at some time in the future, a greater variety of planes are added, there is still plenty of room to fit in extra exhibits\nThere were a number of very enthusiastic volunteers who were happy to talk about some of the displays.\nI found some of the most interesting displays were not the actual aircraft but smaller and poster displays such as the poster display on some aviator heroes from the world wars, German and British as well as American. Also, there are side room displays that should not be missed, such as the Colorado Air National Guard room and the room devoted to female aviators.\nAt one end of the hanger, displays look to the future, space and drone technology. \nAs we had a young child in our party, we did enjoy the excellent small kids space with books, building blocks child play areas.",
  "Has a nice collection of planes, considerably smaller than say the Smithsonian or the National Naval Air Museum but larger than other regional air museums.  The X-Wing fighter is an amusing addition to the museum though :)  Has a good assortment of different types of aircraft and a few nice additions like flight simulators for the kids.",
