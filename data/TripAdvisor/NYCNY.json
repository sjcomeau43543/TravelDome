  "Always visit here at the holidays with out of towners, relatives and friends. Although I could give the tour by heart, much better taking the Official. More Celebratory and majestic. Plan to spend a minimum 2-3 hours to take everything in.",
  "A treasure of pictures, memorabilia, artifacts, and videos showing the event of 9/11. An awesome place on the very site of what had been the World Trade Center towers.  ",
  "The designers and architects did a wonderful job on this memorial museum.  It really tells the devastating story of that day. Would recommend getting the tickets online so you don't have to wait in line."

  "This is one of the great comprehensive museums of the world. Only the Louvre in Paris can compare in scope of art periods and movements included, as well as depth of styles and quality of the collections. ",
  "We visited the Met on a rainy day in January, on our first visit to NYC with our 2 boys, 17 and 12. We all LOVED it and still talk about. We all chose a section to see and there  was something for everyone. It is the reason we would go back to NYC again!",
  "I love the free guided tour the museum offers.  Each day they have a timetable that you can get from the information, or ticket counter.  The guides are very knowledgeable on the topics they are responsible for.  The tour is usually an hour.  \n\nIt is a huge museum, so many to see.  The ticket is good for three days.  I chose to spend about 2-3 hours each day and went back every day for different tours.  It was a wonderful experience",
  "This is truly one of the best museums in the world, I had only a couple of days touring New York but I can't miss this.  I would give myself two full days if I had the opportunity to go back again, and its very easy to get around the hall as they are clearly marked.  The Met Shop also have many interesting books and gifts, and there's even a clearance section.  \n\nWould love to go back.  Late posting, I was there during June 2018",
  "In my opinion, this is one of the two most interesting museums in New York, only because of the gigantic and wonderful collection, but also because of the architecture and general structure of this place!"

So choose a less sunny or hot day and this is a marvellous walk over the river into Manhattan.",

Lots of opportunities to take photos and buy souvenirs and ending up close to chinatown was definitely  a plus so that we could get lunch. There are benches dotted along the way to rest, so that was handy. It'll take approx 1 to 1.5 hours to walk across at a slow pace and take in the scenery. Make sure you do it. "

It's in the northern part of Manhattan but easily accessible by subway and bus, so please do go in warm weather and soak in the scenery and artwork.  The art are arranged so that people can take them in at their own pace and at an unbiased, neutral angle, and I'd say that the buildings themselves are part of the art.

The rescued buildings and architectural samples are brought together in a way that feels natural and yet allows visitors to see each one on its merits.

You have to queue, but its not so bad, once on the ferry you can choose to either sit on the ample benches or stand inside or out to take in the view - an it is amazing sailing away from NYC. You can easily see the statue, not close up, but from an okay distance so its one. Once at Staten Island, we just walked off and got on the same ferry going back to New York. Total time was about 2 hours. Well worth the trip and a sunny day definitely makes a difference.",

Make sure you get to the bottom rear of the boat so you have a beautiful view of the city as you heard toward Staten Island. It's the best view ever! Once you arrive you simply walk through the station and get in line to return to Manhattan. Easy peasy! Try and stand at the rear left hand side of the boat on the return as you'll have a great view of the Statue of Liberty. It's absolutely breathtaking! Enjoy!!!",

There was a inside area and a outdoor area, in the outside area you had a lot of planes and helicopters to see and in the interior area you had rooms, machine guns, and the cabins. Near the outside area you can see the \u201cENTERPRISE\u201d (the plane that went to the moon in a mission). When you end the visit you can go to see a submarine that went to the war a few years ago. In short there are planes that go trough the sea and there are ships that go trough the sky. ",
  "An unexpectedly fantastic museum on an aircraft carrier! Lots of planes to see. The Concorde was amazing and great to go into the flight deck. ",
  "We first visited 15 years ago, and in that time it really has changed loads. \n\nReally enjoyed the space exhibit and seeing all the aircraft on the flight deck. \n\nThought it was wrong that you had to pay more to get onto Concorde though.",
  "We bought the general admission as part of the C3. It doesn\u2019t include the VR and the 4D theater. Nice exhibits, and great for families with kids. Employees are not friendly. ",
  "On our recent trip to NYC, we booked The Intrepid 101 tour for the two military enthusiasts in our group. James was our tour guide. He was engaging, interesting, and incredibly well-educated on military history, especially WWII. James made naval enthusiasts of US ALL! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f"

  "After visiting the 9 11 memorial, we passed through the oculus on our way to the subway station located nearby.\nThe construction itself is massive, architecturally speaking very impressive and spacious, but in my opinion is a punch in the eye.\nInside there is a lot of free space and shops are here and there, I did not see a real concept (although I am sure there is).\nOverall interesting to see once, but that's about it. ",
  "The architecture and look from the inside is quite impressive; But the overall experience is not spectacular or out of this world. Very functional shopping area with paths to the metro and the PATH  ",
  "The Oculus is the architectural gem in the new World Trade Center which now includes a new tower, along with memorial museum and fountains where the original twin towers used to be. It\u2019s definitely worth seeing.",

  "This is a wonderful museum, a great insight into the fabric of the American people, and I'm sure a very emotional experience for those who have personal ties to this place. I found the museum, and whole the experience, very informative and often eye-opening as to the formation of the melting pot that is America. Seeing the large, elegant processing room, polished and sparkling, and knowing that is was once filled with people, looking for a new life...Entering the sterile dormitories where people slept in towers of bunks, like books piled on a shelf...I enjoyed the temporary exhibit on the one thing of importance people brought with them during some of the most recent conflicts, involving refugees from Afghanistan, Syria and Libya. \nI booked through State Cruises, and if I can say one thing, it would be to book the ferry from the New Jersey departure. There were so few people leaving from Liberty State Park, it made the process of going through security a breeze! Also, there is a cafeteria on Ellis Island, but there is nothing stopping you from bringing a picnic to enjoy on the grounds outside, with a knock-out view of the NYC skyline! Combined with the Statue of Liberty, plan on spending most of the day visiting here - we took a 9 am crossing, and finally return to Liberty Park around 3 pm.",
  "Stayed in New York and I can tell you this is an amazing place to find out whereabouts my predecessors  ended up in the America. From there the plan was to travel to England to find out even further where and how far back we went.\nEllis Island is good  with good security and for obvious reasons!\nWell worth taking your time for the research.",
  "We decided to visit Ellis Island by purchasing tickets through state cruises, which offered a fair deal for both the statue of liberty and Ellis Island.\nAfter visiting the first landmark, we headed by boat to Ellis Island, where millions of immigrants came upon arriving to the New world a century ago.\nThe buildings were restored and looked really stunning, the grounds are beautifully kept and there are lots of reading to do inside, movies to see and pictures to look at.\nI did not use the audio guide as I found it quite boring.\nWe spent nearly 3 hours there and could have stayed even more, then my belly was rumbling and we left for Manhattan.\nIt was inspiring reading what immigrants went through, how they lived and what they thought of this new world, we both really enjoyed our time and whenever we will visit NY again this will be one of the first attractions we want to go back to.\nSimply wonderful, touching and inspiring. ",
  "So glad we took time to see all Ellis Island had to offer. There are many exhibits, though I most enjoyed the one that took you through what it would have been like to immigrate through the island. \n\nThere\u2019s a cafe here that had a decent variety in food options and wasn\u2019t way over priced, like I thought it may be.  ",
  "As a fourth grade teacher, this was a place I have wanted to see for a long time, and it didn't disappoint.  This museum was very well done with so much history.  I would recommend Ellis Island to anyone who wants to learn more about American history.  "

As an Irish catholic the connections are strong to this Cathedral and New York, however it was very unusual to see security in the church and people walking around when mass was being said.  ",

  "A traditionally constructed building which is spectacular on the outside as well as inside. Close to the Rockefeller centre this is a must see attraction. It is such a calm and pleasant place to spend some time and relax.",
  "On our last day in NYC, we decided to walk from our hotel to St. Patrick's on a brisk winter day. The cathedral was filling up fast for the 9:00 mass, but we managed to find a pew about half way back from the altar. The choir and organ were quite nice and fill the vast space with a beautiful sound. Cardinal Dolan was saying Mass, and we found him pragmatic yet holy. In spite of the large congregation, mass was concluded in just one hour, and we had time to admire the beautiful architecture and altars in this wonderful cathedral. It's truly a New York treasure."

  "I can't begin to tell you how amazing this place is. For a start its easy to get to, just follow the crowds - and there are thousands of them - even on a school night! Its just an iconic place too. We were greeted by friendly security staff who search your bags before allowing you into the 'reception area' there are plenty of things to buy from the club shops that pop up. We went in March (to watch the basketball) and September to watch the Ice Hockey - both amazing and entertaining - who'd have thought it. Seat allocations are good, you have a reserved seat and people generally sit in their own seats, if not the plentiful ushers will help you out. Its a great venue. great atmosphere and so big. We absolutely enjoyed the games we watched there and would love to go back.",
  "We attended the Knicks and Pistons game.  I was very impressed with the inside of the arena.  It was easy to navigate and our seats were comfortable.  The food was pretty good.  We all had the chicken baskets with fries.  We were in the 400 level and had to walk far if we wanted anything other than popcorn and hotdogs.  Every stand had the same selection.  It would\u2019ve been nice if every other had something else to offer.  The lower levels for example had pizza along with the yummy chicken baskets.  At this point, I enjoyed my time there, but it was our last stop that made our evening.  We finished at a gift shop to take some Knicks items home to family.  First off, all of the staff was incredibly friendly.  They were all chatting and made us feel welcomed.  Who stood out the most was Marcus (sp), he even dribbled basketball with my son for probably 15 minutes.  He taught him better form and laughed with him.  He was patient and genuine.  He went way over and above what any employee would do.  My son couldn\u2019t stop talking about Marcus.  Additionally, we wanted some Rangers gear and the staff happily got that for us.  We will return to Madison Square a garden and are grateful for the experience that we had!!",
  "Fantastic experience and well worth a trip!! \nWe watched the Knicks play and thoroughly enjoyed it!! Great atmosphere and well worth a visit\nWe also had a couple of daily burgers which were the best burgers we\u2019ve ever eaten!! \nWell worth a trip :)",

I caught the Sunday matinee, which meant the cast was a little switched up, but all the performances where top-notch, with a special shout-out to George Salazar in the role of Michael. I came out of the theatre with the music swirling around inside of my brain, and it hasn't stopped since. A definite two thumbs-up from me for a great way to spend an evening!",
  "While who ever you ask will have their own favorite show or many,  99% of the time you cant go wrong, i personally like the big over the top musicals but the comedies are also fantastic.  I recommend buying directly from the theaters for the best pricing.",
  "Jeff was AMAZING in this show. We went specifically to see Jeff Daniels and he didn't disappoint! The rest of the cast was wonderful as well, worth the money. We have been to The Purple Rose theater in Chelsea, Jeff's theater, and always enjoy what we see there.  If you get a chance, see his one man show. He sings, tells stories, it is fantastic!!",

You just might have to wander a little, but there are plenty of spots to sit and enjoy. And snack on an apple...in the Big Apple...because you KNOW you have to do it!",
  "A short walk from our hotel, I was not expecting this. I thought it would be an actual square, but in n way shape or form were we disappointed. The lights leading down and going off towards Broadway were amazing, it was like daylight. The atmosphere was exciting and the place was bustling with tourists - late at night too. We visited a few times, during the day and at night - go both times to appreciate the sights. There are stairs leading to a sort of viewing platform, where you can take pictures galore or sit and rest. It does get very busy, but its just amazing. There are plenty of shops and restaurants close by and we saw several street performers too. Its free and fantastic so make sure you go.",

The dinosaur exhibits are huge and they were definitely busier than other areas we visited...we spent a lot of time exploring and taking pictures.  Very cool displays!\n\nThe other area we checked out was the sea life and giant whale installation.  Such a huge, cavernous space that didn\u2019t feel busy at all.  We took lots of pictures and looked at lots of displays.\n\nShe was definitely captivated for several hours and enjoyed seeing and learning new things-so that\u2019s a win in my book.  We\u2019ll definitely be back-we need to check out the other floors we didn\u2019t get to and explore the planetarium.  You should come by for a visit and lose yourself for the day.",
  "I first visited the museum 7 years ago on my first time in NY, and I remember vividly wandering around endlessly while reading as many plaques and inscriptions I could.\nFew weeks ago my girlfriend and I visited the museum as we always do in every major city we visit, as we enjoy learning something new about the past and I especially love dinosaurs.\nWe came around 3pm on a rainy day, and while I was ready to pay the full price the cashier told me I could choose how much to pay. I eventually gave 26 usd, which I think was fair for the amount of time we spent inside.\nWe tried to see as much as we could, and in fact we stayed until they told us they would close soon and we better exit the building.\nWe mostly enjoyed the historic exhibitions about countries and the dinosaurs, but in general the entire museum, although aging and in need of revamping, was very educational and it's definitely worth spending both time and money for a visit.\nI hope not to have to wait other 7 years for my next visit :) "

It's not for everyone, as it tends towards (as the name says) modern art, so if you don't like modern art, then go to the Met instead.  This museum has an exhaustive number of permanent exhibits and some famous paintings, such as Dal\u00ed's The Persistence of Memory, as well as fantastic temporary exhibits (a few years ago they had an exhibit dedicated to Tim Burton, and they also had a life artwork performance by Marina Abramovi\u00e7).
