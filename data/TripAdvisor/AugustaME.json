  "This is about as comprehensive as a state history museum can get. Four floors of Maine, and very well done. Between this and the Maine Historical Society in Portland, you have it covered. Very interesting.",
  "We wanted something to do on this rainy day. The Maine State Museum did not disappoint. Well stocked museum full of Maine's artifacts. Taxidermy was pretty incredible to see. Price was so reasonable and we stayed a couple of hours just mesmerized by everything. Highly recommend on a rainy day!",
  "The museum is right in the same building as the state library and archives. My wife and I were going to take a quick peak and ended up staying a little over two hours!  Great exhibits on Maine!",
  "Lots of interesting Maine history. Came up on a rainy day from Boothbay Harbor last fall, and it was well worth the drive.",
  "We came to Augusta to see this museum. It was amazing. We enjoyed our walk through the museum. So many wonderful things to see and so much history. We really enjoyed our visit. The museum is $3 and worth more then that!!! We will definitely take visitors there when we have them visit us. Definitely should be on everyone's bucket list to visit. So many displays!!",
  "We visited this museum on October 16. There is a garage with free parking for visitors in Sewall Street. This is a classic state museum with information about the indigenous, early settlers, industry and how the Mainers lived.\nNo modern multimedia to consult information.",
  "This museum must rank highly on your \"bucket list\".   If your are a native and you have not taken the time to visit this facility then you can not refer to yourself as an authentic Mainiac.  Maybe a little over-stated but this museum is very much worth your time.  Take your family out on a Saturday when the weather out of doors is inclement.or cold and enjoy an educational experience learning a little about the wonderful state of your residence.  The displays have been around for decades and I/we have visited only twice in my seventy-one years and it never seems to get old.  A simply wonderful place to spend an afternoon with your young children or grand-children and give them an experience they will never forget and always be reminded of you years later when they reflect on the day of.their visit.  \n\nDon't forget,you may even learn something too! DIRIGO",
  "While we visited Augusta for Fort Western, the French and Indian site that also served Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr during the Revolution.  Unfortunately, it was closed (restricted hours during off season).  At a local state office, someone suggested we try the Maine State Museum.  It was great, covering everything from rocks to women's sufferage.  My favorites were:  \n-- rocks and crystals from Oxford County\n-- (non-native) Irish Elk horns, compared to moose and elk\n-- taxidermied moose calf\n-- shell midden\n-- woman hand-packing sardine cans (she clipped heads and tails with scissors)\n-- many animal dioramas\nThis wonderful museum is suitable for both adults and children.  It is also inexpensive. As a senior, I paid $2 -- wow!"

  "Oh, if this place could talk, the stories it could tell! Impressive architecture, hallowed halls, historic art, beautiful grounds! Take a self-guided tour with the help of a pamphlet at the front service kiosk, or arrange for a free guided tour with a knowledgeable guide. Time well spent!",
  "We visited this place on October 16. There is a garage with free parking for visitors in Sewall Street. There are guided tours on the hour. We had to go with a school group. The guide was very strict with the children and we had to follow the same rules. She was not very friendly when we asked questions. If you want to take pictures you need permission of the Secretary of the House. We already visited 26 State Houses but this was the first time we had to do this.\nYou can lunch in the cafe of the State House.",
  "Very informative and we learned a lot!\nCrystal did an awesome job and allowed us to ask questions.  It is a beautiful building with amazing architecture.  There are elevators if necessary. \nThe tour was free, you will need to go through security.\nWe had lunch there, after the tour.\n",
  "Very cute, but very small. We went after hours, so I don't know what traffic may be like during the day. Lovely grounds surrounding the building. ",
  "I'm fond of this building because my grandfather was the Maine state auditor for almost 30 years. His office was next to the governor's in the round rotunda on the rear."

  "We enjoyed learning about the fort and Maine history.  Our family of 5 had our own guide and tour.Guides were dressed as in the historical time period. We had a bonus: got to taste lemonade that an educational group of children made. Thought it was a little expensive for the tour however they did have a 'deal' for a family of 5 or more; so we saved a little $. Thanks for the experience :)",
  "A great place to visit for both adults and children. They have people dressed in the time period and they answer your questions as if they where in the time. ",
  "Worth a visit if you are in Augusta. Oldest fort in the country. Any repairs are done with historians and archaeologists that ensure period accuracy. Peter was an excellent tour guide and was engaging with interesting facts of what occurred during the French and Indian war. His passion came through.",
  "Looked around, school kids being toured.\nNo one spoke to us, looked around and left.  Not much to see...",
  "This fort was built in the 1700s next to the river and it looks now like it did back then. There are lots of folks here dressed up in period clothing, including soldiers, who help show what a soldier's life was like in the camp back in the day. They give guided tours, and our tour guide was very enthusiastic. I learned a lot of interesting history on the tour through the fort grounds and inside the building, though the tour did go on a little long. There is a gift shop here, and a parking lot next to it. The place also holds a variety of activities.",
  "Tour guide was extremely knowledgeable. The history of the activity at the fort was very interesting. The antique furnishings of the actual occupants were a nice segway into the period in the 18th century. Well worth the visit. ",
  "Great place to visit! Our tour guide was so informative and had so many interesting facts/stories to share! Loved it!",
  "This historic fort is very close to downtown Augusta. We weren\u2019t able to take a tour but enjoyed seeing it from the outside. It was built in 1754, before the Declaration of Independence was written."

  "Not very interesting, not very well maintained.  The hosta trail was nice, I guess.  And the price of admission was right: $0.00.",
  "A nice day spent on a relaxing walk.  We toured the trails of the arboretum and saw some wildlife, although we had hoped to see a bit more.  It was a hot hot day, that could have been a factor.  The front office area was just as interesting as the trails.  The tiny gift shop area was cute.  We will definitely go back to explore some more as we know we only saw a fraction of what the site has to offer.",
  "My husband and I took the short walk through the arboretum.  It was nice to take an afternoon walk in the woods in the middle of Augusta, but the trails were not clearly marked, the 1 mile walk was about half that long - if we actually followed it - the signage was very poor,  only the hosta area had much to look at, and there were a only a handful of antique apple trees.  Most arboretums cannot compete with the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, but that was my basis for comparison."

I had an appointment in an office on the third floor which are a bit dreary looking since a variety of people and agencies rent offices there. If though you are attending a function it is well worth looking around the first floor.Beautiful staircase and lovely spacious make this a lovely spot for a wedding.

  "I went here for the purpose of getting a great view and photo of the capitol. But it is also a great park to explore around. Lots of eloquently lined benches. It is quiet, calm and very serene. You can explore different corners of the park to check out interesting monuments. Its worth a go if you're in the area.",
  "Even though it was below zero, still had to stop and take yet another photo.  If anyone goes there before it snows again, the lonely tracks in the snow across from the YMCA driveway are mine!  lol",

People can play soccer on the open lawns, read at the benches or picnic tables, there are tai chi classes that use this park. Just a lovely, under-appreciated gem across from the Capitol. Maine State Museum a short walk away, as well as the YMCA."

  "Originally by Bulfinch the Capitol has portraits of all Governors, Hall of Flags, House and Senate Chambers.  Free tours are very interesting and Legislators in Action (relative term) can be seen from January to June (odd numbered years) or March (even numbered years)",
  "The building was closed when we arrived so we were only able to view the building from the outside. It has a large dome, which may have been made of copper.",
  "Road trip!  Our 24th State Capitol. We arrived at 8:15 to walk around a few minutes before the first tour at 9:00. When got back to the tour desk a few minutes before 9:00 the tour person very rudely told us that she didn\u2019t have room for us because she had a bunch of school children there and all of the tours were full. We asked if we could tag along with one of the school groups (as we have done in a few other Capitols) and again she very rudely told us no. Turns out other Capitol employees already knew that this woman is less than polite to Capitol visitors based on their comments to us and even apologized for her behavior. Be prepared!\nBe sure to visit the tunnel between the Capitol and their office building to see the wildlife exhibits.",
  "Spent a day watching our legislators hard at work. Fascinating to watch the dynamics of the goings on as our leadership helps to shape the lives of the citizens of our state. Very inspiring day for the kids.",
  "First a couple tips for your visit here: 1) the entrance is at the back of the Capitol building not up the front stairs\n2) tours are on the hour 9-12 but if you miss that you may be able to arrange a shorter tour if the on the hour tour didn't take place. We did this and the guide was sooo accommodating and informative, knowledgeable, personable and funny.\n\nVery interesting to hear about how the state government functions. Quite different from many other states. It's the only state that has always had Native American Tribal representatives. All committees have representatives from the Senate as well as the House. When a vote is cast in the Senate or House you cannot leave until you have voted. And when you vote you have two choices: yes or no. There is no abstaining!\n\nAfterwards went to the gift shop for a Christmas ornament souvenir of our visit. The woman who runs the gift shop was one of the nicest people at a cash register that we have ever met.\n\nLastly, at this my 20th capitol building visit, I learned that there is a souvenir passport book that gets stamped for each capitol you visit. The great news is that in the back of the book is an address where you can request  stamps for the capitols you have visited but didn't get stamps for. Unlike the National Park Service these passports are not displayed which is very similar to the Presidential library passport (as an FYI)\n\nWorth the visit just for how lovely everyone is\ud83d\udc4d\n\n",
  "As a constituent I've been in the State House numerous times. It's a fine building and for visitors, a remarkable opportunity to see this state's convening of constituents and neighbors taking on the really massive challenge of representation. The building complex is inviting as well as historic. The grounds leading down to the river are a manageable adventure especially in the summer. Exploring the halls filled with flags and offices of state leaders is a wonderful memory for kids as well as adults. Even the food service is welcoming and unpretentious. As much as media glimpses of government are discouraging, personal explorations of this State House has been inspiring."

Our grandchildren ages 3 and 1 absolutely loved this place and on a rainy day it was great fun.",

It's not a very big space, but my understanding is that they want to grow it. Non the less they have a lot of displays that are all hands on for the kids. Thanks for having us!",
  "Worst place I've ever been too!\nThey have a rude teenager at the door no management on duty. Kids were left unsupervised with no adults because of the outrageous $6 per person fee!\nI don't mind paying for my children but to expect a full fee per parent and an 18 yr old sibling is a bit much. We drove 45 mins to spend a couple of hours with our 5 year old and had to leave with him in tears. It could have been an easy fix but like I mentioned before a rude teenager on duty and no management.\nDon't waste your time this is not a fun or professional environment.",

We used our reciprocal museum membership which gave us 50% off admission. That made this a bargain! New exhibit of topographical sand map was really cool. Nice craft area for stickers, painting, stamps. Would suggest they add a sink in that area for cleanup. \nVerdict: great way to fill a chunk of afternoon in the winter. I am sure we will be back!",
  "I took my son here who was 12 at the time, even though this place is meant for children much younger my son presents himself much younger than he is, he did enjoy almost every aspect of the museum from the big bulldozer to the art station I would highly recommend this place to anyone with kids!

After stopping at the Maine Jewish Museum and purchasing a book, we noticed the Holocaust Center mentioned on the cover. It was a great find! So a few days later we came back through Augusta, and this time we stopped. We're so glad we did! The exhibit is small, but very nicely done. Be sure to check out the 11 minute video and the rotating art exhibit. The gentleman on staff there is incredibly nice and knowledgeable, and you can tell that he's passionate about the information they're presenting. \n\nThis little center will take up less than an hour of your day (likely closer to 30 minutes), but might well be the best thing you see in Augusta."

  "This outside mall is broken up into 3 tiers, A lower, middle and top. For folks that have never shopped there before, it's a bit confusing to navigate or find the specific stores your looking for. You must drive to each tier. "

  "I would have to say that I have mixed feelings about this set of trails.  We cross-country skied and were disappointed at the way that the trails were marked.  We have hiked as well and found the trail markings to be a bit confusing.  On a positive note, the trails were fairly easy to hike and some were wide. Most of the trails seemed to be tended.  If you want to geocache, there are a few of them on the trails.",
  "Nice for mountain biking, less for walking. I have tried to cross Country ski here in the Winter and find the trail poor. if you like a bike challenge try it otherwise save yourself a trip."
