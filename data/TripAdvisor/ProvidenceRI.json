   "Visited the Zoo on a unseasonably warm day in February. It was very nice especially for a 4 and 6 year old, they loved it. The displays and zoo overall was very well kept and clean. We will definitely visit again.",
   "We love Roger William's Zoo! They have all the \" typical\" animals you find in a zoo. There are lots of things to do. It's a great place for people of all ages. They rent strollers, wheelchairs and electric scooters if you are in need of them. Employees in the park are so nice and helpful. They have typical fast food so if you want a nutritious lunch I suggest you bring a packed lunch. It's a great place to spend the day!!!",
   "We visited on a rainy winter day and we may have been the only people there. This zoo is lovely. We understood that with the rain we wouldn\u2019t see all the animals. But we got to see many of them since multiple enclosures included an indoor viewing area in addition to the outdoor area. We even saw some animals that we haven\u2019t seen in any other zoo yet. I can definitely see this place getting crowded in the summer or during special events. ",
   "We visit this zoo in the evening ever October for their annual Jack-O-Lantern display, a very special night, walkthrough the zoo and view lit up artwork on pumpkins, there is music in each section, concession stands with great snack before entering the path, brought my mom in a wheelchair, it\u2019s is a concrete/gravel path.  Excellent Autumn event to attend, close park near by to visit in the daytime has Swan boats, a carousel and just gorgeous Mother Nature at her finest for Fall foliage!",

   "We had a wonderful visit to the museum on a rainy Tuesday. Like other reviews have noted there are so many periods and mediums to enjoy.  From classic statues to modern installations of multi-media.  This week we were lucky enough to catch the remix of the classic \"Raid the Icebox Exhibit\" by Andy Warhol.  The museum has a wonderful flow from room to room and it's so easy to get lost in the variety of art. To see art from the The Hudson River School, Pollock, O\u2019Keeffe, Picasso, Gauguin, furniture, ceramics, Frank Lloyd Wright, glass work, tapestries, furniture and so much more was a real treat. There is a sense of whimsy and innovation around every corner - like the current Disco of artwork!  It's a wonderful sampling to expose your family to.  It's the right size that it will not feel like they are trudging on and on.  2 - 3 hours should do it easily.  If you have time, stroll up the hill to visit the campuses of RISD and Brown.  You'll want to go back to college.  \n\nOne tip:  Parking is extremely limited.  If you can walk, take an Uber or bus there you'll be better off.",
   "The RISD Museum is filled with items made by students and faculty and the exhibits change so you will always see something new and engaging.",
   "Very varied  and interesting collection including Monet, Picasso , Renoir and an Egyptian Mummy As well as architecture . Very worth while.",
   "Fine museum with something for everyone of every age! Wonderful paintings both contemporary and traditional, a huge carved buddah, a mummy and sarcophogus, Japanese swords, and too many more wonderful things to mention. Do not miss!",
   "RISD Museum of Art was bigger than I expected. The Gorham exhibit was fascinating and informative. The \"Raid the Icebox 2\" exhibits were terrific. A re-do from 50 years ago when RISD invited Andy Warhol to raid the icebox (storage) and create an exhibit, this year RISD invited 10 current artists to do the same. So fun to see the unique ways  to show the artwork."

   "Lots of good food. This area was entirely Italian until about 15 years ago and has a number of excellent established Italian restaurants at a variety of price points. More recently it has acquired Mexican, Indian and several other sorts of restaurants. In addition, it has lots of pleasant atmosphere, including parades and street festivals, as well as authentic grocery stores and bakeries in which to purchase a variety of raw and prepared delicious Italian foods.",
   "Federal Hill is full of Italian Restaurants. In the summer you see a lot of people walking up and down Atwells Ave. There are so many restaurants to choose from, shops to visit or you can just sit on the square and enjoy the fountain. There is a little park that has checker/chess boards painted on the tables if you're interested in playing. You always see older Italian men sitting across from the square reminiscing & drinking coffee or smoking cigars. Along with a bunch of restaurants to choose from there are cigar bars if that's what you're craving. There are bakeries, steakhouses, Chinese food, hair salons, nail salons and places you can have your Tarot Cards read. If you are the dancing type come at night and you'll find a lot of Dance Clubs that are open until 2 in the morning. Back in the day there were Mafia all over the Hill but it's not like that today. There were even \"hits\" that made the front page of the Providence Journal Bulletin. Today it's a foodie's dream. ",
   "Have eaten at several Federal Hill places but have found equally good restaurants, outside the area, at more reasonable prices.  Yes, it has charm but so do many others.  However, if you want to experience an outstanding dessert place there, go to Pastiche. As people say, \"Their desserts are to die for! \"",
   "Federal Hill is Providence's version of a \"Little Italy\" in other cities. Given that Providence is a renowned restaurant city, one would expect the restaurants on Federal Hill to be excellent.\n\nOne would be correct.\n\nMy favorite is Massimo, on Atwells Ave., but I have never had anything less than a fine meal at any of the restaurants I have visited on the Hill. There is also Mexican and Chinese, by the way. There are also wonderful provisioners, like Venda Ravioli (MUCH more than ravioli!). Add some nice little parks, and you have the makings of a fun day trip for walking, lunch and provisions, or destination dining for dinner.",

   "A nice and beautiful state house. The security was so good that he allowed me to come in even though it was already after office hours. It was a beautiful inside and out. There were a lot of memorabilia on display. The dome inside is beautiful."

   "We visited in November and were still very  impressed with the beauty of this park. We can only imagine how wonderful this place is when \"in season\". The park has numerous walking paths and hiking \"trails\". It is spread out over a large area and is extremely well maintained. When you are in this park, you are actually in the heart of Providence, RI but you in no way get that feeling. As you experience the outer perimeter of the park you think... \"how lucky would I be to live in one of those homes?\", as there are neighborhoods that abut the park. Unless you notice that, you would never know you are that close to civilization. This park is a hidden gem!",

   "PPAC (Providence Performing Arts Center) is a beautiful place to see a show. There is a parking garage right across the street and plenty of places near by to eat before the show. One place to eat, right around the corner that I would recommend is Bravo. PPAC is beautiful inside. It's the place in Providence to see off Broadway shows and shows that were on Broadway. We've seen Annie, Godspell, Stomp, Blue Man Group, Mrs. Robinson and the Nutcracker. Too many to name. The inside of the theater is beautiful and the people who work there are extremely nice. I would highly recommend the PPAC if you want to see a show in Providence.",
   "The PPAC is full of history and tradition.  This building is your classic theatre with high beautiful ceilings.  I have season tickets so have been to many shows.  Some are terrific others not so much but always an enjoyable night.  There really isn\u2019t a bad seat, even second balcony while a little far away is great.  The seats are a little small unless you are in the lodge.  Over the last few years they started allowing food and beverages in the seating area.   Would recommend this for anything from a first date to a 50th wedding anniversary.",
   "Over the years we have seen some wonderful productions at PPAC.  Among our favorites: Les Miserables, Jersey Boys, Miss Saigon, Phantom of the Opera, Book of Mormon and so many more.  We have never been disappointed!"

The water room is on the first floor and is his favorite, but we always save it for last because he usually gets wet. Even with the smock on, water can run down his arms onto his shirt, and also he can get his shoes wet. Bring a full change of clothing so your little one can leave dry. Bring some rain boots to wear to keep feet dry. There is a parking lot that gets full on busy days but you can always find a parking spot at a meter within 1-2 blocks of the building. There\u2019s a lunch room to eat and drink (bring your own) and numerous rest rooms with changing tables on the two floors. Your child will have a good time here! ",

   "We love coming here almost as much as the kids.  The water activity room is awesome, but be careful you will ultimately get a little wet....if your child is younger or messy suggest bringing a change of clothing just in case. Bathrooms on each floor with stools for the kids ( also great if your little one is potty training). Themed rooms and pretend play.  The staff does a good job to keep the areas organized.  Some of the rooms like the Boat are very cramped so when your child runs in to play it can be hard to keep your eye on them at all times. The museum also had a great area for snacks and lunch which is kept clean. They do not serve food.  Storage area for coats and diaper bags ( free)."

Small in size, but large enough to get a bite to eat or something to drink, and to sit and relax while waiting for the train.  Rental car services are not available right at the station; however, call Enterprise in downtown Providence to reserve a car ahead of time. Someone from Enterprise will pick you up when you call them upon arrival, and also take you back to the train station after you return your car. Works out pretty well!"

   "While it admittedly feels a bit strange to be reviewing a cemetery, I felt that it truly deserved a mention as a gorgeous place to enjoy either a peaceful walk, drive, or meditation spot. The area was impeccably well-kept, even when I visited in the winter, and I can only imagine how beautiful it must be in the spring when all the plants are green and blooming. \n\nThe cemetery itself is mostly historic, and if you have time to explore you can find the graves and monuments of famous Rhode Islanders, such as the writer H.P. Lovecraft. If you meander to the far back, you can overlook the water and enjoy the view and stillness. \n\nThe only caution I would give is that it can be a bit maze-like, so be sure to remember where you are going or download a map (I found one online) unless you are blessed with a great sense of direction!",
   "A tree museum and a cemetery - it is a beautiful place to walk.  If you can be there when the trees bloom in the Spring you are in for an added treat.",
   "We visited this place on October 2. In the office building you can get a map and a booklet with the principal monuments and graves. There are several bronze monuments.",
   "I use Trip Advisor for everything and now I can add advanced planning to my list. Unfortunately we lost two very special friends this past year and both are buried here. I have also been there to visit these loved ones graves to pay respect. Not sure how to explain it, but there is this serene and peaceful feeling every time I have been there. It is a 200 acre park like cemetery. \n\nWe made plans to visit with Linda and learned so much from her. My husband and I were both pleased that we chose our final resting place. We also met the Foreman of the Cemetery Jim who was so pleasant and kind. There is so much history here and let's face, we are all going to need a final resting place. My husband and I both felt at peace with our decision and the grounds, trees, and entire landscape are meticulously cared for. \n\nIt is a beautiful place to walk and enjoy the grounds! There are lots of birds and we even saw a flock of turkeys walking around.",
   "Beautiful 300 acre cemetery. Walking around you can tell that a lot of care goes into this place daily. The trees are beautiful and there is an area along the water that is peaceful. "

   "The Benefit Street tour starts from the John Brown Museum. You have to book advance and it is a great way to find your way around the historic sites of Providence. Geographically, the tour covers a distance from about the middle of Benefit Street down to the northern end of the street; and historically it roams from the earliest settlers right up to the modern day. The history of Brown University, and the mega rich Brown family who set it up, are inevitably a big part of the story. The family patriarch John Brown features prominently and our guide didn\u2019t shy away from Brown\u2019s less than proud history of slave ownership. There\u2019s also a visit to the Providence Athanaeum, site of some Edgar Allan Poe scandal, and a tour of the First Baptist Church of America, which looks exactly as you would hope a New England church to look. The tour does take a very long time and our teenager was getting a bit fed up at the end, but it was interesting and we learned a lot.",
   "Recently,I visited the John Brown House.My visit was a fruitful experience.The guide at this house museum was very well-versed in Rhode Island History.I learned about the life of John Brown,a very prominent figure in the history and growth of Providence.I saw the house's shadow rail staircases.I saw some nice American paintings by Robert Feke,Alvan Fisher(\"View of Providence From The Cove\")and Henry Kinney(\"Moses Brown\").",
   "If you are in Providence this is a must see if you want to get an understanding of local history and the movers and shakers during colonial times and the early years of the republic. The Brown family has obvious ties to Brown University. A tour of the Historic home will last about 1-2 hours; it makes sense to take the guided tour to get a better appreciation for the home and history of the Brown family. One of the interesting things which the tour guides do not shy away from is the fact that the Brown family did have ties to the Atlantic Slave Trade. They cover the complexities of this very controversial time in history. If in Providence I really believe this should be a stop you make. Well worth the price of admission.",
   "I was in Providence on a business trip and only had a few hours of spare time. I chose to visit this gorgeous historical house and made my stay worthwhile. You can listen to an audio, read a brochure or have a guide walk you through the details of this magnificent house. George Washington supposedly stayed there and gave it a five-star rating. The best thin is that it only cost me $10.",
   "This house has a lot of history, If you have about an hour take the audio tour\nmoderately priced and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable"

   "I love going shopping and eating one Thayer St.. There are just so many great small shops and restaurants that cater to every age group. Lots of course for the college age kids as Brown University is in their backyard so to speak. and within just a mile or so from other private schools and colleges.However the adults from all over the State know it is a hub for nice clothes and good food. You can get just about anything on this strip from a bagel to a high end meal. From a pair of socks to custom made suits.Low prices,High prices. Remember,not all the kids have a rich dad or mom..Most of these kids are one thing and that is for the most part, very,very,smart.You do not get into Brown unless you are  smart.and the private schools and other colleges in the area tend to get the smart ones as well. This street is smart,it caters to every person who comes here.and it does it just so well. It is a fun place and you will just have a good time and get some great items as well.\nThe food is really good quality or it will not last here.So,Thayer st.calls to you. bring your whole family. They will love it here.",
   "Some of the best Greek food I have ever experienced.  Finding parking is a very big problem especially when Brown and RISD are in session but still worth it.",
   "Awesome street filled with shops and restaurant. Definitely check this street out if your in Providence looking at schools. The perfect street for college kids to gather, eat, etc. the Brown University Book Store is in Thayer Street. The best place to go grab a bite to eat while exploring the beautiful campuses of RSID and Brown. Everything from Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Shake Shake, Chipotle, pizza, pita, smoothies, fro yo, Starbucks. I know my kid would have plenty to choose from while in college here. ",
   "Super hungry recently and spotted the Chipotle from the corner of my eye. Went in and the vibe in this place is great. The line moves ridiculously fast and the food was amazing. I had a chicken bowl with brown rice and black beans and a side of their house made vinaigrette and left super satisfied and craving more menu options. Will definitely be back",
   "Thayer has a bit of everything including a wide assortment of restaurants which serve food from a wide variety of nations.  Andreas (Greek) is especially good.  But, many of the little hole in the wall cafes serve very good food. Very international.  Lots of shops with funky and avant guard objects to buy.  Parking can be a little dicey depending on the time of day and it is metered.  A great place to stroll and share a meal."

Spring and Fall weddings are perfect for this venue, but those dates go quickly. The staff is really great too.\n\nIf you are like me, because the greenhouses are so wonderful, it is a perfect location for a wedding celebration.",

   "Why go to Boston and literally pay 10x more for tickets for an event when you have this option?  If you have young (or older!) children who want to see quality live ice hockey, spend $38/ticket instead of the $400 in Boston.  Great restaurants, quality hotels within walking distance, reasonable parking make this a no brainer.  Providence Bruins hockey (AHL) is good, fast paced hockey.  A 24 oz can of beer cost $13 for reference.  We sat in the 6th row behind tunnel for the player for $38.  What a deal.  Marriott offers two hotels within walking distance for about $200/night, parking $30/night at the hotel (cheaper in some of the parking garages) and you can walk to Federal Hill for an outstanding Italian meal in 5-7 minutes before or after the game.  Also a couple of nice pubs outside the venue where you can actually get a seat after the game and sit and talk with a drink (we went to Murphys) - but head right over there because there will be a crowd if you wait too long.  Also college hockey, basketball, Globetrotters, concerts.  If you can't already tell, I am a huge fan of this venue!!!",

My biggest gripe is the outrageous prices charged for concessions. \nSoda $6.25\nBottle of water $5.00\nSmall popcorn $9.00\nCan of Beer $13.00\nAnd so on and so on. \n\nThere must be a point where it is considered price gouging. \n\nGonna have to wait till I hit the lottery in order to go to another event at this venue\n\n",

The venue seats around 12,000; we sat in section 230. Aside from a giant, annoying piece of equipment hanging from ceiling and blocking view of center of screen, we felt close to the stage. This size venue was great for an artist like Mayer. The concession areas were mobbed and lines frustratingly  blocked walking paths. I\u2019ve never seen so much beer for sale in my life. The DD stands sold only coffee and hot chocolate. Concession food looked unappetizing. The fried dough stand sold a decent-tasting snack. Providence is a small, easily navigable city. I\u2019d return to this venue despite the few minor annoyances. Close to Federal Hill for a good meal. ",
