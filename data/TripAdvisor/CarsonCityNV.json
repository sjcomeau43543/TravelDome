  "We spent most of the morning learning about mining, mining towns and minerals, native americans, minting coins, native plants and animals and many other subjects. Very well done!",
  "Great coverage of Nevada's history of native Americans, mining, early settlers, and minting of gold and silver coins. Extensive rock and mineral exhibits showing raw gold and silver ore. Plus exhibits of pioneer life style and hardships they faced settling in the area. You are able to walk through the original mint and view a working coin press, and an extensive display of examples of silver and gold dollar coins from about 1850 to early 1900s. Children and adults will enjoy walking through a life like underground gold mine.   Open 8:30 am - 4:30 pm, Tuesday through Sunday. Adults $8, under 17 free.",
  "We stopped here because of all the great reviews I had read about the museum. And they were right. Admission is $8 and parking is free.  The first floor has a small section on Native American heritage.  At the other end is a wonderful ghost town where you can listen to an old miner retelling its history, and then walk through to the mint and coin press. On the second floor there are geology and animal exhibits and a section on Nevada history. Our favorite part was the mine exhibit in the basement. It was very interesting to explore the mine shaft and learn about the variety of jobs the miners had. And how much timber it took to build the shafts and keep them shored up. This museum may be small but it contains a lot of Nevada history and it is very well done.",
  "We went on a Saturday when the original coin mint was operating. A silver commemorative coin, pressed on the machine first used in the 1800s, was available for sale...a great memento. The docents operating the mint were informative and the rest of the exhibits were well presented and extensive. There is an elevator for use between floors for those preferring not to take the stairs.",
  "I'm not a museum type visiting person, but my wife and I stopped by there and spent and enjoyable couple of hours..clean, interesting and run by nice people.  Don't drive by if you are in Carson City without a stop...you will enjoy the eperience.",
  "If you are really looking for a museum that shows Nevada, then this is it.  Yes, the building looks small, but inside it has multiple floors (including a basement) that has a walkthrough mine.  The old west town is themed perfectly and gives you chills as you see some of the artifacts from the wild west.\n\nThis museum also presses real silver (and sometimes gold) coins from the original Carson City mint press here (check the schedule).  I wasn't expecting much of this museum, but was quite surprised at how much they really packed in here.  Definitely worth going at least once...",
  "We spent most of the morning learning about mining, mining towns and minerals, native americans, minting coins, native plants and animals and many other subjects. Very well done!",
  "Well run museum with a dedicated staff and volunteers.  We enjoyed the wide range of displays, especially the coin area with its unique coin press.  Someone from California recommended the museum so we made a point of going to Carson City to see it instead of just driving through the town on our way someplace else.  We highly recommend a visit there.",
  "Hadn\u2019t been there in a few years. We had family in from California and took them there. There were a lot of new exhibits along with some of the favorites we had seen before. We had such a good time and our family really enjoyed it.",
  "Although we live in Carson City, it's been over 20 years since we last visited the museum and it has changed a lot --- and for the better. I decided to take my two younger granddaughters there for a short learning experience as at their age two hours is long enough for anything like this. We got into the building just before a guided tour of the mint itself and it was most interesting. We learned how hot it was to work in there in the 1800's with no air conditioning, outside air temperature around 100 degrees, as steam engine for electricity and the hot furnaces to work the metals. We learned how the coins were pressed and then the weighing process to assure each coin was the exact weight. Those to light were sent back to be reprocessed and those to heavy were trimmed by the women who worked their. Interesting also was the fact that their uniforms were burned periodically to recover the gold and silver dust that had accumulated in the cloth. During the restrengthing of the building after an earthquake, an exact model of a gold mine tunnel was constructed in the basement. By then we only had a few minutes to look at some of the Paiute Indian exhibit but did enjoy some of their basket work and a 1903 photograph of a family and their shelter. Looking forward to our next visit and learning more.",
  "Best bang for the buck.  good for both kids and adults.  small, but very informative and well designed."

  "The Museum has a wonderful selection of historic RR artifacts including steam locomotives Dayton,Inyo and #25, McKeen and Edwards motorcars and Coach 17 from the \u201cGolden Spike\u201d ceremony at Promontory Summit in Utah as well as several other rolling stock pieces. On selected days kids and adults alike can get up close and take a short ride on one of the authentic trains. It is a wonderful place with a friendly staff who welcome questions and love to discuss the museum pieces. Ask about the locomotive with no brakes!",
  "Became a member and  when I visit my Grands I take them on a train ride and into the Museum to look at the trains...",
  "The Nevada State Railroad Museum has several old steam locomotives and rail cars on display as well as many other railroad items of interest.  ",
  "We've been to several railroad museums, and none of them seem to disappoint.  This one, however, might top all of the others due to its historical values.  \n\nWe arrived when they opened at 9am, and were promptly greeted.  Upon entering one of the docents spoke with us for about 15-20 minutes.  Most of the trains on the grounds had been used by Paramount in a lot of movies.  I think the most notable was the Inyo #22 engine that was used mainly by John Wayne.  Another thing that was very neat to see was the actual rail car that carried the golden spike for the first transcontinental railroad May 10, 1869.\n\nOut back there is another building that housed numerous other engines and cars.  This is definitely a must see, even if you don't like trains too much.  Most of the visit is self guided, but there are docents there to give you a history of everything in the museum.",
  "Our trip to the NSRM was wonderful. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The grounds were impeccable and the displays were awesome. We'll definitely visit again.",
  "We decided to take our three grandsons for a day outing and could not have had a better time.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and willing to talk to everyone.  The only disappointing part was we visited during the week and there were no train rides available; however, we plan to go back because the boys want \"a train ride\".",
  "Lynn and I and friends recently spent a couple of hours at the Nevada State Railroad Museum. The West is popular for numerous railroad museums and this one is one of the best. There are 3 steam engines under one roof.   They are in meticulous condition. As a matter of fact while we were there one of the volunteers was lovingly polishing the brass. There is an opportunity for a short ride on one of the unique trains as well. There are maps of rail routes on the floor that are quite interesting. Additionally there is a station and a large garage building housing even more trains that are in various stages of restoration...and an outside boneyard of derelict train cars awaiting restoration. The volunteers appear to be rail junkies and are quite knowledgeable. This museum was a favorite stop on this trip. Admission for adults was $8.00 which seems to be a favorite admission price for Nevada State run museums. ",
  "For train buffs, this is a very nice collection of several steam engines, touring cars, turning table, and even a working handcar that four people can operate to get the feeling of the rails. The museum contains collections of scaled model trains complete with an engine and assorted cars. The museum store has various memorabilia for visitors to consider. Rides to Gold Hill and Virginia City are also available. A lar.ge tour group was easily accommodated. Docents are on site. Be sure to bring your camera."

  "This is a tiny cafeteria with a minimal, but inexpensive menu. Food isn't wonderful and atmosphere is different, being inside the building where the state legislators meet, so that makes it worthwhile. ",
  "A fun place to visit. It's great that our government buildings are so accessible. The museum inside is rich in history and interesting exhibits",
  "Like most Capital Buildings Nevada's is no different, it is a work of art. The museum on the second floor tells the history of Nevada and all its struggles through the years.\nWell worth seeing."

They also have BBQ facilities for cooking.  And the mansion is fun to tour, built with Comstock silver money.  Situated in Washoe Valley it is away from city life, quiet, and great views.  They also have concerts in the summer that are well worth the visit.  Go and relax, very safe, and well maintained.  A can't miss.",
  "Weekend tour of an extremely-well-preserved mansion with both a joyous and tragic, storied past, beginning in the 1850s. Silver riches built the mansion and when the mine played out, Sandy and Eilley Bowers became poor as quickly as they became rich. Subsequent owners wanted to turn its grounds and pools into a public park. With a $1 down payment, civic-minded Reno women raised $25,000 to save the estate. Washoe County paid the remaining $75,000 and the mansion and grounds became a regional park. The mansion tour, summer swimming, picnicking, and stellar views from the hillside grave site are well worth the detour.",

  "Great place. Walk the buildings and downtown for eats and drinks. So many things to see and do in the city. Walking /biking is the best",
  "We spent a couple of hours walking around the streets, following the map from the visitor centre. The map gave a trail to follow to view the homes and it provided information such as when the house was built and who lived there.  you will see the house where John Wayne shot his last film. And Samuel Clemens brother's house - Samuel Clemens did stay there.  You can shorten your walk if you wish - we could have spent longer enjoying these quiet streets.  My mother is restricted with mobility so she followed in the car, making stops to get out on occasion.  The streets are quiet, tree lined with many manicured gardens.  Well worth your time - and at no cost. ",
  "You follow the blue line (faded in some areas) around several blocks in the historic section of Carson City. It's a great way to kill time, or if you're a history buff to check out the building and homes, many being restored.",
  "It was a lovely day and we enjoyed our walk through the city following the blue line. \nIt leads to historic residences and government businesses. Lots of info at each stop by reading a brochure or listening to a phone app. \nIt took about 2 hours.  ( I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s called Kit Carson. Maybe the folks at the visitors bureau can answer that when you stop in to get the map)",
  "After visiting the Nevada State Capitol building, we headed out for a walk along this trail.  We used the Carson City app to help us, but once we got started near the State Museum, it was easy to follow the painted blue line throughout the neighborhood.  The app provided interesting narrative about numerous historic structures, and the trail passes by the Governor's Mansion.  Good weather made for an enjoyable tour."

  "An easy hike down a dirt road brings you to Skunk Harbor, a beautiful cove on Lake Tahoe.  This is a scenic trail with views of the lake all the way down.  The beach includes a gentle sandy section and areas with boulders for scampering or resting atop.  There are views of blue and green water all the way across the lake.  It's all gorgeous.  \n\nI made the trip very early on a weekday yet still did not have the place to myself -- boaters and hikers had camped out here the night before.  As they were still asleep, I had some time for peaceful enjoyment of the cove.  Traffic picked up by 9 a.m., with many more hikers and even daycare groups making the trek to the beach.\n\nThe paved parking areas are very small, accommodating maybe 10 cars total. They come up suddenly -- I don't remember seeing signs for Skunk Harbor or parking, but I might have missed them.   Traffic can be heavy, so be careful if you're pulling into the parking area or walking along the highway.  No restrooms or water available at either end of the trail, and you'll need to take your trash back with you.",

  "Its best to visit in the morning before the noisy boaters and the rest of the hikers start to trickle in. Vivid green and blue harbor that's hidden away enough for quiet reflection but not too far to hike, a rarity for any natural beauty. The hike is from the main road and will only take 30 minutes as its all downhill, a bit more of challenge on the way back up. While not a difficult hike it would be challenging for those out of shape at the elevation. The old building is interesting but no facilities for RR or fresh water. Be sure to bring plenty of your own.",
  "The beach and old pavilion/party house are great and can keep you entertained for a few hours at least. It's relatively quiet in October when we've been; 2 times in 5 years. It's a great view and you can see cool critters and plants at the beach and during the hike. Hardest part is the parking, as there's little of it and one pull off requires walking along the road for a bit. The hike out is definitely the workout part of the hike with a pretty good gain in elevation. The trail is easy as it's mostly a sand/granite forest road.",
  "This hike was in the difficult side, because of the way back up to the road (steep incline), and as an east coaster - the elevation made it even more difficult. Saying that - I can\u2019t wait to go back. The view and water was amazing. The hike and beach at the bottom was just about the most relaxing place I\u2019ve been to.",
  "We are always on the lookout for hikes with our dog and dog friendly beaches at Lake Tahoe. Skunk Harbor was a great find as it combines both! As others have noted, parking is sparse so unless you go early in the morning, I would recommend heading there later in the afternoon when people are leaving. We were lucky to snag a spot yesterday afternoon near the green gate and headed with our dog down to the harbor. \n\nThe hike down is fairly easy - you just need to take care when attempting the steep shortcuts to not slip. I tend to like hikes with rewards at the end and this one has one of the best! Skunk Harbor is absolutely stunning! I love the craggy rocks, the nooks and crannies to climb and explore. You can find lots of different sandy areas or bigger boulders to camp out on for the day. \n\nIt is also interesting to walk around the former summer party home built in the 1920's for a wealthy California family. You can almost imagine what it would have been like to be there during the Roaring Twenties- with music, food and laughter in this beautiful spot! \n\nIf you take the shortcuts back up instead of the main trail, be prepared for a bit of a workout! It can be rather steep!",
  "Park on the side of Highway 28 by the green gate. Pack a picnic lunch and head down the trail to the lake for gorgeous views and crystal clear water. When you get to the lake, keep walking around to the right and find a spot on the rocks to enjoy the views. We had fun jumping off the rocks into the water. Save some energy for the hike back up the trail.",

It was something our 88 year old mom could safely enjoy.  The statues were interesting and the grounds well kept.  This is a very inviting capitol.",
  "The Capitol Building in Carson City is home to the Nevada State Legislature. Visiting is very informal and you can just wander around or join a free guided tour. There was no intrusive security screening unlike in most government buildings of the USA I am sure.\nThere are some interesting displays on various aspects of Nevada State history.\nThe helpful gentleman at the front desk even stamped our Route 50 Passport with a Nevada state stamp.\nCertainly worth a look around.",
  "We walked to the Capitol Complex after it had closed,  but thoroughly enjoyed walking around the building.  The grounds are beautifully kept and we enjoyed the signs identifying the different kinds of trees there. The capitol building is beautiful from the outside."

  "We ate at Sassafras next door and decided to come over to Shoe Tree Brewing for a few beers after dinner.  We have eaten at sassafras before  and commented that we needed to go to  Shoe Tree Brewing but before this have yet to visit.\n\nWe were impressed - the interior was decorated cute and it was comfortable. Shaun was helpful in explaining the options and my wife was happy to learn they make their own root beer.\n\nI also liked the fact that they offer both a double and triple IPA. They have board games and even old school video games!  Their swag is nice as well and reasonably priced - cool logo too.\n\nI even had a couple of growlers filled to take with me to enjoy later. Great experience - we will be back!",
  "Visited as part of our tour of North American breweries and this was well worth the trip. A good selection of beers to suit all tastes with video and board games to entertain children. Bar tender was super friendly and knew all about the beers and allowed us to try before choosing which ones to go for. Atmosphere very relaxed and a good mix of customers so this will suit all tastes, I have no doubt and would highly recommend. Prices also very reasonable. Top brewery!",
  "Well this place looks the part, a sweet little building in a car park opens up to a well designed, good looking bar. Excellent typography on the walls, beautiful wood tables. There was a Nintendo 64 set up that my daughter enjoyed playing along with some board games provided.  She drank a sparkling lime and mango drink which was delicious.\nWe generally try the flights but went for 4 halves instead. The beer was good, I particularly enjoyed the vanilla cream on nitro and the Brunswick blonde ale. Mr G enjoyed the ash canyon Amber and the shoe horn although at 9.2% a half was enough.\nWell recommend a visit. Sadly we got here just before a load of potty mouthed workers so our peace was disrupted. However we know a bar is an adult place it just pit a bit of a dampener on the visit.\nThe bar man was friendly.",
  "Every time I visit friends in Carson, I make it a point to drop the Shoe Tree Brewery.  Many many choices of brews...I had a vanilla beer on nitro and it was excellent.  Beertender was really nice and all the locals were cool.  Looking forward to my next visit.",
  "Got to visit a few times during my extended stay and each time I was wowed by their beer. And the homemade rootbeer!! Yum! It's the perfect place to pull up a stool, tuck into a flight and meet some new friends. A little off the beaten path from downtown but so worth it! Make a day of it by going  the hot springs and getting a great lunch at the restaurant both of which share the same parking lot.."

Pretty little waterfall In an unlikely place. Read the info boards. I was surprised to see it\u2019s one of the main suppliers of water for the area. ",

  "Great easy fun hike. Was surprised to know there was a water fall in Carson. It\u2019s pretty and a nice surprise. Going to the top next time. Great day",
  "Easy to find, and not crowded. We only did the hike to the first falls and it was beautiful. Really it was a pretty short hike for a great pay-off. I would wear shoes you can get wet as you really want to get in the water to see the lower falls well, however the trail is difficult enough that you need something substantial on your feet (not flip flops)",
  "The hike to the lower Kings Canyon Waterfall is moderate with beautiful views. You go up in elevation quickly and the trail is narrow in some spots but the end result of reaching the bottom of the falls is worth it. It is only a 5 minute drive from downtown Carson City and then a short hike (1/2 hour one way) to the lower falls. The trailhead is well marked and be sure to bring a camera as you will get some spectacular shots of Carson City and the mountains. There is a longer hike that will take you to the top of the falls."

  "First time visiting the fabulous Carson Nugget. I guess the best way to describe it is \"dated\"...\nDoesn't look like much has been done to the Nugget in the last 20+ years. The exterior is gaudy at best, but nothing really to entice someone to come inside. Parking was scattered and a pain to negotiate.\nInside was as if you took a time machine back to the 1970's. I think there were chairs that were older than me there...\nThe staff looked pretty tired and definitely not happy. A few conversations with them revealed what I expected, the new-ish owners are just milking the place, pay is down, benefits are disheartening. Sad to see that. With a little effort it could be a cool place. The atmosphere (lack of oxygen) was disconcerting, it just smelled \"old\".\nThe sports bar, for a Friday night, was deserted. Actually, the entire casino was pretty dead...oh well...it was definitely a trip into the the past, albeit, not a good one...",
  "My husband and I were heading home to the Midwest from a California vacation and decided to stop for a little gambling at the Nugget since there is a Nugget in Las Vegas. The machines were kind to me and we saw a celebrity. My hubby and I both noticed, at the same time, an older black gentleman sitting at a machine. It was Charlie Pride. I told him I saw on a billboard that he was  performing nearby and he said yes, right here. So the next night he was doing a show at the Nugget. What a sweet, shy man. We talked about my favorite song of his which he said was his Number 1 hit \u2018Kiss an Angel Good Morning\u2019 . What a Great forever memory.",
  "Old School Casino - was a bit smoky \nVery friendly staff.    Great place to pop in and see if you are in area.",
  "I was attracted to the Carson Nugget because of it's central location. Once inside I was surprised to see live Keno, which I enjoy playing and watching my numbers while dining or playing other games. For a $1 bet it could pay $30K, which was an attraction. They have several places to dine. My favorite was Angelina's, which offered, steak, lobster, Italian pasta's and more. It opened at 4:PM. Our waiter \"Tony\" was well versed, explaining the contents on the menu. The atmosphere was cozy, candle lite with soft music to enjoy. I'll go there again on Oct. 11th with family, to enjoy my 82nd birthday. They also have live comedy club entertainment which I did not attend.",
  "I found only 2 quarter slot machines.  It seems that most of the casinos in Nevada are removing their quarter machines and replacing them with pennies.  They must be bigger money makers for the casinos.  We had a drink at the bar and the bartender had no personality.  We dropped $50 in the casino and left....smelling like an ashtray. :-("

  "Went to Comstock around 1:30 p. today to redeem my 10 dollar match play coupon. Showed the coupon to the woman at the desk and asked if I had to wait at the machine to use the coupon. She said yes, and added \"you may have to wait a few minutes.\" So I found a machine, pushed the service light button, and inserted 10 dollars into the machine. And I waited \"a few minutes.\" And I waited \" a few minutes\" more, After 20 minutes I walked up to the woman at the desk and told her I'd come back when they weren't so busy. I may be retired, but my time is valuable to me. I could've been screaming \"fire\" and nobody would've noticed. I've been gambling there for years and have never seen such terrible service. Thanks a lot Comstock.",
  "Definitely somewhere between average and poor. It was very smoky. Not a whole lot of machines. Very dark period but for a local small Casino if that's your thing it could be ok. They have a sports book. Had a bar."

It is free to visit; although donations are encouraged.\n\nThere are very nice historical fire engines. There are some from the 1800s and later.  They are in superb condition.  There is also exhibits, photos of the fire staff of the Warren Engine Company, as well as some historic fire photos such as of the Prison Farm Fire of May 9, 1939 and also of the Carson City Opera House on April 5, 1931.\n\nit is a local gem of a museum to see.  It will take less than 1/2 hour to see but well worth the time.",
  "I found this by accident, one day when out for a walk.  It wasn't open, but the beautifully restored equipment could be seen through the windows.  When I went in to the fire station to ask about hours, they simply opened the museum for me!   Close up, the restoration is of Smithsonian quality.  Don't miss this one. ",
  "Working fire station. Walk in and they will be happy to open the museum door.\nGreat place to chat with the firemen. Attached to a large dog friendly park. Within a block of the Carson Mall.\n",
  "This museum is a hidden gem in Carson City, but worth the visit if you would like to see historic fire fighting apparatus.  There is even a Hunneman hand pumper, which I think was from the 1840s.  The volunteer staff member was very informative and friendly."

  "Fuji Park in the main is a good park.  The DOG PARK, however, leaves a great deal to be desired. It is dirt-based (no grass), and divided into small and large dog sections.  That would be OK, if the small dog owners stayed in the small dog section, but they don't. So you have yappy little dogs trying to exert their dominant on Great Danes.  Another disadvantage is that the regulars sit and chat with each other, pay no attention to their dogs (who steal other dogs' tennis balls), and don't clean up their dogs' waste.  There is a water spigot, but it drains into the dirt, so there is always a mudhole around it.  Sonoma Park is only a mile away, and much better.",

  "After several hours in the car, I thought I would give my boys some relief and let them stretch their furry legs. Fortunately, a quick search on Waze, turned up this park. \n\nLots of room for dogs to run, play and wag. The park also offers both small and large dog areas.\n\nI visited on Christmas Day."

The volunteers spent an hour explaining to two of us just the basics . It was amazing. I mean current technology is amazing but the spirit I if volunteerism is even more stunning to me . And I saw Jupiter with three moons and some galaxies and nebulae clusters :)\nThey have a whole citizen science with hundreds or maybe thousands of volunteers doing the asteroid occultation project.  I was amazed by spirit of volunteerism and cooperation of humankind. There are lots of amazing individual discoveries and accomplishments but the world as a whole is running on cooperation I more and more am certain about it.\n",

These include soccer fields, a skateboard park, an Olympic-sized indoor pool, BBQ and picnic areas, kiddie playground, horseshoe pits, a community center and an indoor pavilion, suitable for rodeos. On Independence Day this year, there was a full-fledged traveling carnival. There is a miniature riding railroad, which is, unfortunately, not operating currently. Something for everyone."

  "Sonoma Park is a five-acre, fully-fenced municipal park that is divided into a kiddie park and an off-leash dog park.  The kiddie par, which is nicely shaded with big trees, features a jungle gym, slides, swings picnic tables, a water fountain, and sanitary facilities (Port-a-potty).  The dog park is mostly open and grassy, with some shade trees at one end.  There are four gates, so you can avoid crowds at one end; a doggy water feature, and several doggy-bag dispensers and waste cans.  As long as owners clean up after their pups, it is a very nice dog park."

  "The entrance to Riverview Park is a dedicated memorial to those who lost their lives during the Korean War. It has three flags (US, Nevada and Korean), several memorial plaques and some benches.  RIVERVIEW PARK continues on beyond the Memorial, and provides a significant portion of Carson City's walking, equestrian, and off-leash dog-walking trails.  It is a 109-acre preserved area, which includes upland sagebrush, wetlands, and riparian ecosystems. Geese, several species of ducks, raptors, and owls are common, as are many species of smaller birds. There is also a small pack of coyotes, and the occasional rattlesnake. \nAmenities include restrooms, BBQs, picnic tables and a sheltered area.  Of historic interest are an outdoor brick oven and a milking shed from a 19th century ranch that once occupied the site.  VERY GOOD FOR OFF-LEASH DOGS!"

  "If Tripadvisor had a rating of 'Not Really Sure\" I would have selected it instead of the Average rating that I did. I have been asked to do this review before & declined because I really do not know if the destination that I ended-up at is the one that is listed in the header. I'll explain further. I was in Carson City, NV in January 2016 from the east coast as a visitor & did indeed set out to visit American War Birds, Inc. located at the listed address on College parkway. After searching for over 30 minutes for an obvious location centered around the airport, I went into a business directly associated with the activities of the airport & was told that the group that I was looking for was in a hanger just down field of their office. Once through the controlled-access gate I went to where I was directed & sure enough, there sat war birds-ahh, getting close. The adjacent hanger that I found had military vehicles & equipment displayed outside & I just knew that I had found what I was looking for... well, not so fast: No sign announcing American War Birds, Inc.- we have aircraft, we have vehicles & we have associated equipment. How could this be wrong? Odd though, over the hanger doors was a sign which read \"Cactus Air Force\". I walked the entire perimeter of the hanger looking for an obvious entry point thinking that the way that I came upon the destination was more private than public, but nope, just some unmarked personnel doors. I finally went to the one of the doors & knocked whereby a gentleman opened it & I asked if this was the \"museum\". He replied that it really wasn't a museum but I was welcome to come in anyway & look around. I explained that I was in from out of town & that I was a fanatic over vintage aircraft. Both of the gentlemen on board that day were very gracious with the time they spent with me & gave me the full tour. Because this is a review (?) of American War Birds, Inc. I won't go into what was housed within this restoration hanger, but believe me when I tell you that if you are interested in a couple of \"1-only's\" this is the place for you.\n\nSo here's my final thoughts: I have no idea if I was in what is the remnants of my original destination, but according to the local's that I talked to, this had to be the place. And if anyone has current information about where I visited vs where I was supposed to visit, please don't hesitate to tell me. I promised you a confusing review & I believe I have delivered exactly that.",
  "Love this stuff and cannot get enough. a great spot to go to view heroes of the last few wars. These birds are historic and rapuidly vanishing. You can admire what our service people flew and the conditions that they did it. A great record of the historu of armed fores aviation through the years.",
  "The web site doesn't allow you t book a flight directly but you can submit a message to ask about the availability of flights and you are immediately given the cell phone number of the pilot, Dennis. He was able to offer me a ride on the day I wanted and we just agreed to meet at he airport. No formalities here. Dennis is friendly, knowledgeable and experienced - all he things you need when taking a ride in a two-seater plane that's more than 60 years old.\n\nThe flight was smooth, the scenery wonderful and Dennis treated me to a loop, some rolls and other fun acrobatics over the middle of the lake. Dennis made sure I was comfortable at all times and was an excellent guide to all we could see. It was very enjoyable, ",
  "This was hands-down one of the most fun things I have ever done.  \n\nThe loops, rolls, strafing run, and the opportunity to control the aircraft with a champion air racer and flight instructor is something that you just shouldn't pass up if you have the opportunity.  The great stories and local tourism knowledge is just a bonus.\n\nHighly recommended!"

  "They have high quality items, will negotiate prices and can handle their own shipping.  Expect to take a while, as there are a lot of small items to examine as well as furniture, old movie posters and things to purchase and refinish for display.  Parking is easy, lots of nearby places to eat and only about 40 minutes from Lake Tahoe.  There are two entrances, and the rear entrance has a lot of items one might otherwise miss."

  "This ranch closed several years ago and is no longer operational.  Therefore, don't expect to ride horses on the trails.\nOwner moved to the Midwest.\n\n",
  "We went to find this place yesterday (9/7/14) and couldn't find it.  When we visited the Carson City Visitor Center the very helpful lady told us that the guy had moved out of town.  Too bad - it sounded more fun than just a trail ride.",
  "This is a great trail ride, whether you're a novice or experienced rider! We had the a bit of an exclusive trail ride on a delightful March day after another group cancelled. Wrangler Rich and crew make sure that you don't just leg up, but learn a little about grooming, safety and saddling up. Our trail ride took us out into the bush, through a stream and included great opportunities for a little canter here and there - definitely not just nose to tail trail ride. The scenery was stunning and the company delightful. We highly recommend R & D for a great trail ride experience!",
  "excellent adventure learning about horseback riding from the pro's at R and D Ranch!!!Weather was great for even a longer day ride. Will do more of these, definately!",
  "My friend and I had the pleasure of attending R and D Ranch this week for a winter ride through the Nevada plains. As knowledgable Australian  riders we were very much looking forward to and authentic American riding experience and something that had that 'edge' and I can happily report that this certainly had it and so much more. \n\nUpon arrival Wrangler Rich introduced us to our mounts and got us accustomed to our horses and saddlery. \nWe took a two hour ride up a close by mountain and I must say, the experience was one I will never forget. The horses were quiet, comfortable and confident and instilled in you a sense of complete safety. The beginner riders who accompanied us were smiling from ear to ear and had an amazing time also. \n\nIt is very hard to put into words just how wonderful this is. \n\nIt is in no way a quiet hack around a paddock! This is a breathtaking adventure that will leave you absolutely gobsmacked and begging for more. \n\nI have absolutely no hesitations in recommending Wrangler Rich and R and D ranch to anyone interested in a horseback adventure. \n\nAnd as for Wrangler Rich himself, it was an absolute honour to ride with someone with the knowledge, skills and experience that only genuine horsemen have! Whether you are an absolute beginner or an experienced rider, you will leave feally totally satisfied. \n\nR and D Ranch has that wow factor that really packs a punch!!!\n\nThank you so much, I look forward to visiting again soon.\n\nChannelle and Rhian!!"
