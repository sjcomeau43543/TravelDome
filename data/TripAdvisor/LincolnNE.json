  "If you want to see what plants will look like when planted; go here and sabre time and money.   Go in later summer so you get a feel for full foliage.   ",
  "Great little space for a larger city, like a badge of honor, but the plethora of annuals is rotated frequently--perhaps after fertilizer loses its grip--to keep the appearance of fresh and vivacious growth and make it new a few times a year. To me, this isn't a garden, it's an art gallery. If you want Nebraska, go to Spring Creek Prairie in Denton 30min southwest. I'm just in to artificial gardens no matter how well-intentioned. It gets QUITE crowded on weekend and lovely afternoons / evenings. Grandparents will love the place.",
  "Lincoln's Sunken Gardens are always worth a visit.  Lovely gardens, water features, and surprising tranquility for a location on major streets.  It's different every year, and different from summer into fall, so it's worth repeat visits.  Occasionally a friend and I will pick up lunch and take it to the Gardens--always the best lunch in town that way.  The Gardens have an interesting history.  The location was a city garbage dump.  A local citizen had a vision for something better, and the Gardens were created.  It's free and there's free parking.  Occasionally used for weddings.",
  "Unusual and attractive botanical and rose gardens in the heart of Lincoln. Great for weddings and photo shoots. Interesting all season, a must see in Lincoln!",
  "One of the most beautiful places in Lincoln in summer and fall. Prepare for a relaxing walk around sunken pools with beautiful flowers. I lived in the neighborhood so I'm a little biased. Great place for pictures or weddings has a gazebo. Little hard to get to.",
  "My mind was blown by all of the beautiful trees; flowers; butterflies, the pond, and the lilypads. The perfect setting for a date. ",
  "Beautiful garden. Every year a new color theme with so many diverse plants.  Love the Koi fish in the old ponds",
  "This public garden is a reclaimed city landfill.  It's located on the edge of the older residential district of Lincoln within walking distance of the Lincoln Children's Zoo.  There are koi ponds with lily-pads, annuals, perinials and water features.  It's a lovely spot to relax on any afternoon."

  "This is a comprehensive museum of automobiles from the beginning to today, with great emphasis on racing, engines, carburetors, and many innovative components.  Huge collection of toys, pedal cars, etc. Something for everyone from the history buff to the child.  Displayed beautifully.  Easy to access, and docents will tell you anything you want to know.  Highly recommended.",
  "Wonderfull place to spend a cold winter afternoon looking at the visual history of increasing speed. The show room has great period race cars and you can read about what was done to make them as fast as possible. The assortment of cars was outstanding and represented all types of racing vehicles.",
  "It doesn't matter what your automotive level of interest is. There will be something here that you love and will remember. My wife is not into cars at all, but loved the way everything was displayed. There are large displays of pedal cars, toy cars and even lunchboxes. What a wonderful place to have and visit in Lincoln NE.",
  "take your time and see it all. it will take a long time and believe me it's worth it. There's 3 floors of fantastic. No gift shop though so there's no drinks or snacks",
  "While it shows a great history of automobiles, there\u2019s other motorized vehicles in display. From the everyday vehicles to some, hmmmm, different types of all kinds. Best if you take a tour as they are very informative."

  "From the fan favorite train ride to the many animal displays including the opportunity to interact with butterflies, goats and ponies the Lincoln Children's Zoo provides a great experience for children and parents.",
  "This is just a treasure! With a 5 year old it is the perfect size, just the right amount of time and plenty of creatures to fascinate her! We had such a good time,  almost as almost ALL the animals were out and active, educational areas were stationed in a few different locations with animals and insects to actually pet/touch!  The staff was phenomenal.  We paid extra for a train ride and that was the perfect way to depart the zoo after a fun morning! We will definitely return whenever we are in town!",
  "As you walk into the Children's Zoo, the displays begin immediately. Just follow the path and tour the reptile building, monkeys, big cats, and so much more. Watch as the birds of many feathers cross your path, down to the pony rides, then stop and milk the cow, next is the goats and butterfly house, then off to the seals and camels. The huge turtles are usually out sun bathing and an absolute delight to watch...especially if you are not in a hurry. Go on to the concession stand, dig for dinosaur bones and continue to the otters and other water animals. Top the fun off with a ride on the Zoo Train and gift shop. One of the best kid stops in Lincoln.",
  "We enjoy taking our grandkids to the zoo. We have as much fun as they do. And we always take a train ride. A lot of things for the kids to do and places for grandparents to sit and watch the kids have fun.",
  "The Children's Zoo in Lincoln is an incredible experience for kiddos and for adults.  My husband and I have gone by ourselves and we have taken kids.\n\nMy favorite area is the giraffes.  I could watch the young and old alike delight in feeding them.  It costs $$ to buy the lettuce leafs - just make sure you get a solid hand ful for your fee.  Don't buy just one - you will want to get more!  Go ahead and buy more for the discount. If there is a child there that can't buy some, share!\n\nI love the Zoo and I love this city!",
  "The recent upgrades are great.  The giraffes are worth visiting for sure.   It isn\u2019t like the Omaha zoo, but easy to visit and you can enjoy just a few hours there.",
  "This year the Lincoln Children zoo started its Christmas program \"Lights at the Zoo\" It was truly an enchanting experience with all the Christmas decorations and displays encompassing the zoo. In addition, they provide you with 3-D glasses at the entrance which makes looking at the Christmas lights all around even more magical and unique. Also, there was an opportunity to make smores and ride the train if you shall choose. Overall, my family truly enjoyed the experience",
  "This zoo is a great treasure to have in Lincoln!  It is small enough to cover quickly, but has expanded tremendously in last 2 years to include exhibits found at large zoos.  There are many hands on experiences you can have (goats, small animals, giraffes, camels). My kids loved this zoo when they were little and now that they are grown and in college, they still loved it when we were there this fall!  \n\nThe train ride and tunnel are always a great hit and you can see the zoo from another angle."

  "The guy that designed the capitol did also design churches.  Next to the KS state capitol, this was the most unusual state capitol that we've visited.  The soaring tower made it stand out.  The huge use of mosaics in the decoration was fantastic.  I was interested to find a bust of a distant cousin, William Frederick Cody, in the hall of honor, because he was a resident of NE at one time.  The murals and door decorations were also very nice.    You can see all of Lincoln from the observation deck, and there is a almost synagogal atmosphere to the law memorial in the tower, surrounded by the observation deck",
  "I learned about the Nebraska Capitol Building through the The Library Book. The LA Central Public Library was his next project. After researching, I felt I really had to see it in person.\n\nThe architecture, sculpture, mosaics, and other works of art are beyond description. We arrived in time to have a guided tour, so were able to learn about many of the features and see the room that houses the Supreme Court. Afterwards I took the tiny elevator (not scary at all really) to the 14th floor. Not only is the view outstanding, but the stonework, the light fixtures and the additional murals were worth the trip up. We stayed about 1.5 hours.",
  "A true architectural marvel on the prairie. This stunningly unique capitol building dates to the 1920s and is full of amazing art deco motifs, murals and stonework from that glorious period. The only unicameral state legislature in the nation is quirky but interesting. Gift shop in the basement and take the lift to the observation deck if possible",
  "Amazing architecture inside and outside. Very much worth seeing. Bring a camera; you will be surprised at the depth of detail in the interior. It is really beautiful.",
  "The Nebraska state capitol building is a gorgeous old building with great photo ops for any occasion or just to wander and enjoy the beauty.  The panoramic views of Lincoln are nice.  Just a note:  the do close the outside observation area at the top in inclement weather so check before you go it that's what you want to see.  ",
  "This is one of the most unique and beautiful Capitol buildings in the country.  Be sure to take the guided tour that provides information and insight into its construction.  Every stone , mural, mosaic, and quote has meaning and purpose, telling the story of Nebraska and its people.  The observation decks provide a beautiful panoramic view of the city and countryside.  Visit on a Thursday, so you can also tour the Govenors mansion located across the street. ",
  "If you are interested in a location that combines all the arts in one, this is\nThe top of the list. Art deco neo classical building, murals, mosaics, sculpture,  symbolism and the written word. No cost for entry and tours on the hour. One of the 100 significant buildings in USA according to the AIA (American Institute of Architects ).",
  "Founded in 1482 by Mr. Nebraska himself, the capitol building is carved out of one continuous piece of granite. Cool stuff!",
  "This is a unique gem of a building. No expense was spared on the design, art, mosaics, furnishings. So many intricate wood and stone details. Truly and architectural wonder! We make it a point to visit state capitols when we travel and this one in beyond compare.",
  "My family and I took the guided tour on March 6, 2020 at 4pm. Our tour guide was Kirk, who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the State Capital and the surrounding area. The guided tour takes about 1 hour, you will start at the entrance, learn about the mosaic tile art that is truly incredible. As you proceed through the halls, each section has a story attached to it. Then you will proceed to the State Senate Chamber, which is really pretty cool to see, the chamber was empty with the exception of a few pages having a meeting. Then it was off to see the State Supreme Court Chambers, this was our last stop. Then we were encouraged by our tour guide Kirk to take a ride on the elevator to the 14th floor where we experienced awesome city views of Lincoln. \n\nIf you are traveling or just passing through, take the time to visit the State Capital of Nebraska, it's free and very enjoyable.",
  "Built in the 30s, it's amazing how the mosaics can be seen as before their time in design as well as timeless. The outlook from the top is breathtaking, seeing so much of Linco!n. The architecture is !just Amazing!!!! \n "

  "It was Sunday before Memorial Day, and after church and breakfast with the family, my granddaughter introduced me to this gem of nature within the City of Lincoln. She drove me around and showed me the sights. There are great trails for walking and running. She is a cross country runner, as are, mom, dad, brother and sister, and they often train here with their bird dog, too. A wonderful place for photography which they make great use of. My imagination ran wild as I could envision this beautiful park in it's natural state before Lincoln was settled. Nice big pond, old schoolhouse and even an outhouse; it reminded me of when and where I grew up. I loved the American bison, as we got to admire eight of them for quite a while. Too much else to mention. I am looking to spend more time here next year. Highly recommended! ",
  "Leashed dogs, children and adults enjoying nature trails, outdoor theatre, picnic and an assortment of gated large animals.  ",
  "A great park with tons to see and explore! You could easily spend all day here. A must-see is the nature center where there are hiking trails and live animals on display.",
  "We stopped by here and it was miserably cold and windy in October. Not the best day for a visit! The woman at the visitor center was so friendly and outgoing that we couldn't keep being in a bad mood about the weather. We braved the outdoors to admire the bison and to take a walk along the lake to see the red-tailed hawks. If it was nicer, we definitely would have explored more but as it was, it was a great chance to stretch our legs and admire the scenery before getting back on the road.",
  "Lived in Lincoln twice over the years but only ever visited the columns. This time I took my son to the nature center and the kids play areas. So many trails to walk or bike. ",

  "It was drizzling and we decided to just take a drive over and check out this park. The nature center was a little hard to find but we did. The lady in the one building was very helpful and gave us a map of the walking trails. With our raincoats we set out. Some trails were cement/stone..others were just grass. But well marked. They have an elk, owl, and buffalo. We spent a couple hours there and thoroughly enjoyed it!",
  "Pioneers Park is a beautiful place for people seeking commune with nature.  When I visited here on a Sunday morning in July, people were already on the trails walking and running on the trails that were open; more trails open up after noon (on Sundays) for hiking at which time also the Nature Center opens.  But the trails that were open did provide access to beautiful sections in the park including the Columns, the Bison Overlook, and several ponds and prairies.  There is a marker at the Columns about the interesting history of how the columns from Washington DC were installed here.  The trails that were open for bicycles are concrete paved and well maintained.  Only, I found trail markers and maps to be inadequately posted.  Early in the morning it appeared there were a lot of birds in the trees gauging from all the chirping and singing.  But, I did not see any animals.  Also, the bison were not visible from the overlook (they must have been grazing somewhere down in the valley).\n\nThe park has a Nature Center, but I did not go there."

  "No parking unless  you get there a day early to tailgate. To get there, chances are lots of traffic. We used Lyft to make it there. Parking is hard to find downtown, parking lots get full fast. There's lots of walking no matter what. Full of energy, for most part people are friendly. Personally, i hated it, I don't like sweaty people and claustrophobic. I'd rather be at home watching the game in my tv and my couch. But the hubby loves it, the atmosphere. It's great really - just not for me. I  went back by the concessions and watched the game from one of the flat screens. The restrooms were clean, lots of concession stands for you to choose from. Recent WiFi addition was wonderful.",

  "Nebraska mus think ever human is skinny.  The seats are so small you eventually feel like you are sitting on your neighbors lap.  They provide seat cusions for $5 donation, you put several of them in a row and you will overlap someone else's seat. \n\nAtmosphere was abosulutely amazining.  You want tickets on the East side of the stadium or lower level of the west side.  We were row 44 and had obstructive view of the game.  Plus, they don't indicate on the tickets that the seats are obstructed."

The cucoo clock is one of a kind and the water room is amazing! The water table has seats for babies to sit in to play.  Feel like the price is a little steep, especially for older kids.

  "I live in in Lincoln so luckily I can visit this museum often.  The quilts on display are from all over the world and are fascinating to see.  The exhibits change regularly so there is always something new to explore.  They have a great gift shop along with lectures and workshops by visiting quilt authorities.  The annual Art Market held in November is a fundraiser for the museum and features local artisans.  Check the museum\u2019s website for more information at quiltstudy.org.",
  "I used to live 3 blocks away and watched it being built and watched it double. They have on-line resources that will blow your mind. You can look up quilts by color, style, era, and many other categories. In the building they have a small theater where you can use the computer to bring the quilts you want to see up on a life size screen. They have international speakers come to enlighten on their area of expertise. They curate wonderful exhibits. They have controlled environment storage so well organized you can locate any quilt and bring it forth.\n\nI have had a quilt identified on ID Day. The exhibits are so well done I can not imagine being disappointed in any of these activities.",
  "I had missed Ken Burns\u2019 display of quilts but I was determined to visit the museum at some point. The displays were absolutely beautiful. If you love arts and crafts and especially quilts you will appreciate the quilts and handwork on display. I was able to see quilts from India, many states in the USA, and Europe were exquisite. The soldiers made by soldiers were unique and displayed much artistry.",
  "My review would have to echo many of the others.  This is a gorgeous new glassy building.  The quilts on hand were immaculate and the signs on hand were educational.  There are not as many displayed as you might think, in such a large building.  The virtual displays that our local host told us about were not available, due to some construction in the museum when we were there.  \nI'm not a huge quilt aficionado, but I do enjoy history and handmade craftiness, so I enjoyed our brief visit.  I wouldn't tell anyone to come from far away for this as their main destination, but if you are in town and have an hour to check it out, it is worth the visit.",
  "If you like quilts, this is a definite place to stop in.  Admission is free on the first Friday of every month.  It starts at 4 PM and lasts until 7 PM.  One of the current exhibits they are featuring are \u201ccheddar\u201d quilts from the late 1800s to the early 1920s.  There was quite an array of quilts to see from this time period.  Another exhibit featured African quilts.  A smaller exhibit featured log cabin quilts.  All the exhibits had an introductory plaque explaining the origination, history and purposes of the type of quilt shown.  Additional plaques are beside each quilt explaining in further detail about them with additional historical facts such as the years (or possible years) and the quilter\u2019s name if it was known. ",
  "Even if one is not a \"Quilter\" a visit to this attraction will cause a person to admire the care, creativeness, skill and workmanship that goes into making beautiful quilts.  The building itself is an excellent example of good museum building design, and allows for the display of the quilts as works of art (which they are).  For the casual visitor, one to two hours will yield a good experience.  For those who ARE quilters then more time will be required!",
  "Not a quilter but someone in our group is and I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the visit.  The quilts are nicely presented.  We added to the fun by choosing our favorite in each of the galleries.  I particularly liked the double-sided quilts \"Dualities\" by Emiko Toda Loeb.",
  "As exhibits change from time to time, this is not a once and done kind of place.  Currently, the Old World Quilt exhibit is a must see.  You won\u2019t want to miss the exquisite embroidery on these \u201cflat\u201d quilts.  On the way, take a peak at the quilts in the Whimsy exhibit.  Of special interest is the 43 pound quilt embellished with buttons.  And don\u2019t miss the sock monkey quilt while you\u2019re there!",
  "Get there early. They open late and close early. We drove to Paducah to the museum there and then to Lincoln, but the museum was closing as we got there. We did not get to see it because we were on a tight schedule.",
  "We stopped in Lincoln on a roadtrip across the country and were looking forward to visiting the museum. What we saw was pretty amazing in terms of  design and implementation. \n\nDualities was especially impressive. We both understood immediately the value of these quilts as artwork. Whimsy had some fun quilts. All those buttons! The quilts from around the world so interesting.\n\nWhat was lost was tying all the quilts together.  Why were they chosen. What impact have they had on the quilting world?",
  "What a wonderful museum.  Sweet gift shop with unique items.  The quilts on display were fabulous .  Such detail.  The photos attached are two quilts front and back.  Realize my attempts are rather primitive."

  "I imagine some may not find this to be the flashiest museum in the USA, but it contains a wealth of unique exhibits, as well as some unique research focuses. As might be expected, it contains the best Nebraska geography and wildlife dioramas in the world. It contains a world-class woolly mammoth exhibit - possibly the world\u2019s best (including the world\u2019s largest mounted mammoth - \u201cArchie\u201d). And they just spent over $10m redoing just the 4th floor to focus on Great Plains ecology, climate change, geography, biology, zoology, archeology, etc. It\u2019s very impressive.",
  "visited over 4th, spent a few hours. who knew NE had rhinos and elephants. very nice museum on NE history good collection of fossils prehistoric  to present. new this year 4th floor opened with overview of native Americans, importance of water, current environmental issues. do visit well worth it. Support local",
  "This is a fantastic place to go as a family or to have a playdate.  They offer a variety of things to see and hands-on activities for all ages.  Look for special events and two months of the year they offer free admission on Thursdays. \n\nI have two boys ages 3 & 7, we have a blast when we go here. I love looking at all the old stuff and explaining it to my kids and they love to make up stories and check out all the interactive parts of the exhibits!",

  "This museum is inexpensive and yet gives hours of entertainment and history lessons.  It has a lot of exhibits showing everything come the ancient age to today.  The dinosaur exhibit is worth the price of admission alone.  Who know there were that many dinosaurs in that area?  The top floor is the most recent and has an excellent hands on for the kids.",
  "We took our granddaughters, eight and four, and figured they would like the mammoth exhibit and not much else. They loved everything and took their time with every exhibit. Plenty of kid friendly things.",
  "Very impressed by the climate change exhibit, particularly poignant as eastern Nebraska experienced major flooding less than 2 weeks before my visit was scheduled. Also really drawn to the prairie-specific exhibits, including taxidermy of birds (I was visiting to see the sandhill crane migration.)",
  "Go back in time with a visit to this fantastic museum, one of the best we have ever seen. It took a little to find the place and there is parking next to the building on the east side. It is also called Elephant Hall. The museum houses a huge, rare collection of elephants and their extinct ancestors, which roamed the plains. It features 13 mounted skeletons and other fossil mammals. There are displays of the Nomads of the plains and special exhibits. You can also see the Mueller Planetarium."

  "Brand new facility.  I have been to a few events there.  Pretty typical arena.  The downside is that parking is very scarce.  Unless you are a local, or are staying at one of the hotels by the arena, plan on getting there very early and grabbing a bite or drink at one of the plentiful restaruants/bars near the facility.  The arena is not overly large, so it is a good place to get a decent concert experience.",
  "My wife and I saw Carrie Underwood at the Pinnacle Bank Arena and really enjoyed our time there. We had seats on the 2nd level and could see the stage really well. The food and beer stations on the 2nd concourse were not really busy, so it was quick and easy to get our overpriced $5.50 piece of pizza and $8 beer. \n\nOur biggest complaint from last night was not opening the doors until 45 minutes before the show started. Online we saw the doors were going to open at 5:30, but it was about 6:15 before they let anyone in, which made it seem like a mad dash to get to your seats. Also, the parking and ability to have dinner is less than ideal in the Haymarket before a big event.",
  "This is a top of the line venue with tons of amenities, including various food joints and sports shops.  It's got ample parking along with various walkways to and from the venue.  It's front doors open up to the historic haymarket region of Lincoln Nebraska.  This area has several great restaurants and shopping areas.  ",
  "We enjoyed watch the Husker women play basketball.  We were able to feel the atmosphere rocking when we scored.",
  "Good views, acoustics, etc.  Restrooms were spacious and clean.  Good staff and accessibility for wheelchair users. ",
  "In my estimation this is a world class arena. I have attended sporting events and concerts numerous times and I have enjoyed the venue immensely. Seating is comfortable with reasonable space between rows.  Concessions are readily available on all levels and there are parking garages in close proximity. Parking can be purchased online ahead of any event.",
  "I really enjoy this arena. Views are great for sporting events and the sound system is very good for concerts as well. Staff has been friendly and it is relatively easy to enter and exit. Concourses are fairly wide and signage for sections is good. Maybe the best part of all is the variety of establishments to visit before and after the event in the surrounding area.",
  "This was my first time going to this arena. I was surprised at how easy it was to get in the arena for the concert find a parking spot. We actually lucked up and seen a women leaving when we were arriving. The walk was not far at all. there were desperate doors for the different levels when entering. Grabbing concession was a breeze the seats we chose were floor seats and were great. Security was rude at this event. Overall it was way worth seeing Cardi B."

There is now food and drink offered, as well as security and handicpped parking.  Be aware: do NOT attempt to take in food or umbrellas or lawn chairs, you will be turned away at the gate. Overall a great place to see a show.    ",

If the weather isn't to hot and it's not going to rain it's a great place for these sort of activities.  Parking is a bit of an issue but they do a nice job of controlling the traffic both in and out but be patient.  Stop afterwards and get an ice cream out side the east gate.  Yummy",

Several exhibits display artifacts and stories about everything from comic art to aviators and politics. Only interesting for history buffs.",
  "This was a great attraction for an out-of-state visitor. Fascinating exhibits showing timeline of the history of Nebraska. Great gift shop, as well!",
  "The new remodeled look really makes this museum back on your map of things to look at while visiting Lincoln. Nebraska history is finally reborn! Lots of new areas and things to see. Parking can be hard to find so you may want to find a parking garage a couple blocks away and hit one of the many good places to eat downtown as you walk to the museum. The staff is friendly, especially Kelsey who works at the front desk. He gave us some good tips and helped us enjoy our visit. Thank you!",
  "We dropped by twice in a single week.  The first time, we briefly toured the entire museum, to get the lay of the land.  On our second visit, we focused on the exhibits of historical photos, very interesting, as well as the quilts.  The staff is soooo helpful, and the gift shop is lovely.  If you are looking for a small quilt to take home, the museum has an admirable collection at surprisingly reasonable prices.  ",
  "The museum has been recently renovated. However the displays and exhibits are rather sparse. They are gearing up towards the major opening next spring in March 2017 to celebrate the 150th birthday in Nebraska. young children will find some items to look at and listen to.

There is good signage directing you to the museum with several exhibits along the route. The staff are office workers who will help you, if necessary, but the museum is self guided. By the way, there is no admission charge but there is a donation box if you are so inclined. There is an impressive amount of roller skating memorabilia and it is primarily directed toward amateur roller skating (not roller derby). There is a gift shop, but I think you must ask an office staff member to unlock it.",
  "There is a whole world of roller skating most people don't know about. They do everything the ice skaters do in the Olympics but on roller skates: figure skating, speed skating, group routines.

  "Lovely building. We visited during an event which adds music and extra exhibits. They have some fabulous pieces in their permanent collection. I especially enjoy the outside exhibits.",
  "We visited on a very slow day during Spring Break.  Parking nearby is by meter, and you've got to have a credit card or change handy.  The people on duty were attentive and well informed, and they were obviously proud of what they had, too.  The rotating collections were interesting, well lit, and thoughtfully arranged.  The permanent collection, too, showed all sorts of great things, including a surprisingly good Impressionist collection.  It's not a huge museum--which is probably good, let's be honest about our ability to stare at art for hours on end--and they use the space well, breaking up pieces in a way that makes sense and make you think of the collection differently (for example, one room had things that were all made of clay, though not everything is immediately obvious as clay).",
  "I have to review Sheldon again (I had a glowing review March 2018).  The current exhibit on Portraits and Portraiture is not to be missed. Showing u til July 2020  For a FREE entrance, you will see gems showcased in the National Gallery of Art. Diane Arbus, Kehinde Wiley (who did President Obama\u2019s portrait), Cindy Sherman, the list goes on and on.\n\nPlus, ask for a map of the out door sculptures and take your own tour of the 30+ sculptures.",

  "My group stopped here for a beer dessert on a recent weeknight.  The place was decently busy, but not packed.  You can order food from Single Barrel across the street.  We tried several beers (all dark) and were very impressed.  Sometimes when tasting a beer, you have to search for the ingredient listed in the description.  This was not the case here.  All the beers were big, powerful and brimming with flavor.  If you want something subtle you maybe should ask the server.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  The space is fun since it is in the basement of the Grand Manse (former boiler room) and has exposed brick and dim lighting.  Street parking can be a challenge, but it is worth a return visit.",

Who does that?\n\nWe ordered bar food from across the street and it was delicious; I may have liked my plate. Try the pulled pork tacos.\n\nService was outstanding. Fun, friendly servers.\n\nAlso, an interesting ambiance; casual and cozy.",
  "We enjoyed our lunch visit to Boiler Brewing Company.  Our server Adam was very knowledgeable about the beers and provided us with lots of information.  The IPAs we sampled were very good.  We ordered a pulled pork sandwich that was delicious.  The venue is very neat, a former boiler room in the basement of the old courthouse. This is a must stop when you are in Lincoln.",
  "Boiler Brewing Company is literally in a former boiler room - in the Grand Manse, the repurposed former federal building/post office downtown. The original post office lobby is stunning - \"They don't make 'em like that any more\" stunning. The building contains a ballroom, a dining space, a restaurant or two, a donut shop and offices and apartments.  \nThe Boiler Brewing Company has a large selection of beers. The only thing missing was a red, but they may have them at other times, as the beers rotate. 5 oz. \"tasters\" aren't free - they vary in price. I tried a light pilsner (very economical), a raspberry wheat with a long name - something about red jeans and pigtails, or something like that. Hubby and I split a neat mead. Thanks to being made from honey from rare flowers in Washington state, the 5 0z. was $10! It was yummy. The food menu is pretty short. The food comes in a box from a restaurant across the street, resulting in a tasty but slightly soggy Reuben and coolish fries. There were quite a few munchies, which might be a better choice.",
  "This little gem is a hidden treasure in Lincoln, NE. They have some of the most unique brews you will find anywhere in the state. We visited before a Husker Game and thru handled the crowd no problem.  Great staff, Great beer, what more can you ask?",
  "Looking for a spot for local craft beer? Look no further. The Boiler Room offers a wide range of selections brewed on site. Great atmosphere, our server Ryan was helpful and the beer was great. ",
  "What can I say about this place other than my husband and I loved it. We tried several hazy IPAs, Gose and Peanut Butter stout. All of the above were delicious. So good in fact we came back that night for more. Highly recommend for all those beer lovers out there!",
  "Unique brewery and they have some of the best beers around. So many different styles of beers and great staff that know theirs brews."

  "I love taking the dogs on hikes at Wilderness Park.  The trails are well-marked and well-trodden, but keep a sharp eye out for bicyclists - they seem to appear from nowhere and with no warning.  The trails are marked for hikers, bikers, and horseback riders, and I think people pretty much mind the signs.  There are folks who will let their dogs run off-leash (and shouldn't), so keep a lookout for them!  ",

  "This park stretches for several miles along the west edge of Lincoln. It has a nice bike trail with good bridges that stretches the length of the park. This is a great place to get away and enjoy nature, possibly see deer and fox.",
  "Like taking my dogs for walks here. Pretty, peaceful and secluded. Do wish they would mow better and clean up the area better, Kinda getting unruly.",
  "Late afternoon walk with dog. Paths were clean and clear. Guests were friendly and polite. Trails are marked for bikes, hikers or horses. Had no issue finding my way and staying on the hiking trails."

  "If you like tractors and enjoy seeing vintage tractors, this is the place for you. Located on the east campus of the University of Nebraska--Lincoln, this is home the the testing facilities used to certify performance of every tractor model sold in the state of Nebraska. Our volunteer tour guide was excellent and highly informative. The museum is in the original test facility, while the current facilities are just down the hill. Donation recommended.",
  "First of all, the voluteer staff were top notch as they were both informative and kind. The museum itself was a short and sweet adventure if you love learning about the history of Nebraska and farming. ",
  "By State Law since 1920, every tractor marketed in Nebraska has to be tested and certified to perform as advertised. The first state to do so and still required for 100+ horsepower tractors, today every state and most countries use the Nebraska data to allow tractor sales. The museum has dozens of old tractors and also test devices from the 1920's. Located on the campus it's a little tricky to find but well worth a visit. Cost is only $5, guides are very good and there's a neat gift shop",
  "Quilt museum staff recommended this place to husband while I was at the quilt museum. He really enjoyed seeing the old tractors and learning information while on the $10 tour. He was the only person there so he had a very personal tour with the knowledgeable guide. He also learned about the Nebraska law that requires all tractor models be tested before they can be sold in NE.",
  "This museum is a lot more interesting than you might expect. It is especially interesting if you are given a guided tour by Don (I think). He is a retired Dean from University of Nebraska and restores old tractors as a hobby. I don\u2019t think there is anything about antique tractors that he doesn\u2019t know."

Family friendly and an excellent offering by the community.",

The project area is owned by the Lower Platte North Natural Resources District (LPNNRD) and was developed in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission provided in-lake and recreation design input.",
  "A beautiful place for birding. Came here off season. Would be beautiful for camping in warmer weather.",
  "Nebraska has some handy campgrounds that are easily accessed when driving across the state. We needed a place for the night and pulled in here. We were there in early October, so that even on a Saturday night, it was fairly deserted. (Except where the larger RVs were.) Seems to be a pretty area, from our quick walkabout the next morning. Quiet and tidy with flat, paved sites. I will note that the bathrooms (both here and at another state park) seem very outdated and poorly constructed, given the amount of traffic I'm guessing that they receive. The pit toilets were in decent shape, but they might want to invest in improvements to the main bathrooms.",
  "This is a very nice RV and Tent Campground.  It was where we spent our first two nights camping, on a cross- country road trip.  We wanted to be assured a site, so we made arrangements, on-line, through the Nebraska State Park Website.\n\nNot all of the campsites are reservable.  I counted 36 reservable sites.  They have electricity available, I believe 50 & 30 amp service, as well as two 110 plugs.  We were tenting, so didn't need the electric, but did use the 110 plugs to charge our cell phones.  As an Illinois resident, we had to pay additional to reserve a site.  The cost was $20.00 a night, plus  a reservation fee and taxes.  Even though this may seem a bit high, for tent campers, I enjoyed the nicely wooded sites, and the hot showers and flush toilets, included in the fee.\n\nWater is available from ground water pumps, behind sites 55 & 56, on the road we were located on.  Other drinking water pumps are available throughout the campground.  The hot showers and restrooms were a short walk from our camp site.  The grass has been mowed down to provide a clear path to the facilities.  Behind our site was a small canyon, so we had no one behind us.\n\nPawnee Lake is very nice.  It's clear that locals come out and swim, boat, and fish at the lake.  We had ice chests, for our perisable food, but there are no General Store on site.  So we drove into Lincoln to replenish our chests with ice.  Also, if you want to have a fire, I would suggest picking up a couple of bundles of wood before entering the site, as no good wood is available at the camp site.  The picnic table was great, anchored in a cement pad.  The parking spaces are paved and level, all a very nice set up with mature trees.  I recommend this camp site!\n",
  "Was rather annoyed by the mean man who was cleaning the restrooms. I greeted him good morning and he grunted at me like he was annoyed. And then after having a great weekend we were very rudely informed that our generator ( which is very quiet) had the whole lake \"up in arms\" Then he stormed off. Lovely lake and very peaceful out there. Just be weary of grouchy old jerks that go on power trips and act like petty tyrants"

  "The Lux Center\u2019s First Friday featured 3 Native American artists. All 3 worked with mix media.  First, thank you to the Lux for having an art exhibit showcasing Native Americans.  It was nice to see minority representation from the artistic community.  I found the art displayed to be contemporary and thought provoking while still maintaining an ethnic feel.  There was another exhibit featuring ceramics. It was interesting to see how the artist incorporated wood as a way to display his ceramic pieces. I also liked how he was there to explain his pieces and how he came by his materials.  I was impressed with the fact of how he used wood from a shop in Omaha.  I am a strong supporter of the use of local and/or state resources. If any of the Native American artists had made an appearance, it wasn\u2019t while I was there.

  "Our granddaughter's high school graduation ceremonies were here last Sunday.  The seats were very comfortable.  Our view from the 3rd floor balcony was perfect.  I use  a wheelchair, so one of the ushers took my husband to show him possible places for all of us to sit.  He was very kind and took great care of us.  Found us a perfect spot where I only had to manage 3 steps.  Super nice facility.",
  "Great evening for theatre. The drink line was long but luckily the restroom line was fast.  Great venue for a night of theatre.",
  "We paid almost $800 for Monty Python\u2019s Spamalot, and missed 70% of the spoken words due to acoustic limitations. Lyrics with music were better, but from our seats in the balcony it was a bust,",
  "a few night ago friends and our family went to hear a well known group of performers   , here..although we paid a good price for the tickets I won't be going back as sound quality for the balcony was poor and the seats were much smaller than comparable venues.If you chose seast carfully ."

  "Difficult to find a decent store. Sporting good store is all anyone cares about. Good stores left long ago. This was a great place in the 1970s. Left the city for 30 years and came back to find the 'mall' not at all what it once had been. I try to stay away from this place. ",
  "Had lunch with my colleague at the restaurant situated in the mall. Tried the bunnychow it was delicious and the waiters were friendly and helpful",
  "My kids enjoyed the playground on our short trip to Lincoln. It was easy to find with all the signs hanging in the mall.",
  "Gateway has a great variety of stores to chose from, great for grabbing some after Christmas sales. Loved the Dilliard's and Sears. Busy place but a great day at the mall.",
  "We really enjoyed shopping at Gateway Mall.  It's filled with stores with mid range prices.  (Think JC Penney, Dillard's)  It's fairly large and has lots of stores.  The food court had a nice selection of restaurants.   It's a great place to shop."

  "A must see historic district alive with nightlife, restaurants and bars. Really hopping on Cornhusker football game days!",
  "This area has such cool shops, bars, coffee shops, stores, hotels, etc. Lots of variety. They also have a really cool train engine to get pics with. I really liked their fun mural!",
  "I didn't know what to expect when I was heading to the Haymarket District when visiting Lincoln. I expected the typical town centre, but Haymarket is different. :)",
  "Wear your walking shoes.  A great way to spend a day- lots of shops and restaurants.  Great for pedestrians.  Close to Pinnacle Bank Arena, Lincoln Station, much, much more.",
  "I remember when this area was nothing but an old depot and some old warehouses, but oh how times have changed. \nThis area is thriving with plenty of restaurants, pubs and a few motels. The area is the place to be before a sporting event or concert. The area attracts large crowds of people so expect to have to wait to be served at many establishments. \nThe Haymarket area is kept clean and and the area is safe to stroll through any time of day or night. There is metered parking on the street and parking lots in the area. If you are visiting on a day of a special event, I would suggest parking in another area downtown and walking to the Haymarket. Memorial Stadium is a short walk and the Pinnacle Bank Arena is in the same area.\nI was actually surprised to see so few reviews for the Haymarket. All the establishments in the area have many reviews so if your looking at a specific business, you should be able to find plenty of reviews. \nIf you are traveling to Lincoln to watch a Husker football game and you are supporting the visiting team, rest assured that you're welcome in the area and will have a good time. Yes, there are jerks everywhere, but Huskers fans are very respectful and happy to have opposing fans travel to Memorial Stadium."
