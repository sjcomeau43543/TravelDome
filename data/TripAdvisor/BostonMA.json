   "Fenway Park is one of the oldest baseball parks in the USA. The green monster was fantastic. Being there in person really make you appreciate the size and hright of the wall.",
   "Fenway Park is a great place to enjoy the tradition of baseball. It has an unique atmosphere and is rich of baseball memories. ",
   "I went for The Who concert. The view was great, the sound was fantastic!! Easy to get in and out of the traffic. Loved it. ",
   "I love the fact that Fenway is located in Downtown Boston - an easy walk from anywhere in the City. Fenway is more than a ballpark, it is a destination. With the opening of TimeOut in the neighborhood, you can now eat at a 5 Start restaurant before or after the game! ",
   "We had a great tour of Fenway Park with our tour guide, John. He had been to over 400 games there as a lifelong resident of nearby Newton. So, not only did we get to see all around the building, but we learned stuff about the players, the history of the site, the history of baseball and the history of the Red Sox. We got to see the club house, the press box, the general seats, as well as up on the Green Monster! The tour took about 1.5 hours and it was very impressive. While we have been there to games in the past, we hadn't taken the tour. It was well worth the price!  It was March and so much work was being done to get the place in shape for the season to begin.  There sure is a lot that goes into each and every game but if you're a history/baseball fan, you will love all the displays that really give a ton of information!"

You can easily make a day of it.  If you're in Boston just for the day, I recommend just doing that.",

There was also a temporary exhibit on mindfulness and one on how art withstands the tests of time, and the Bouchra Khalili exhibit especially was outstanding.  This museum also offers studio classes, as well as films, music, and performance art.  The staff are friendly and helpful, and the museum is well-organized so you can't get lost accidentally.  The building itself is a work of art.",
   "I had an appointment in the Morse Study room to see some works on paper. The staff was very accommodating! I love this museum. It's easy to navigate, the collection is outstanding, and the placards are informative. My one disappointment is the cafe - it's so high priced you can't afford to bring your family. ",

   "The MFA always has wonderful exhibits, community events, and of course stunning permanent exhibits as well. I became a member and go several times a year. Well worth it!",
   "Arrive right as the Museum opens and take in as much as you can before the crowds arrive. The collections are amazing and you could spend a day in each collection.  One of the best places to visit in Boston."

   "This museum is an interactive experience where you are given a role as a son or daughter of liberty. The guides do a great job of staying in character and playing off the group\u2019s energy. Overall a fun experience and nothing quite like chucking a box of \u201ctea\u201d into the harbor. The museum is a mix of movies and artifacts that are deftly woven into the act.

His presidency was before my time, so I learned a lot about him and his family.  This is a great museum. \n There isn't a lot about his assassination here, but for that, you will want to visit the 6th Floor Museum in Dallas, Texas. ",
   "All the details on JFK\u2019s presidency, life and times was awesome. There\u2019s a piece of the Berlin Wall.  Artifacts related to WW2 service, clothing, and the glamor.  The first thing that struck me was the floor to ceiling wall of glass the great view of Boston harbor and cape cod bay.",
   "I had wanted to visit for a long time and I'm so glad I did.  The experience was very moving.  I felt like we were brought back in time and were able to share in some of the experiences of the amazing president.  This is a must see piece of American history.",
   "I saw this in 2004, but this museum still sticks with me even though that was sixteen years ago.  If you have never read my reviews, I am not a museum person.  Very few attract my attention.  This would be one of them.  John F. Kennedy, whether you like him or hate him, was a fascinating person in our country's history.  This museum has artifacts from his younger life to his presidency.  There was a video that you watched before you went in to the see the exhibit.  It is on the outskirts of the city, but worth it.  ",
   "I was one of only 2 people in the Museum after it opened. There was an excellent film about the president's life. The lobby of the theater section had memorabilia and stories of the president from youth to president. Other than that there was a beautiful view of Boston Harbor, a gift shop and nothing else. I thought the library was something you could see . "

   "Family was visiting from out of town, and we were looking for something fun to do on a cold winter afternoon.  We decided to take the Classic Tour at Sam Adams Brewery.  There is no charge, (although a donation is suggested - all money goes to support community endeavors).  Since it was. Friday, there were tours scheduled every half-hour.  We didn't have to wait, and walked right in.  The tour guide was well-informed, and kept things moving, and humorous.  The tour consisted of a brief history of Sam Adams beer, how it was made, and the research and development that kept it changing.  It ended with a tasting of three different beers (you get to keep the tasting glasses.). It is located near the Stony Brook T stop on the Orange line.  There is a very small parking lot, or else street parking.  This was a great tour, and kept us out of the wind for 1 hour!",
   "Are you in or near Boston? Do you have an hour or so to spare? Do you like beer? If the answers to these questions are \u201cyes\u201d then you need to get over to the Samuel Adams Brewery tour. \n\nThe free tour, while not extensive (most production brewing is done at other sites) -is fun and informative. We have done a number of brewery tours before at both large and small breweries - this was the best one by far. \n\nOur knowledgeable guide explained Samuel Adams Brewery\u2019s history, brew process, and even let us taste some of the brew ingredients. But the highlight was a stop in the tap room where we all tried several different beers and got a quick lesson in the finer points of beer tasting. \n\nOverall a good time! ",
   "Great tour here, looking at how the beer is made and what is included, which was very informative. The tour is free, which is surprising as these are normally paid for. You get to sample 3 types of beer after and are told about them. The gift shop offers a wide variety of beer to but which I have done for returning to England. After went to the Tap Room and I would highly recommend it for a fun afternoon trying various beers.",
   "Things have changed noticeably since my last visit but the new plan is good. First of all, the tour and tasting is still really fun and the charitable support from our donations is commendable. The easy ride from downtown on the Orange Line of the T gets you right to the brewery. The short wait for a tour is in an interesting area. The guides are fun and informative. The beer education is interesting and the tasting room is a highlight of the experience. I have never ended a tour without buying something in the gift shop so I guess no one else should either. The new tap room provided a great opportunity to sample beers beyond those offered on the tour. This is a fun part of visiting Boston and I will do it again the next time I come. ",
   "A dull day with some rain encouraged us to visit the 'famous' Samuel Adams Brewery which was worthwhile. The guide explained the complete process of beer production. Our small group of 6 finished off with a commemorative small glass and then sampled 3 or 4 styles of beers produced on site with personal reviews and opinions of the tastings.\n\nThere is a gift shop selling everything SAM ADAMS. \n\nThe Orange line from DOWNTOWN takes you to Stony Brook and from there a 5 minute walk to the Brewery."

Boston Science museum offers many exhibits that fall into interests of kids, teens and even adults. I enjoyed the electricty show a lot - having read about the strength of electricty when i was a kid but never experienced anything practically. The exhibit is must go for every one. \n\nYou may want to skip the 4d theatre, its not worth it. I have been to better 4d theater in the past and did not find this super interesting. But if you never visited one, you will be amazed. Good luck. \n\nStay safe and healthy",
   "We visit this museum multiple times a year and have a family membership. We particularly like to see the rotating exhibits over the years. The museum is very child friendly and there are many hands on activities like you would find at a children's museum. There is also a separate area, The Discovery Center, that basically functions like a small children's museum for the younger visitors. It's a great place to visit for a couple of hours but you could easily spend a full day here and still miss things. Don't miss the electricity show, the hatching baby chicks in the hall of human life, and the awesome gift shop!",

   "Visiting and seeing big dinosaurs, animals and earth. Visiting the small and big exhibition is great!! This is a place to be visited!",
   "The museum is divided by wings that 3 levels a piece. There is so much to see you need the entire time it\u2019s open if you only have 1 day. It\u2019s like 30.00 for adults and 24.00 for kids. Make sure you get a bracelet and try all the different personal quizzes. We enjoyed the live animal shows. The lighting show was pretty cool as well. Something for everyone when it comes to science. The lockers were pricy: $8.00 for one big enough to hold your back packs and jackets. There is restaurant on site. There were so many different ways to learn and explore. It\u2019s a great field trip for kids. "

   "This unique museum in the heart of the Fenway area in Boston is a must see.  It is home of a famous art heist that was never solved.  The empty frames in the museum represent the art works that were stolen.  The art work, garden, and atrium are beautiful.  The building itself is a work of art.  There is a vaired and wonderful colletcion and the volunteers are very helpful and wonderful.",
   "The documentary, \"Stolen\" by Rebecca Dreyfus told the story of Isabella Stewart Gardner and how she collected this fabulous art, and then there was the robbery in March 18, 1990. Since it's coming up on the 30 year anniversary I decided to visit this museum. Spectacular! So beautiful I took all three tours. Like visiting someone's private collection. Because it is.",
   "After long looking forward to visiting this museum I finally went on a Sunday. I left 20 minutes later disgusted. \n\nFirst of all it\u2019s very poorly lit and you can\u2019t see most of the art. There\u2019s also no markers indicating anything about each item. So you can\u2019t see them or learn anything about them?\n\nBut the worst part was there a ridiculous code policy. As you were walking in nothing indicates that coat check is mandatory or that they have any kind of a code policy. I left mine on and climb three flights of stairs. I got warm at the top so took my coat off and folded it on my arm. I was very rudely told by a staff person that they don\u2019t allow this and that I either have to wear it or tied around my waist. When I explained to him that I was too hot to wear it and that the arms are not long enough to tie around my waist, he made a rude comment about my weight.\n\nWhile I find the code policy in general to be ridiculous, they should at least have signage at the coat check about this being mandatory. and at the very least they should not hire people who are so rude to paying guests."

It's a nice place to kill an hour, and to stretch your legs.

The crew of guides are all current Naval personnel and the tour was very informative by our guide who gave the history of the commissioning of a Naval Warship and was the first Naval ship which created the U.S. Navy as known today. Launched in 1797 the guide informed visitors she is seaworthy and is launched approximately 5 times a year to sail around the Charles River - technically she could be called to active service but would be highly \nunlikely !!!\n\nThe tour is also a bonus as it is Free...",
   "We loved visiting this incredible piece of history.  There were currently enlisted marines on duty to answer questions and describe parts of the ship and its stories.  The visitor center and museum are also very much worth going to with interactive exhibits and rich information. And displays of reL artifacts and stories.  The view of the harbor is incredible, and if you go near the time of closing, stick around for 15 more minutes to hear and see the crew close the night with taps, taking down the flags, and various other things including firing a gun as the lights from the sun darken and the city lights start to brighten.  For both of these experiences I would allow at least two hours if not three.  "

You\u2019ll learn a bit is history and see the sleeping quarters and canons all while imagining a crew of 400+ on board.  Proudly displayed and beautifully preserved, it\u2019s a must stop when in Boston. ",
   "This was a great part of our trip, my husband would definitely have stayed longer but we didn't have much time in Boston.",
   "While we were in the area (Freedom Trail), we decided to check out the museum. I'm glad we did. It was quick and fun. The boat isn't very big, but it was interesting to walk around the boat and go below deck.",
   "Stopped here along our freedom trail visit.  One of the only stops that doesnt require payment.  They ask for donations.   Great info.  Nicely kept.  I have boys 10 and 8 years that loved it. ",
   "It is a very instructive museum and kids as well as adults will learn something from the visit. The personnel and the volunteers are extremely friendly helpful. I liked the display."

The Market has a lot of other sites around it, so it's a nice place to start or finish. \nIf you want to try local treats, come hungry. If you want to buy souvenirs, you can find them here. It's a one-stop experience if you're short on time.",
   "Good trip to Quincy Market, good selection of eateries and local Boston delicacies. My sister had chowder here which was fantastic. Out of season when we went, but still enjoyable and good way to try different foods.",
   "We almost skipped this because a market is a market is a market - right? I am really glad we did not. First, it is full of beautiful architecture and history - the cobblestones, the vaulted ceiling, the spiral staircases - it was a treat for the eyes. But it was also a treat for the tummy - there are so many options, we could have eaten here every day for a week and not tasted it all. And it was equally fun watching the hustle and bustle. There were performers in the areas around the market - even on a cold, blustery day. It was definitely a good investment of our time in Boston. I enjoyed it so much that I would return here on future visits. Lots to see, taste, and take in....",
   "I had a few hours to kill whilst waiting to check in for a flight.\nWhat a fabulous place, so many different smells and tastes that just tantalise the taste buds. \nThere is an array of shops that will please many (I hate shopping) and whilst I was there, there was a guy singing his heart out and really good and a couple of acrobatic guys entertaining (and jumping over) the crowd.\nA great place to spend a few hours",
   "There is always a vibe and a festive atmosphere at Quincy Market. It is always a pleasure to walk around and live the trub Bostonian life."

The cost is supposed to be $25 but the garage charged us $38 and the attendant there claimed our validation was no good. The attendant offered no solution for us and was extremely rude. We quickly let the Museum know of this issue and they were very attentive about it. I advise avoiding this parking garage but if you must park here and run into an issue make sure to let the Museum know. Here is the number for the manager at the garage, Duvante: 857-237-8756",

It doesn't have any specific shops or restaurants and in some places you will be walking through mainly residential areas.\n\nThe entire pathway is paved and clear enough for a child to ride a bicycle along the path as well.",

Good activity for an hour or two, worth it.",

The staff were very friendly and helpful and the audio device you carry around explains both the history and views as you look out over the city and surrounding areas. We had a beautiful sunny morning when we visited so could really see for miles. My daughter asked if she could use her UK student card for discount and this was easily accepted. Lots of information on how Boston was built with immigrants from all over the world, and continues this tradition now. Very poignant in today's climate.",

   "I don\u2019t think this would have been on our radar if it hadn\u2019t been for the CityPass. I went about an hour before sunset on a weekday and it was quite quiet and so we got some good views. Simple concept. The included audio guide is essential to get any real value out of the visit. However I would have liked some more skyline pictures or staff to point out things to help pick out key buildings to have made this a five star. "

Even though they were victorious, the British felt that they had lost because of the high casualties they suffered.  A great place overall.",
