  "Free cultural museum with 26 Discovery Rooms that showcase West Virginia\u2019s geology, prehistoric cultures, exploration and settlement, frontier conflicts and life...statehood, railroad, coal company town, mining,... the Great Depression, Civil Rights movement...transportation, fairs and festivals, cultural state collections and famous West Virginians. Very well done with extensive and interesting displays about West Virginia\u2019s history and culture. Conveniently located next to the capital building.",
  "We loved this wonderful, free museum that had a little bit of everything.  There was a coal mine, stories and pictures of the Hatfields and the McCoys, dresses from the various Miss West Virginia Beauty Pageants or the ball gowns from wives of the various governors, so much interesting history like the story of John Brown's Raid.  This is a must see place to go and you might want to return a couple of times in order to see it all.  ",
  "I was pleasantly surprised at how well done this museum is.  Great exhibits, free, and a ton of West Virginia history!  A must see!",
  "West Virginia state museum is the best museum I have ever been to, All cities states countries whatever should have the same type of museum that they have here it\u2019s interactive entertaining well thought out well laid out it\u2019s a fantastic experience if you ever come to West Virginia this is something you definitely want to walk through.",
  "Wear comfortable shoes because this museum is large and packed with awesome exhibits. It is laid out so well and there ate some interactive displays along the way. I actually went back a second time to finish seeing it all. Plan on 2- 3 hours to really look at it all. You could take longer. Free and open every day. Parking is a little bit of a walk but not bad. Bring change for the meter.",
  "The kids ages 9 and 11 really enjoyed the museum. When we first arrived we grabbed the museum's scavenger hunt and after that we did the geocache hunt. I think the geocache hunt is what got my 9 year old really into the exhibits. The exhibits are beautifully done, but he likes to find treasure at the end. He said he felt like a detective. I think there was only one other person in the museum while we were there. There was a lot of staff present. The place is sparkling clean. We spent almost all day here.",
  "It is not easy to impress a history geek and museum cutator. That said... I fell in love immediately. The variety of items, the quality of displays and the docents were top notch. The experience of West Virginia becoming a state and the storytelling of it was fun and a great learning experience. Best of all it is free, self paced and in an amazingly cool space! I plan on coming back soon!",
  "The long history of West Virginia begins eons ago with geological artifacts. The whole story is told with many interactive rooms. Each of the rooms covers a different aspect of a time or the people up to the present. There are many, many artifacts to take in and kiosks of written explanations to help one understand what is being displayed. We are not from West Virginia but enjoyed learning about the state and the people of the state. In some of the displays the lighting was insufficient and and some of the displays could be updated. There is no admission charged for this museum but there is a value to visiting it."

  "Every May for about the past 10 years we have visited WV and we make sure to always see the capitol building.  During the week you can have a guided tour of the inside and it is a good tour.  This year we got there around 5PM and just strolled the grounds.  The flowers are beautiful. The statuary is amazing,  Our favorite is the WV coal miner.  We also visit the war memorial each year--WWI, WWII, Korean War, and Vietnam War and the list of names.  Thank you for remembering.",
  "The Gold dome is actually painted with gold leaf and very unique in that it stands on the bank of the Great Kanawha River and where it can be viewed from the river or Interstate 64 which is just a few blocks away.",
  "The West Virginia capitol is a beautiful building with lots of marble and special features.  It has a unique dome that is blue with gold leaf. It was opened in 1932, so it doesn't have as much of a historical feel as some state capitols, but it is well worth a visit.",
  "I'm amazed at the true beauty of our Capitol.  Parking isn't great but it's worth a walk from a neighboring street to go into the atrium.  The lawn is beautiful as well!",
  "I say \"unexpectedly\" because visitors tend to under rate West Virginia, but the capitol (part of a multi-building complex which includes the Culture Center) is a gem.  It was designed by Cass Gilbert, who also designed the capitol in Washington, DC.  The surrounding statuary is marvelous - especially the one of Abraham Lincoln on the south front. If you go, wear shock-absorbing shoes - the floors are marble.  And be careful on the stairs!  There is a cafeteria, which in my experience has ranged from very good to mediocre to closed.  At the moment, I am told it is back to being good.  If you have a camera with a long lens, shoot for the detail way up high on the building.  Public access is now restricted to two entry points with metal detectors.",
  "We were traveling to North Carolina and stopped to stretch legs.  It is an amazing capitol.  We were able to have a personal tour.  I really enjoyed our visit.  Don't forget to visit the state museum in the complex!",
  "Walking through the Capitol building was a wonderful experience.  Walking down the marble hallways looking at the artwork on the walls.  Seeing the young children on tour with their classmates learning all they can. It\u2019s definitely a place that you want to stop in and see.",
  "A fan of state capitols, I seized the opportunity to tour West Virginia\u2019s while in Charleston.  The decor is impressive with marble flooring and walls, delicately engraved flowers made of West Virginian woods throughout the legislative chambers and waiting rooms.  Do not miss the Austrian crystal chandeliers in the House and Senate chambers and the Bohemian one in the Governor\u2019s Reception Room.  While not the most ostentatious state capitol I have toured, it is worth a visit.\n\nWe enjoyed watching both the House and Senate in session.  The tour guide was very informative.  I am glad I took the tour.",
  "I would have rated this place terrible but it is the state capitol.  Where is the security to keep people from making this place smell like urine.  The only other place i have been that smells like strong urine is in DC.  And what is up with the workers not finishing the gilding on the dome?  Who is in charge of these people.  We have one of the most beautiful capitols in the nation and for it to be disrespected like this.  What a shame.  Won't be coming here again.",
  "We love visiting state capitols so I wanted to be sure to see this one. I was at first disappointed that it was undergoing remodeling of the dome but glad we went inside because it was very pretty. Upstairs the Senate and House were both open to the public and they had beautiful chandeliers. Each room had a large great room before you entered it with enormous  black and white historical murals. Also, I loved the old fashioned doors and doorknobs reminding me of the 1950s or earlier. The Governor\u2019s Office had its door wide open as if to send a message all were welcome! We enjoyed it! ",

  "We have been to the Clay Center numerous times but only for concerts, shows and gorgeous weddings. This was a first with a toddler and taking him to the youth exhibits. The \"My Town\", \"Water Works\" room, Healthy Me and the Music Studio...Wow!  So much to see and do for all ages! Plus a very cool climbing structure in the middle of the lobby. My Town has little stores and shops and offices...a grocery store, doctors office, diner, veterinarian office, big fire truck...and so much more! The Water Works is a big room with a couple of very cool hands on water features. We highly recommend stopping in...even if you don't have children! (it's fun to watch them) \nEven though there were 3 school bus loads of kids, it really wasn't that crowded as there is so much to do...not one area was too crowded.",
  "My husband and I and another couple recently attended a live performance of Mountain Stage at the Clay Center.  What a beautiful venue and the acoustics for live music was awesome!  Really enjoyed the show.",
  ".....\u2026I was rather struck by the fact that it appeared to have an art museum attached \u2013 the Juliet Art Museum, so I ventured in and this is what I found: a large, 2nd floor open-plan gallery, with quite an extensive hang of themed paintings \u2013 people, places and so on - and amongst the usual dreary dross there are some wonderful treasures. These include one of the earliest portraits known to have been painted in America, one of only two dozen colonial works to have survived. It is actually quite good for the time and place, is a gem and worth seeing. They have a good Nathaniel Hone, a founder member of London\u2019s Royal Academy, of a portrait of the lawyer Charles Lossett. Of their later things they have a truly beautiful and atmospheric watercolour by John Singer Sargent of pine woods and though it is easy to be disparaging about any local art museum\u2019s home collection, the work of West Virginian artist Barry Vance is very fine \u2013 plein air painting in the Impressionist tradition, landed in the local hills and mountains.\n \nIncidentally, the two tavern scenes are nothing to do with Dutch 17thC art, but are 19thC copies after the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger \u2013 just so you know.\n \nAltogether a real gem and worth a detour.",
  "What a great venue for a concert/ choir/ band show!! \nAwesome auditorium with wonderful seating and sound! \nWe could do but they have museum/ discovery center and whole additional part for families and cost just $9 adults and less for kids.. great bang for the buck for afternoon of fun!",
  "My boys love this place. So many things to keep their minds busy and thier imagination soaring. I definitely recommend this place.",
  "Interesting, fun displays with lots of sensory experiences. Planetarium was amazing and the presenter also showed us the positions of stars etc in the sky in the part of Scotland where we had travelled from !  Had almost 5  hours there but would have liked more time.  Just vending machines  - no cafe; helpful staff gave us directions where to eat nearby, but we were enjoying ourselves too much to leave. A packed lunch would have good.",
  "I thought I was going to an art museum, but their art collection is 4 paintings. However, they have a nice chidren's museum with water, music and human body rooms. There is an amazing climbing structure as well. I enjoyed the children's displays.",
  "We were surprised at the variety of shops & restaurants here, as well as the extensive parking facility should you be driving. We were fortunate enough to walk her from our hotel-so, yes, there are also hotels at City Center"

  "Omgoodness- what a fab place to visit and shop or find a cozy outside seat and relax with the sights of a Farmers Market \nInside you will find food, beer, wine, sushi, meat market offering organic selections, fish,  fresh chocolate delights, market fruits and veggies and dried beans , spices, wv crafts, glassware and wv food products\u2014\u2014-just to name a few of the indoor offerings. \nOutdoors are local farmers with their booths filled with fresh products, micro greens, flowers and herbs, icecream by Ellen\u2019s icecream , at times music  and activities, seats to enjoy delights and relaxation, and a restaurant at one end that offers outside seating. \nIt is like a little city encased in this wonderful market. \nA definite must see while visiting Charleston",
  "This market has so many offerings including outdoor local fruit and vegetable vendors and indoor local products as well as a butcher shop, coffee shop, wine shop, restaurants and year round produce.  Take time to enjoy it all.",
  "No matter the season, this quaint market is one of Charleston's finest places to visit. Outside, you can find fresh flowers, plants and produce in season from many local vendors. Inside, you'll find delicious food at the SoHo restaurant along with several local shops with locally-made wines, cheeses, fresh meat, seafood, books, West Virginia souvenirs and some of the finest chocolate you will ever eat (Holls). The Purple Onion is the perfect place to find fresh, reasonably-priced produce and other interesting food items.",
  "Love going to the Capitol Market when in Charleston WV.  A variety of vendors and market items as well as a couple of great eateries make this a great place to while away some time in the city and pick up something you'll love. And it has a wonderful atmosphere and vibe. It can be hot in the summer so go early to beat the heat. Walk through their wide offering of live plants and have a crab cake sandwich at the little seafood eatery!  They also offer fresh produce and foods, wine, chocolates and books. Recommend visiting! Enjoyable!  ",
  "Spring is coming to Charleston and the capital market will be full of bedding plants for gardens and annuals for containers. Herbs will go into gardens and color will return to window boxes. Local farmers will begin to sell lettuce and small bushes for early planting. Great place to go on a weekend. Get there early for the best selection and a parking place.",
  "A must stop for a Capital City visit.  Both an open air and enclosed market offering true West Virginia made products.\n\nAn excellent restaurant is available for lunch\n\nAllow 60-90 minutes for a visit.  Parking is available ",
  "Cute farmers market with multiple shops, crafts and places to eat! Worth a stop and would even be better in summer with outdoor markets!",
  "The Capitol Market is a true gem in Charleston. We are so lucky to have fresh farm vegetables, a traditional butcher, a sushi shop, Holls chocolates, a seafood stand, the wine shoppe and SoHos restaurant all under one roof\u2014 and the flowers Spring through summer are gorgeous, and winter brings evergreens in all forms!! Don\u2019t miss visiting here if you are in Charleston!",
  "My mother and I stopped here for lunch and split a reuben and another sandwich at soho's.  The reuben was excellent.  Parking at the market is free.  The place seems clean.  We saw some apparent homeless people but they didn't harass us like in other parts of Charleston.  You can find fresh produce, meats, wines, cheese, candy, etc. but the prices are high, so we didn't buy anything even though we could have used some fresh fruit and meat.",
  "Love the Purple Onion, and the Wine and Cheese Market, The Seafood Market!! All of the Shops are 5 Stars!",
  "good place for locally sourced food, particular during the summer. They have a decent wine shop, coffee shop, There is a quality meat shop there, where you can also get lunch. You can pick up WV gifts there."

  "In the 70s, before the mall came to town, this was the place to be in Charleston. \n\nFor years, it was run-down and desolate. \n\nSince the 90s, Capitol Street has bounced back and is the place to be again!\n\nEllen's Ice Cream, Taylor Books, The Block, Adelphia, Bar 101, Sam's Uptown Cafe, Pies and Pints. \n\nSomething to do there from dawn until well into the night. \n\nCheck out ArtWalk! ",
  "Visiting Capitol Street is a must if in downtown Charleston;  bars, restaurants, and shops abound here.  Most are worth visiting on their own merits;  having everything in a couple-block area makes for a very walkable evening or afternoon!",
  "I loved this area, it was so clean and pictureques, the entire street boast of family friendly restaurants and little eateries. we ate at Pie and Pints which served the best handmade pizzas ever, all fresh ingredients and next door is Adelphis which was also a very nice place to eat good mix of american food and catch the game as it was a sports bar atmosphere. last but not least is the ice cream parlour just across the street with its home made ice creams. The street is quiet and peaceful! beautiful ",
  "If it were a nice day, a cup of coffee or a scoop of ice cream would be a good go to... Don't miss the Peanut Shoppe ( weekdays only).  Some nice folks, some not.  Don't get too excited about this street, even though it's one of our best.",
  "Good spots to eat and drink and shop. Trolley will get you around and parking is seriously cheap. It's a downtown street, so you do have to experience some colorful characters.",
  "If you want to go here to eat or shop or walk, park somewhere else (May I suggest up by Capitol Market if it's during the day, or down on the river otherwise?) because you won't even be able to find a space here except by the grace of the parking fairies.\n\nAlso for confused natives and a handful of people reading brochures put out by the city of Charleston, for some reason the brochures are now calling this area \"Renaissance Village\".  Please don't ask locals about \"Renaissance Village\", we don't know what you're talking about as the Visitor's Bureau didn't tell anyone they were giving downtown a name\n\nAnyway.  Attractions include:\nCapitol Market (at the very end)\nCharleston Bakery\nDaniel Boone Inn (not much to do, but it is pretty)\nBear's Den\nSwiftwater Cafe\nHenry Gassaway David Park\nGrazziano's\nEllen's\nTaylor's Bookstore\nPies and Pints\nAdelphia's\nThe Peanut Shoppe\nThe Library\nIchiban\nand a slew of bars closer to the river.",
  "Charming Capitol Street! We visited in the evening and look forward to coming back during the daytime as well. It was more populated than we expected on a chilly Fall night. Our favorite was Taylor's Bookstore and Ellen's Ice cream. Pretty street for a stroll anytime of day.",
  "We love the architecture and feel of Capitol Street. It has such character that suburban shopping areas lack. There\u2019s Pies and Pints, Ellen\u2019s Ice cream, Taylor Books and coffee plus a number of other options as you stroll down this historic street. For those of us who miss that downtown shopping feel of the past this is a must.",
  "This is beautiful section of downtown Charleston, WV and has a feel of New Orleans, LA or old Savannah, GA.  The tree-lined streets are wonderful and there are a lot of festivals and things to do. The restaurants and entertainment venues are quaint and fun. Come visit Charleston, WV (Charlie West) for those flying into Yeager Airport and enjoy the river and quaint downtown.\n",
  "Capitol Street used to be the main shopping street in Charleston, but most of the big chain stores have moved out.  Now the street is lined with trees and has great small shops and gift shops.  We visited a book store, an ice cream shop, a jewelry store, a novelty shop, and a restaurant.  Park in the parking garage that is central to all of it.  Great fun browsing the many and varied shops.",
  "Heart of it all. Bars and restaurants line the street and the choice is up to you. Its a great part of Downtown and all is in walking distance in just 3 or 4 blocks. Very safe!"

  "Each time that I visit the Culture Center, I am reminded of the rich simplicities of life that are often forgotten or put on the backburner for sometimes cold and empty technological advances.\n\nOver the years, my family and I have grown to appreciate the beauty of the local artisans on display with paintings, sculptures, quilts; the diversity in musical selections, and the enormous archived resources available in the library. \n\nThere is a very satisfying and refreshing feeling that you leave with anytime that you visit The Culture Center.",
  "The correct name is \"Culture Center\" -- it's not how I would have labeled it but it is what it is.  \nThere are always great displays in the lobby, several series of lectures during the month, a really good state museum, and sometimes you stumble onto special events there, if you're lucky.\nThe Culture Center is home to \"Mountain Stage\" -- the public radio show heard across the country and on Armed Forces Radio around the world.\nCheck it out!",
  "Mountain Stage brings live music from around the country and world to West Virginia. This is a fantastic and intimate venue and the line ups are always amazing. Joanie D is fantastic.",
  "See my review under 'State Museum' for details.  It does include a great quilt collection and small gift shop.  Don't miss the engraved state history carved into the granite walls to the right of the main entrance and around the right outside of the building.",
  "Although parking is a little confusing with the legislature in session, a trip to the Culture Center and Museum is well worth it. (especially since its free). Its close to the interstate and sits on the capitol's grounds. There were a lot of newer exhibits since I was last there but my favorite is still the lifelike coal mine. Lots of kids there today that were filling out scavenger hunts.",
  "The lower level of the Culture Center is a masterpiece museum of West Virginia's long and curious history, going back to the eons ago when it was south of the equator. Prepare to be amazed, and don't schedule less than an hour. You could easily spend 3 hours and miss half of what is there to be revealed. And you find something that surprises you, for sure. ",
  "It is closed I think on Mondays so find out before you head that way.\nParking is at meter parking, unless its i think its on the weekend.",
  "Located on the State Capitol grounds it is a must see stop for visitors to the Mountain State. The exhibits change periodically, but the message is to tell the history of the State and to show case current artists and craftsmen. It also gives one and opportunity to view a Cass Gilbert designed State Capitol building located next to the Culture Center.",
  "We weren't sure what to expect, but the entire experience was excellent. We were greeted by a nice person who told us about the different floors and exhibits. Completely enjoyed learning more about West Virginia.",
  "For finding out more about West Virginia, this is the place to go.  Beautiful, well-laid out exhibits.  Plan to spend some time here as it is worth it.  A beautiful, clean place.",
  "I went to visit The Culture Center in Charleston to do my family research and I found a lot of interesting facts about WV. My visit turned into a tour because I was fascinated by the deep culture that is hidden in WV. "

  "We went on the first day hike on New Years Day and it was great. We will be receiving a patch in the mail for doing it which is cute, and our guide was great, everyone was very nice. ",
  "My son and I spent a restful weekend tent camping in early spring. We found a wonderful site (#45) near the mountain stream that goes through the campground. It was a bit cold (40's at night), so we were the only campers, but it made for a quiet and relaxing stay. The campground attendant was friendly and made sure we had enough wood. This seems to be a popular park for mountain bikers, hikers and picnickers. The one trail we hiked on Sunday afternoon was near the campground (Pine Ridge Trail) and led us up the high hill that borders the long, narrow camping area.\nThe drive up to the entrance is a winding, narrow, paved road that has one hairpin curve. But it's worth it to get to this wonderful forest area. From the campground, it's about a 30-minute drive to get to the nearest Kroger. \nI could not get cell phone service in the campground--which was a good thing for this trip. There was limited wi-fi service at the bath house for an occasional weather update. If you like to be away from civilization, this is a great place to recalibrate and relax.",
  "This little gem is close to Charleston and offers camping, picnics, hiking trails, biking trails and fishing pong for kids.  Very beautiful place!!!",
  "There is a local hiking group that organizes hikes every weekend.  I recommend going if you get a chance.",
  "We went on the first day hike on New Years Day and it was great. We will be receiving a patch in the mail for doing it which is cute, and our guide was great, everyone was very nice. ",
  "We drove to this park while exploring the area looking for scenic areas to take pictures of. We found this to be the prettiest by far. At one spot they had a nice loop nature trail with an abundance of interpretive signage. We had visited another park earlier and wished we had come here first as it was far prettier and more natural. ",
  "We camped at Site 27 for two nights, absolutely loved it!! Clean, quiet and level. We hiked a few of gorgeous trails. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We can't wait camp at this park again. We traveled from Florida.",
  "Disappointed there was nowhere to swim, but overall really enjoyed the park. Staff was super helpful. \n"

The memorial is beautiful with the statues of soldiers and sailors of WWl, WWll, Korean War and Viet Nam wars. The memorial is tear wrenching--all those names all those lives lost.  I believe the pool represents all our tears.  Thank you for remembering.",

I did notice the Sears store is closing.  The Hallmark Store was one of the nicest I have ever been in. We wish we would have had more time to explore the facility. \n",

Dying a slow death like all malls, lots of vacant stores, not many people even considering it was right after Christmas. It's a lovely building, glass elevator and 3 terraced floors. Hope the owners can turn it into some type of community rec center, there doesn't to be much going on in Charleston WV in the winter months. Good luck though",

  "The Criel Mound is a Native American burial mound located in South Charleston, WV. The mound was built by the Adena culture, around 250\u2013150 BC. A prior excavation by the Smithsonian Institution located 13 skeletons inside.\n\u2724\nThis was my first experience at a Native American burial mound and it was better than I could have hoped. This mound is located in the heart of South Charleston but is easy to get to, with parking right in front of it. There are two staircases set into the mound with long, generous steps that follow the gentle curvature of the mount up to its summit. From the top, you have a nice view of the surrounding neighborhood. Never once did we feel unsafe in the area and we could see our car the entire time. The size of the mound is impressive too! \n\u2724\nMy experience at this mound has made me want to visit other mounds in the region and explore the history of the mound-building cultures that inhabited the surrounding valleys, so kudos to this simple mound for inspiring so much interest! ",
  "If you like history and are in Charleston, or just passing through, this is a really cool spot.  It is an ancient Adena Indian burial mound.  The park around the mound is beautiful and they have several displays giving you the history of the people, their culture and information about the mound.  There are several restaurants close by.

It is just a big statue with some information about the Big Boy burgers on it.  It literally took us 5 minutes, but for a quick quirky fun place to stop, this worked.  And we've never eaten at one-not sure where they are but not in Iowa.",
  "This is a quick roadside attraction on the west side of Charleston. (Address is NOT correct here) as it is on Kanawha Blvd W, not East. \n\nThe \"museum\" is a few windows of history about Shoney's Big Boy as this was the site of the original. It's a nice tribute, but only really interesting to those that remember it.  ",
  "It is not a museum...very much a shrine to days gone by. It is a pillar/plinth of sorts with a Big Boy on top. Around the base is information regarding the foundation of both businesses and the link between them.",
  "This is basically a small shrine to Shoney's. There is column with a BIg Boy on top and a plaque with the history of the restaurant below as well as some pictures. Interesting to see if you are in the area."

  "We had just passed thru Kentucky and were about 6 miles into West Virginia on Highway 64 when we saw the Visitors Center.  Since we were headed for our first trip to West Virginia and weren't sure what to see and do, we were fortunate that Gwen Knoll and Jacob Paxton were working there that day because they were both so helpful.  They gave us maps and highlighted places that we would be interested in seeing near Charleston (where we would be staying).  We walked out of there with a wealth of information about the area, and we took their advice -  visiting all the great places that they told us about.  How lucky for us that they were still open when we arrived because it was getting late in the day!",
  "Our questions were answered thoroughly and we were given great suggestions for entertainment.  Very pleasant.",
  "Needing to stop and take it all in, we decided to stop at the visitor center and get the necessary information for our stay in W. VA.  The attendants were very helpful and the maps guided us through the town.",
  "They offer a nice selection of state and local information.  Located in the Capitol Market is a big plus. Grab some treats before hitting the road!"

  "Cato Park is a nice small park in Charleston. It has hills and hiking trails. It has hills and wild deer. The 9-hole golf course needs work, but it is a municipal and therefore with minimum funding.",
  "This is not the best park in Charleston, Coonskin is much better.  It has a small playground for kids and a golf course.",
  "We had this little gem all to ourselves as it was a brisk Sunday morning.  I enjoyed the drive to Cato Park, viewing all the beautiful and historic houses along the way.  What a great place to bring one's dog as there are doggie disposal stations around the course.",
  "Not  for those on the PGA tour but fun to play, and not very expensive. Pools are very nice, in the summer. Several tennis courts are available. The park is easy to access, not far off the interstates. ",
  "Named after the benefactor Judge Cato.  He had a camp in St Albans near my mothers beach and would visit with my family often and he always attended my sister Luana's birthday parties and he would dance with Luana "

  "Very friendly members and nice dignified service.  Upbeat sermon and with audience participation through well selected Bible passages. .(When I was there the choice was a lovely portion of Proverbs)  A very pleasant and thoughtful service.  One of the best choirs I've ever heard and highlighted by powerful piano and organ music, and just a little offering of beautifully executed bell ringing. The place to spend your Sunday morning if your visiting.",
  "The Baptist Temple (American Baptist Convention) is a beautiful, well-maintained, traditional church located at the western end of the Historical East End District.  It is large, physically, and the welcome you will find inside is equally large.  The music is outstanding, and the organ magnificent.  Child care is available during Sunday School and church services.  There are several child/youth programs.  Members of the church are actively involved in outreach programs, and support a large number of local organizations.  Entertainment is frequently presented in the Fellowship Hall.",
  "The facility was a beautiful building built in the early\n1900's.  The service was uplifting!  Message and music was well received.",
  "I have been away from my home church and just needed some christian company. I was treated like a long lost relative the people were friendly and helpful. the service was nice and the choir fabulous. I will surely visit agai if I am still here on Sunday!",

  "This park has a great bike trail and a playground and on the river.  There is free splash park but the water wasn\u2019t on, which made the park a little less than magical. We could not figure out how to turn on the water, several families came while we were there with hopes of the water being on, there are bathrooms which is a bonus! Enough to do to spend 30 minutes if you didn\u2019t bring your bikes.",
  "If you wonder why the park is referred to as Magic Island it is because often it submerges underneath the Kanawha River during high waters. Not much is there but it does make for a nice walk by the river. Often during different seasons events will be held there.",
  "This park was an Island built along the Kanahwa river.  It is scenic and has play equipment for both children and adults."

  "I have enjoyed the performances of the WVSO for more than ten years, and it gets better and better.  Under Maestro Grant Cooper both the musicianship and the programming improved dramatically.  When the symphony moved into the Clay Center it found an acoustically superb performance space.  There is an extensive education component and concerts are offered in locations outside Charleston.  The symphony is now selecting its next music director and there is every prospect that it will continue to excel.",
  "We went to see the Nutcracker and it was wonderful.  The music was just lush and captivating.  My entire family loved the performance and the seating at the Clay Center is great.",
  "I always greatly enjoy the Symphony when I am able to attend.  They put on some wonderful performances and are very professional.  Nothing second class about them at all.  If you enjoy great classical music by very talented people, I suggest you go to one of their performances soon.",
  "The WV Symphony Orchestra is outstanding and the Maestro is innovative and creative.  He often creates arrangements for fun.  At Christmas he arranged The Twelve Days of Christmas with a different composer style for each \"day\". Great fun to try to guess each one.  The answers were available on their website",
  "For a city this size, this is a great orchestra. The symphony's home is the Clay Center which is a lovely venue with great acoustics. "

  "Visited the T-Rex Science Center today to check it out before taking our grandchildren.\nGreat displays of several dinosaurs and fossils. Also has several stations for children to participate in learning activities. There was a Paleontologist who was available for q and a if needed. As I understand the Museum will be moving to Bigley Avenue later this year to a larger facility. The curator has a great passion to make available this learning experience for WV  children and their family. We are members of the Clay Center. Would be a great fit to partner this learning center with the Clay Center. Also has a well stocked gift shop and you can even have Birthday parties there also."
