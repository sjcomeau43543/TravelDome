  "Located right in Hartford, but tucked away in it's own little area, the Mark Twain house is a must see if you are in the area. It's available only by prebooked tour, and they do book up ahead of time so purchase tickets before driving out there. The cost of an adult ticket is $20, which seemed a little pricey until we were on the tour, and it quickly became apparent the price is worth it. Our tour guide Brendan was phenomenal, his knowledge of the history of both Mark Twain and the house itself was unmatched. The house is rich in history and was very advanced for its time, including having one of the first residential telephones which is still there today. The tour takes about 60-90 minutes, and then plan an extra 20-30 for time at the museum and gift shop.",
  "Stephanie lead us on an interesting and lively tour that really brought Samuel Clemens, his wife, his family, his friends, and the time in which they lived, to life as we visited this exquisite home. The house is decorated for Christmas now too.",
  "The Mark Twain House and Museum is an astonishing architectural, historical and literary gem in the middle of old Hartford--a few steps from downtown and right next to the Harriet Beecher Stowe House. Beautifully restored, the experience of seeing Twain's library and writing rooms, learning about his life and his times from the brilliantly erudite staff and volunteers makes this an essential stop when you're in New England. Take one of the tours!",
  "What a great tour! We learned a lot about the house and the purpose of each room. To see the top floor, the room where Twain\u2019s most popular novels were written, was incredible. Definitely worth a visit. The house is gorgeous and tastefully decorated. Great to see and to learn!",
  "This visit to the house was for a special event; the Sea Tea Improv Players were entertaining us as Twain characters in a very unique game of \u201cClue\u201d, utilizing the house for each room in the game. Participants were led by our guide who established the details of the crime, in this case the murder of Pap Finn, Huckleberry Finn\u2019s father, and led us \u201cthe detectives\u201d around the home to obtain clues to figure out who, with what and where. Along the way, we were treated to factual detail about the house and a great deal of the history of the Twain family. As this was a nighttime activity, it also served as a great opportunity to view the home when it was dark outside giving a whole new perspective. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this creative approach to familiarizing ourselves with Mark Twain, the entire family and of course the architectural masterpiece that was the family home. The improv troupe did a spectacular job at re-creating the Twain characters\u2014 bravo!\n\nThis historic landmark continues to present wonderful activities above and beyond just a house tour to thrill the whole community. One of my very favorite places.....",
  "I was in CT for a business trip and my flight got delayed by half a day. So, I looked on Trip Advisor for attractions in Hartford. I was happy I found the Mark Twain House and did a tour.\n\nIf you visit, I highly recommend showing up 30 minutes earlier so you can watch the movie about his life.  The tour guide will go through a lot of details about Mark Twain and his family but it sure did help put the pieces together because I had watch the 20 minute film.\n\nThe house is just absolutely beautiful, inside and out. It was very cool t me to see where Mark Twain sat and wrote his novels.",
  "I love this place. The house is amazingly ornate in the Stick style with hand-stenciled wallpaper, cathedral vaulted ceilings, not what you would expect from the man who wrote Roughing It. (His study is much less designed to impress). Learning about the family and servants is fun and the guides are always so informed and attuned to how much the group wants to know (some people like to look. Some want to know everything). I would advise that if you find climbing difficult, though, there are lots of stairs, but the guides pull out folding chairs for you if you need a break. And Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s house is right next door!",
  "visited here with our granddaughter (12) and had a great tour which last about one hour and 45 minutes. In addition there are several galleries dedicated to Twain and Hal Holbrooke. Also a short film.\nwe toured every room in the house and climbed 41 plus stairs. enjoyed every moment and would suggest this if you have never been"

  "My husband and I have visited the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut, multiple times, most recently on Sunday, December 1st, 2019. This museum, which is definitely worth visiting and highly recommended, has a great mixture of various types of artwork, addressing art from multiple perspectives, including cultural, historical and political, depending upon what is applicable. Our primary focus this time was on the annual \u201cFestival of Trees\u201d exhibit, which was quite exquisite and enjoyable, and the other special exhibits. I addressed these exhibits below. However, we also visited the permanent exhibits. All the art throughout this museum is nicely curated with very good write-ups providing excellent supporting background information with great details.\n\nWe always enjoy this museum and hope that you have the opportunity to enjoy it as well. We only wish we had more time to see all this museum has to offer, which definitely is quite a bit!!\n\nOur visit to the museum took about an hour and a half, based on the amount of time available to us. However, it could easily have taken more than four hours to really see and absorb all the artwork that was on display. We parked on the street on the side of the Hartford Public Library for this visit. This parking was free on Sunday there, and was a short walk to and from the museum. There was also validated parking for a $3 flat rate for museum visitors at the Front Street South Garage, GPS Address \u2013 62 Front Street Crossing, Hartford. Your local library may have passes for free admission into this museum, except you still will have to pay $3 for the \u201cFestival of Trees\u201d exhibit, which currently is scheduled to end on December 8th..\n\nSpecial Exhibits:\n\nThe \u201cFestival of Trees\u201d, which we have visited over the past several years, was located in multiple galleries on the first floor and was nicely laid out. All the trees and wreaths were decorated quite beautifully. In particular, we were quite impressed with the trees in the Great Hall, which were a nice addition to the artwork in this gallery. We also enjoyed the many pieces built from Legos, which were quite impressive. A lot of hard work definitely went into building these masterpieces made out of Legos. The only drawback about the \u201cFestival of Trees\u2019 exhibit was that there appeared to be less trees and wreathes than in the past.\n\nThe special exhibit \u201cMathematics of Elegance: An Icon of Early Connecticut Furniture\u2019 was quite educational, providing very good historical context and helped us better understand and appreciate  cabinetmaking, its associated architecture, and its connection to Mathematics. It was interesting to find out how Ancient Greek and Roman influences in the areas of proportion and geometry guided design in Western art and architecture. Also, how artists and artisans in Colonial America used classical architecture, with emphasis on symmetry, in their designs and in their notions of beauty and harmony was interesting. Greek and Roman systems identified by their column style: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite were nicely depicted in the exhibit. How early cabinetmakers used these systems in proportion with just a compass, straight edge and paper was quite impressive. Will Neptune\u2019s depiction of the alignment between the cabinetmaker Eliphalet Chapin\u2019s design process used in his elegantly proportioned high chest of drawers and the ancient Greek and Roman classical architectural order was very insightful. It illustrates an informative and interesting way to see how art, architecture and mathematics all align..    .  \n\nAlso, within this exhibit, the background information on the East Windsor-based cabinetmaker Eliphalet Chapin (1741- 1807) and his use of the Rococo Style with delicate, naturalistic ornamentation was quite interesting.  His sophisticated understanding of proportion, and use of geometric construction techniques in the designs of his exceptional furniture was quite impressive.  Even though the exhibit was relatively small in size, it definitely was a very good learning experience, \n\nThe special exhibit \u2018Afro cosmologies American Reflection\u2019 was laid out in multiple galleries and was quite unique.  Within the exhibit Cosmology is defined as a continuing body of beliefs that incorporates the centrality of nature, ritual and relationships between the human and divine with many influences that shape Contemporary Art. Topics addressed within the exhibit include: Ritual shared worship experiences; affirming new identities, communities and commitment to freedom; and Gods and Humanity depicting our relationship to specific gods, and how our interactions with spirits and ancestors are defining part of daily life. This was definitely a different type of Contemporary Art exhibit and was interesting.  \n\nThere were also multiple other special exhibits that we only had a short time to walk-through and explore.  There were some very interesting artifacts and detailed write-ups describing the artifacts within these exhibits, which were definitely worth seeing.  These included \u2018The Sport and Leisure: Sailing on the Sound\u2019, \u2018Design in the American Home, 1650 to 1850\u2019 and \u2018Tradition and the Avant-Garde: Highlights of Ballets Russes Design\u2019 among other exhibits.  \n.  \nPermanent Exhibits:\n\nDuring our visit, as we have done in the past, we also enjoyed the permanent exhibits on European and American Art. The American Art featured a great collection of American Decorative Arts, Colonial America pieces, Hudson River School paintings, Impressionist pieces, the Samuel Colt Collection and the exquisite Goodwin Parlor. The Hudson River School paintings included multiple impressive landscape paintings by world renowned artists who followed the unique Hudson River School approach, which has always been one of our favorites. We also enjoyed the large collection of Baroque Art as well as the other European Art from the French Revolution, Neoclassical, Romantic, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movements and the artwork in the Great Hall presented in salon style. In addition, we like the early Chinese, Japanese, Greek, Egyptian, Roman, Medieval and Renaissance Art Objects when they are on display. The write-ups about all this artwork were very detailed and informative, including information on their time period and cultural, historical and political impact.\n\nAgain, we recommend this museum and hope that you have the opportunity to enjoy it as much as we have for a great mixture of various types of artwork.",
  "Very Impressive Mixture of Various Types of Art in Both the Special and Permanent Exhibits\n\nMy husband and I have visited the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Connecticut, multiple times, most recently on Sunday, December 9, 2018.

In particular, we were quite impressed with the trees in the Great Hall, which were a nice addition to the artwork in this gallery.\n\nThe special exhibit \u201cMonsters and Myths: Surrealism and War in the 1930s and 1940s\", was quite interesting, unique and very educational.  It was a good lesson in history.  Hartford\u2019s role in embracing Surrealism, in particular the Wadsworth\u2019s role, was nicely illustrated.  Surrealism\u2019s purpose to revolutionize society through artmaking beyond reality was portrayed. \n\nMultiple subject areas and aspects of Surrealism were presented, including the Emergence of Monsters, depicting the horrors of war; the influence of the Civil War in Spain, the impact of Dislocation and War World II; and Survival and Renewal: Surrealism in America.  These areas were nicely presented with well written overviews providing definitions and good background information as well as good examples of artwork by multiple well renowned artists.  The artwork featured very unique pieces by Salvador Dali, such as the \u2018Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach,\u2019   which had many types of interesting images incorporated into it. The explanation that Surrealism can be understood historically only in relation to war provided good insight into this type of art for me.  This exhibit helped me develop an appreciation for Surrealism and was definitely worth seeing, being well laid out and nicely done.     \n\nThe special exhibit \u2018Bed Furnishings in Early America: An Intimate Look\u2019 depicted the significant role the bed played in life\u2019s daily cycles of early America. This included its evolution and cultural exchange impact, among other unique aspects.  The exhibit featured interesting subjects, including \u2018Snug in a Bed Rug\u2019 where rugs were used on beds instead of as floor coverings.  The rugs and quilts that were on display within the exhibit were impressively crafted, with great examples of handwork reflecting the textile making skills of talented artisans.  The Crewel Work, embroidery using worsted yarn, was quite beautiful.  The overviews and detailed write-ups within this exhibit were also quite informative and provided a good historical perspective, including how beds and bedding were related to social status, financial stability and age. This exhibit was definitely interesting and quite unique. \n\n  \nPermanent Exhibits:\n\nDuring our visit, as we have done in the past, we also enjoyed the permanent exhibits on European and American Art.  The American Art featured a great collection of American Decorative Arts, Colonial America pieces, Hudson River School paintings, Impressionist pieces, the Samuel Colt Collection and the exquisite Wetmore Parlor.

  "This museum has something for everyone,  children's activities to keep their interest while viewing, a wide  variety  of artists , great traveling exhibits, a surprising collection of the old masters, and even some elegant rooms to view.    One year I purchased a membership, and I never tired of going.  Sometimes I would slip in and just have a peaceful time sitting in my favorite collection rooms.  As I mentioned the traveling exhibits are a wonderful addition to what you will see there.  They even had a Caravaggio exhibit shown only in the Wadsworth   Atheneum in the whole USA.  The staff is very accommodating, the price is quite reasonable, and children under twelve are free.  That makes it a relatively inexpensive day for a family.  Weather you live  nearby or just visiting, everything about this museum is filled with delights to the eye, peaceful settings and history.  There is street parking all around the block, and almost within walking distance a delightful historical carousel, park, and the capitol which you can tour for free.  In my humble opinion, it is the best part of the city.",
  "Worth a few hours to enjoy properly, this is a delightful museum. Parking is a bit difficult at times, so check for close public garages and parking lots before your trip.",
  "The Wadsworth is a great art museum.  There are some static collections that are always here, but there are also many collections that are new and very interesting.  Some are modern(Kodak) and some are very classic (like Carravaggio).  There have been displays of things like the Colt Firearms from the industrial revolution as well.  If you catch it at the right time, certain Saturdays are free!  It isn't really family friendly, but children are welcome (it might be boring for young children), but great for adults.",

  "This beautiful museum has something for everyone. I am a Renaissance Art fan so to see a huge room of it was thrilling! Art of all kinds is displayed. There are so many directions to go in. Lots of branching out. The exterior is a cool castle. Definitely worth visiting!",
  "This is a great museum with a lot of history of its own and a wonderful art collection. But, the museum also does tours, lectures, musical events, holiday events, and shows some great current movies. The restaurant at the cafe is excellent and well worth a visit. I am a museum member and truly enjoy this museum. ",
  "truly enjoyed the collection. Miro, Picasso, Monet. Plus interesting contemporary survey of African-American art.\n",
  "My husband and enjoyed strolling through the museum. We loved the John Singleton Copley portrait pair! ",
  "We spent several hours visiting the Wadsworth Atheneum for the first time and we were delighted with what we found. It seemed huge to start with, but the floor plan is easy to figure out and the galleries are easy to navigate. Many of the rooms are large and airy and wonderful for viewing the art hanging on the walls. We took a guided 1-hour tour which gave us a very good overview; then we went back and explored more on our own. They don't have a parking lot, but they will validate your parking ticket for a nearby garage -- check their website for which one -- so that your parking will only cost 3 dollars. They do not have any food, but they do have an excellent gift shop. It is impossible to see and appreciate all the art in one visit. We will be back to see more!"

  "They have done a great job at creating spaces inside and out for all ages. They have side amusements to keep everyone engaged and interested. \nClean and catered style food.\n\nI would recommend for gatherings or just a fun time out",
  "We've been to several games here with lots of family, celebrated birthdays and we all love the Yard Goats and the park.  I like that commentary about the game and players is broadcast during the game.  And so much info and happiness is displayed on the big screen. We enjoy the contests before and after the game and in between innings.  Great family fun!  The games, food and parking are affordable for families and we hope it stays that way for a long time! Making last minute plans to attend a game can be a challenge as many games are sold out before the day of the game.",
  "We have been to the Yard Goats Park with business associates and at other times with the grandkids! It's been a home run everytime! Making special arrangements is easy, the games are a blast, local awesome broadcaster Don Lovallo calls the games...The food choices are numerous and they are even a nutfree ball park.  Hartford finally has a first class city attraction!",
  "This is a fabulous place to take your family.  Don't get me wrong still love going to see Red Sox and Yankees but when you can't this is almost a more enjoyable experience.  Prices are great and there really is no bad seat in the house.",
  "We love going to the Yard Goats games with our children and Grandchildren.  The kids love the play area, taking pictures with the mascots and watching the little ones race each other.  Every year we wish our daughter a Happy Birthday on the big board, she loves it.  The only negative comment, is regarding the food.  They need to add a couple of healthy choice options!!"

  "Having heard wonderful reviews about the 7 story science museum we took our grandchildren expecting to spend the day there. Alert: there are only exhibits on 3 floors. On the plus side the exhibits are almost all interactive and the kids had a ball. On the minus side, as other reviews have mentioned, there were numerous schools groups there with VERY unattentive teachers. So to say these kids were out of control is an understatement. I ended up waiting in the lines with my grandchildren so that kids didn't continue to cut in line ahead of them. Be prepared to be exhausted after your visit so that your children have a good time. Although a little pricey, the butterfly exhibit was totally awesome and we spent over a spellbound hour in that exhibit alone.  Easy off and on access to the museum.",
  "Horrible qabsolutey horrivle. I went here with my child and some friends nefore about 4 years ago. The workers there are so rude, and unpersonal. They gave stank faces to everyone and obviously just did not want to be there. Even if you hate your job at least just put a pleasent face on. Well the experience then was al right. My daughter and her friends enjoyed the water area. I thought it was great but then last week We wnt to the Harry potter exhibit. WHICH WAS A WASTEOF MONEY. My daughter and her friend hated it. They had really only one activity, they didn't have enough material for brromsticks or wands. PLus tyou had to pay extra for an exhibit tht now looking back was the only exciting one. DO NOT RECCOMEND",
  "There are great exhibits with wonderful things to try out. One can go through this museum quickly, so if you are looking for something fun to do that will not take up a lot of time, this is the place!",
  "If you're looking for a place to take the kids that is both fun and educational, this is it. Exhibits change so call ahead!",
  "We went as a family to see the Real Bodies exhibit. That exhibit was awesome, the rest of the center, not so much. The stairwells are very confusing and the elevators are over crowded. I prefer to take stairs and I took one stairwell down and it brought me to the butterfly exhibit and then when I went out of it I was back at the elevators with no stairs around.\n\nMost of the exhibits we brought the kids to were broken or not user friendly. We were disappointed as we visit many such museums in the country but this one did not impress. We were looking especially at the energy efficient part (not up to date) and the space one which would have been cool to sit in the chairs and direct yourself through the galaxy but it was not intuitive"

  "This is one of the most beautiful state capital buildings in the country. It shows how wealthy Hartford was in the late 19th century. The dome is stunning and the interior is also attractive. The tour is worth doing and you can enter the senate and house or representative's chambers (if they are not in session). There are various statues in the capital such as the one of Nathan Hale. This is a good place to understand Connecticut history. The nearby state library (across the street) and Bushnell Park are also worth doing while in the area. Free to visit.",
  "This is easily one of the nicest State Houses in New England. To get access to both legislative chambers, take the free guided tour. We luckily found a free parking space on the north side of the capitol grounds. But there is also metered street parking close to the capitol for only $1 an hour.",
  "Amidst the blocky-looking buildings of downtown, Hartford, the Capitol juts out like a grand castle!  Its gothic-style turrets and shiny, golden dome is very reminiscent of legislative buildings in Europe.  \n\nWe visited on a Sunday, so we didn't do a tour, but relaxing on the lawn in front of this colossal structure was a great experience!",
  "The Capitol can be visited either on a self-guided tour or on a guided tour. \nWhen I first arrived, the guided tours were over for the day, so I did the self-guided one. It was not bad as you can pick up a nice booklet which gives the basic information about the building. Yet, some areas, including the Assembly Hall and the Senate Hall, are not open for those on a self-guided tour. \nSince I wanted to see them, I came back the next morning and did the guided tour. It lasted about an hour and was really interesting. The guide was very knowledgeable not only about the building but about the history of the State of Connecticut more generally. We could see the two halls and it was worth it. \nI would therefore recommend the guided tour but check the times before you go, as the last one of the day is at 1.15 or 2.15 pm.",
  "My 5 Star review is based on the fact that I love visiting state capitols. They are usually beautiful buildings open for free to the public and this one does not disappoint. \nHere are some tips to make it a good visit: Free parking is available in the lot behind the legislative office building - the new building with the green roof. (Drive past the capitol and past the entrance to 84 and then turn right between the legislative building and the Armory. Follow the road around to the back to enter the lot and park in the visitor's section on the ground floor.) Then you have to walk around, back to the front to get back to the capitol. If you have a passenger with limited mobility, I suggest you drop them off in the driveway in front of the capitol and then go and park. Facing the capitol you enter on the left side. Once inside I suggest you hook up with a tour. There are only a few given each day. If you miss the highlights tour, there are a few self guided tour brochures for the inside and outside of the building. Highlights include the Wishing Chair carved out of the Charter Oak and the old phone booth. We were lucky to hook onto a tour. It was amusing because it was a tour of Chinese tourists, who only spoke Chinese. After each sentence by the tour guide, the translator would translate for 5 minutes! What was he saying???\nAfter touring the capitol building walk across the street to see the library, the supreme court and the state museum.",

Highlights include the Wishing Chair carved out of the Charter Oak and the old phone booth. We were lucky to hook onto a tour. It was amusing because it was a tour of Chinese tourists, who only spoke Chinese. After each sentence by the tour guide, the translator would translate for 5 minutes! What was he saying???\nAfter touring the capitol building walk across the street to see the library, the supreme court and the state museum.",
  "We greatly enjoyed the tour of this building. The guides are knowledgeable and friendly, and ours even knew some ASL! She was knowledgeable and patient. The building is gorgeous. I recommend catching one of the tours (they\u2019re free!) so you can hear some of the anecdotes that are not included in the self guided pamphlet. Be aware though that the Capitol building and the Legislative Office Building are separate physical buildings but they are connected with an underground tunnel. The tour actually meets and starts inside the LOB building (which we did not realize. We parked in LOB garage, walked around the block outside to enter the Capitol, then followed signs all the way back to LOB lobby). The signs say that tours start at 15 past the hour, but they must have started a bit earlier bc we were in position at 10 past the hour and waited around until 20 past before we finally started wandering on our own and randomly joined a tour already in session. Despite the initial struggle, highly recommend seeing this building and taking the tour!!",
  "Make sure you do the guided tour, and not the self guided version. The guide was very enlightening. Learned a lot about the capital and Connecticut in general. Make sure you sit in the Charter Oak chair.",
  "Like many, I've seen the gleaming golden dome from the highway but never visited the capitol and I had some time to kill in downtown Hartford.  The security detail is welcoming and helpful but it was too late for the guided tours, however, photographs are permitted inside and, with the legislature out of session, the building was very quiet and absolutely immaculate.  There are brochures for a self-guided tour and one on the statuary which is impressive inside and out but I'll be back for the guided tours given by the Connecticut League of Women Voters, Monday-Friday at select times.\n\nWandering on your own doesn't disappoint because the architectural detail is stunning and there are artifacts on the main floor, but the experience would be enhanced with an experienced guide.  Do not miss the domed ceiling detail complete with a lighted star or the beautiful arches and take time to walk around the exterior and marvel at the detail.",
  "We visited this place on October 3. There is free parking in the streets next to the Supreme Court. After the security check we went to the Legislative Office Building to go on the guided tour. During one hour you hear some interesting stories about the building and the artifacts.\nWe had lunch at the cafeteria. The suggestion of the day was very good.",
  "I was just on the way through Hatford and went by the Capitol. I went insinde and a tour just started. The tours a free and so good. The tour guide showed us every part of the building. I really liked the Senat room, haven\n\u00b4t been to one yet. If you have a couple of ours left it is worth it going there. "

  "There really are no bad seats in this theater, all their performances masterfully arranged to be enjoyable from all angles. I\u2019ve been here many times and have been an active subscription holder for several years. If you live in or are just visiting, you really have to regularly attend the shows at Hartford Stage!",
  "Founded in the early 60's, this theater began in a former grocery store warehouse on Kinsley Street. Now located on Church Street, HS creates a home in Hartford where you can see diverse, innovative and entertaining performances.  They are also committed to community partnerships and educational programs for students of all ages.\n\nDominque Morriseau's \"Detroit '67\" offered earlier this month was a powerful drama revolving around the Detroit race riots back in the late 60's.  The superb acting, music and set design was great.",
  "Impromptu visit to Hartford to gather with family.  My Uncle asked if we\u2019d like to join them for what he thought was The Grinch.  When arriving we noted that show was actually A Christmas Carol  which I was happy about.  WOWZA!  This production was phenomenal from the first minute with the \u201cghosts\u201d to the very last scene.  Incredible acting, costumes and special effects.  I will absolutely drive to Hartford next year with our adult children to see this production again.\nI think it may be too scary for children under 6 even though there are many young children in play.  Bravo Hartford Stage.",
  "I have attended several productions with great delight ... especially the Chopin special a few years back, and recently a variety of themes and talent.  Parking is a question at times, but available in the area.",
  "With the artistic director, Darko, The Hartford Stage has been renewed!  Every show he selects will take you on an experience that will entertain, educate and bring you into the world of the characters portrayed. It does not matter if you have heard of the show previously- take the big step and trusting Darko's insight, see a show new to you, new to  your friends. If you have knowledge of the show, be ready for a new experience: feel the heat, pain, joys, challenges, contemplations, exhilirations, conflicts, and perhaps love from your seat- which is never far from the action. The price is right. I have met subscribers who travel 2 hours to reach this theater, and weather will not deter them.  The actors are cast from many, many locations. If you enjoy true theater and not just the movies, Hartford Stage is a destination deemed highly worthy! I attend with adult friends and more mature teenagers.",
  "This place rocks. Not a bad seat in the house leave some extra time to park and it can get very very sketchy at night for crimes",
  "Very nice venue- not a bad seat in the house and very intimate. Great acting and great props. They also have a bar with snacks and drinks which was a nice touch. Overall definitely recommend ",
  "My family and I are from Puerto Rico and vacationed in Waterbury for Christmas week. We planned to watch a production in Hartford Stage, A Christmas Carol. I loved it so much, it was an amazing show. The actors were great. The theater is beautiful. Employees are friendly. There is a pay parking lot. Overall it as a great experience.  Two Thumbs Up!",
  "This was my first time at the Hartford Stage  and I was totally impressed. We were there for the Pike Street show and I was totally blown away by the one woman show. Nilaja Sun was simply spectacular! She played the role of several members in her family and community and did not miss a beat. The show highlighted the family life of a Puerto Rican family during Super Storm Sandy. As you experience the show you go through a whole range of emotions-funny, sad, mad and shocked. What an exhilarating ride of emotions. As a Puerto Rican there were definitely some parts the audience did not catch which of course those who were Puerto Rican really understood. \nThe Hartford Stage did a great job! The theatre was great and more importantly the display on Puerto Rican history in the City of Hartford was very well done. Bravo Hartford Stage. We parked right next to the  theatre and was able to get a discount on parking  at the end of the night but be sure to pay for the ticket at the will call area before the show. Also if you go on the Hartford Stage website they offer great dining options to get a bite before the show which was perfect. Present your tickets and you will get a discount off you tab.",
  "Go see \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d It is worth seeing it. I saw \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d a few years ago and I just saw it last night. ",
  "I am very impressed by the Hartford Stage and their current show The Christmas Carole.  The theater is small enough that you feel like you are on the stage with the show.  The stage has all the technology to bring a dynamic experience with lights, floor openings, trapeze flying actors, snow falling, and quick scene changes.  We sat in section B second row.  My husband has a bad left knee so I chose the seat on the far left.  There was only a small opening for him to rest his leg.  I saw that the third row would have been better.  There are no big stairs to deal with and the sound is excellent even when the actors are not facing you.  The Christmas show has wonderful costumes and it moves along so you are surprised by something every few minutes.  This is a great place for families (over 8ish years old) unless they are scared by ghosts."

  "This historic building is beautiful! They have done an excellent job maintaining the facility, at the same time, the newer addition blends right in. We have enjoyed many shows over the years. We are selective when purchasing tickets as to location since the small seats and minimal amount of leg room can sometimes be too uncomfortable to enjoy the performance. The atmosphere is very comfortable, young and old and everyone in between; dressed up and casual jeans, and everything in between. Enjoy!",
  "We love the Bushnell.  The Broadway series has great shows without having to travel to NYC.  The parking is convenient and it\u2019s a quick walk to many great restaurants in downtown Hartford.",
  "The Bushnell has two major theaters and conference facilities. I have been to both theaters and have used the conference space. I would recommend all aspects of this facility. They do a wide array of shows, lectures, music and other artistic events. Their Broadway series is excellent. They have a small cafe on site and a number of bars but their refreshments can be quite expensive. I would highly recommend the Bushnell. ",
  "Love seeing shows here because it\u2019s not too far from home and there is free parking across the street. Not a bad seat in the house",
  "Fantastic show. Well worth the ticket price.\nCast, musicians and scenery were very good.\nAn old show but still as good as it was 1st time around.",

 "reviews": [
  "I really have to applaud the people at the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center for their incredible work re-vamping the traditional historic house tour into something that takes into account the extraordinarily complex legacy of Stowe's most famous work. Going in to buy tickets at the visitors' center/gift shop (which is awesomely stocked much like a social justice book shop), tour participants are advised that this will not be a typical tour and that they will be asked to participate in conversations about race in America and the history of oppression with which \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is entangled. This happens, of course, to varying degrees of success as people in tour groups get more comfortable speaking, but I think the effort to promote a different approach and not simply venerate Stowe and her work unquestioningly is significant and laudable. Yes, this might be more difficult than sitting back and listening to a guide tell you about sofas and tables, but the overall experience is completely appropriate to this writer and very rewarding. The tour begins with a conversation about how literature can bring about social change and the place of Stowe's work within this context. If you can go in with an open mind and hope that others are willing to hear your viewpoints, this experience is very rewarding!",
  "As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a museum with a slightly different \"take\" on its purpose.  Beyond the excellent presentation of the facts of Harriet Beecher Stowe's life, the tour guide invited each of us to share our comments or observations on various topics related to Stowe's life and times, mostly as it concerned slavery and the abolitionist movement.  There was no pressure to participate, but it was, at the very least, an opportunity to reflect on attitudes of that time and our present time. Certainly, if nothing else, the point was made that words can profoundly change history.  This is a museum that will make you think, if you are open to it.  Even without that aspect, the tour of the home and history of Stowe's life was worth the time and admission.  (Admission is discounted if you present your tickets from the Mark Twain House which is just next door.)  Plenty of parking in the same lot as Mark Twain House.  A flight of steps or uphill handicapped path is required to reach the entrance.  This tour is not appropriate for young children.",
  "This is a place that not only examines racism against the backdrop of the oncoming Civil War, but looks at our values as human beings and Americans in thoughtful ways. There is no real decorative art here to see. The excellent tour, facilitated by Oliver, reflects upon the life of Harriet Beecher Stowe in a very personal way and what events precipitated her writing of Uncle Tom's Cabin.",
  "We had the pleasure of visiting the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center on Sunday, March 8th.  Our tour guide was Jasmine.  She was very knowledgeable about Harriet and the things that were going on in the country.  Jasmine was very lively with a smile during her presentation.  She made you feel comfortable right from the start. A positive point in her presentation was introducing herself and having us introduce our self and tell her where we were from.  SUPER TOUR!",
  "We toured the house with several guides. They knew a lot of back ground about the family. They are revamping the house to what it was   It is better to view it in the spring so you can see the flowers.",
  "Like other reviewers mentioned, this is a tour about the pressing issues of the day by a woman who experienced personal loss and a sense of maternal empathy to the people called slaves.  It is less about architecture and material possessions yet we tour a beautiful home with a magnolia tree in its backyard.  The tour awakens the core beliefs of the tourist in a non-threatening lets have a conversation way.  HBS was not a rebel by any means but I do think that the influences of the ministry within her family resulted in her firm belief that Christians do not subjugate others in slavery although she apparently hinted her belief that the races were not equal.  While the focus of the tour was on Uncle Tom's Cabin, HBS actually authored 30 books.  It was interesting to learn that Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in a newspaper in sections which increased readership thus fanning the flame for abolitionism.  It is interesting that a woman, without any voting rights, influenced many citizens to do what was right for human rights.",
  "I was a little hesitant about this tour after reading other reviews about the intensity and controversy of their experiences.  I guess it depends on your tour guide and your particular group.  We had a smallish, pretty calm group so it was fine.  You are told at the beginning that the tour is focused more on the ideas and topics Beecher wrote about and was passionate about rather than the strictly historical facts and contents of the house.  I found it fascinating and challenging to compare this to modern times.  It would be nice if they would throw in more details about the home to bring a well-rounded view of Beecher's life.  It will definitely make you think about history's impact on current events.  I'd recommend also visiting Mark Twain's home, right across the lawn, to get the full picture of their friendship and intersecting interests.  Allow about an hour or so for the tour.",
  "this is one of the 'must see' exhibits in Hartford.  \n\nthe tour guide (Ish) made Harriet Beecher Stowe 'come alive'.  You get a unique understanding of the role Harriet Beecher Stowe, and her novel, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin' played in ending slavery in our country.  You also get a sense of the history leading up to the Civil War, from Nat Turner's rebellion to John Browns raid on the armory, to the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin to the actual Civil War..  \n\nYou can easily combine this tour with Mark Twain's house as well."

The imposing Soldiers and Sailors Arch would have been more imposing had there been less trash on the grounds below it (two big thumbs down to the litterbugs...). You can easily circumnavigate the park in 20 minutes, but take your time...",

The history here is incredible, the people you meet here visiting their loved ones are interesting too.  We got a lot of history on people who were not in the pamphlets.  We spent all day here, almost 7 hours.  It was cloudy but it made for some beautiful photos.  Spring time must be lovely when everything is in bloom.  Don't forget to check out the Church, its beautiful too.",

There are parking spaces as soon as you come through the gates but it is possible to drive through the cemetery as well. \n\nThere are several ponds on the grounds of the Cedar Hill Cemetery. They have benches around them to have a rest and take in the peaceful surroundings. \n\n",

Resting place to famous people such as: \nSamuel Colt, Inventor of the Colt Revolver, Katherine Hepburn, Actress, \nKatherine Houghton Hepburn,  president of the suffragette association in Connecticut, Isabella Beecher Hooker, social activist and sister to Harriet Beecher Stowe, John P. Morgan, Financier, Horace Wells, discoverer of anesthesia and who had a tragic death......and many more.  Always a slow and pondering moment to these ones who made some impact in our history.",

  "The XL Center is decent, but getting old. The viewing is average for a multi-use facility. The food offering is limited and not particularly special. The staff was friendly & very helpful !!!..The facility is easy to get to off of the Interstates; but parking is limited. There are several, varied type restaurants within walking distance.",
  "I have been to XL Center twice to see the Hartford Wolf Pack and enjoyed both games. Even though this is an older facility, it does have its advantages. Fans who arrive early can wait in the lobby, unlike other arenas I've been to (Webster Bank Arena, Mohegan Sun Arena) where early arrivers have to wait outside. Also, there is a nice variety of food available; be sure to try the barbecue from the Bear Smoke House stand! The last time I went, it was Calendar Night, with calendars for the first 2,500 fans; it was also Star Wars Night. When you purchase tickets, avoid the rows close to the ice unless you want to look through the glass, which can make viewing the game difficult.",
  "You may not agree with my review title if you're driving in 15 minutes before an event or trying to leave right after an event. Hartford is a city and just like any other city's event center you should expect some traffic. The XL Center is excellent if you're willing to enjoy yourself and stop by a local restaurant or bar before and/or after your event. The XL Center is again but still meets the needs of most event, it's especially nice that there are multiple exits all around the perimeter of the venue; you don't have to wait in a heard to get outside. (I went to a similair venue inanother city that only has 1 exit, it took 20 minutes to get outside from our seats!)",
  "We were here for the final Uconn girls basketball game. Seats were nice. I think they should have had more seat attendants. We found our seats ourselves. Smells like fried food when walking halls. Otherwise seats were good and it is nice to have a venue place with not too long of a drive.",
  "We attended an event here last night. It is difficult to give an appraisal of the concourse as there were less that a thousand in attendance, however, when full I would expect the concourse to be tightly packed. So, not enough room. Restroom facilities, though appearing to be bright and recently redone are lacking in stall space. You basically need to stradle the seat in order to close the door. Our seat location was in an area that had removable seats such that when someone was coming down the stairs all the seats shook. We didn't partake in any of the concessions though they appeared to be reasonably stocked and varied.",
  "Season Tickets to Uconn Basketball. Good restaurants nearby -walking distance-Park at Hilton and walk across bridge to main Entry",
  "I can\u2019t believe they still hold events here. Outside steps are falling apart. Narrow concourses are super crowded and offer bad food. Terrible seating bowl. Uncomfortable seats. They should\u2019ve knocked it down after the roof collapsed or when the Whalers moved to Carolina. It looks like it was built over 40 years ago...which it was. ",
  "My individual and I received tickets through AARP for a WOLFPACK GAME. My guy has a Walker so the original seats he just can't do.  We were directed to GUEST SERVICES. The woman I dealt with was so kind and understanding to my situation. She got us incredible seats and other support staff was so accommodating to all our needs. I thanked all involved and just want to put it our there.  \"Thank you all for a Wonderful experience from both of us\"!"

  "Housed in a decorative pavilion on the edge of Bushnell Park, this historic carousel provides a bit of old-fashioned fun.  Built in 1914 and beautifully maintained, the carousel features 48 colorful horses hand carved by the legendary Solomon Stein and Harry Goldstein.  For the minimal ticket price of just $2, children and kids at heart can take a ride back in history accompanied by the cheerful tones of traditional Wurlitzer organ music.  Snacks and souvenirs are also available.",
  "A beautiful piece of American history and although for children we found it so beautiful to stop and look at \nThe restoration is just beautiful and it was lovely to see them children riding it and hearing the music playing so glad we found it in the park ",
  "We have visited nearly 120 pre-1930 hand-carved, wooden carousels, and this one is near the top. It is a Stein and Goldstein carved carousel and only one of 3 S and S carousels still in existence. Beautifully restored and maintained. Rides are $2. Great popcorn ($1)!!",

Hearing the music and watching the colorful horses circle around was a delight. I visited the carousel with friends and their two young children, and we all had a blast. The kids enjoyed picking out their horses, and the adults enjoyed the entertaining music. It was the first time any of us heard Johnny Cash as a carnival-type tune on an organ. The song was stuck in my head for days afterward, but I didn't mind. A ride on the carousel is an affordable and fun way to spend an hour or so on a weekend afternoon. At the ticket booth, you can also learn more about the carousel's history and buy little souveneirs. There was a children's birthday party taking place while we were there. It seemed like a great place for a kids' party, and everyone was having fun."

  "This massive spiritual giant gives shining star to the state Capital and the Heart of the Christian family of Connecticut. Although simple in design, there is a certain majestic feeling as you alow the sun to filter througe the strong colors above. The musice is exceptionally beautiful on Sunday Masses.  Parking is located in the back entrance or next to the Bishop Office. ",
  "We we're able to walk through this beautiful Church. The windows are just amazing. We loved the sculptures as well. This is a great stop, to add to your site scene. You do not need to a lot too much time yet you'll be glad you stopped.",
  "This is a must see modern cathedral. Go in the day time, the stained glass windows are evocative of St. Chapelle in Paris - breathtaking!",
  "So peaceful to see and enjoy the beautiful church and music. Just Huge and easy walking area.  Don't forget see the second floor.  The Craftsmen so breath taking.  I gone many time and love going to see this beauty .  There is parking in the back of the Cathedral. .",
  "Try to get here during the day.  The windows are absolutely wonderful!  It's so peaceful and restorative.  Not a bad place for music, though the seating is uncomfortable after a while.",
  "Stopped by after visiting the Twain Museum and was glad we did; was just gorgeous. Worth it to go see.",
  "What a beaut!!! Went to Mass while visiting. HUGE!  Sparsely attended for the 8:30 Mass. So sparse, I was asked to help with the collection, which was an absolute honor.  This is a marvel to see and worship.",
  "A very beautiful Catholic church.  Modern in design but quite beautiful.  If you are looking for an \"old and ornate\" cathedral, this is not the one for you."

  "It's kind of a small park setting.  It doesn't take very long to go through the whole thing and IMO most of the headstones and such had been redone/replaced with replicas. It was nice and shady and there are benches to rest.  The area is a little shady in another way - be prepared for panhandlers.",
  "We were travelers retracing our family ancestry to the Ancient Burying Ground - monument.  So glad we visited on a Sunday when traffic downtown was very light.  We found 10 names engraved on the monument connecting directly with our ancestry family trees.",
  "This is a small cemetery but interesting as well. Considering some of the stones were from the 1800\u2019s they are still in fairly good shape and you can still read them. The pamphlet at the side gate is helpful on some of the the sites. There are also flags/markers to help in location of the graves in the pamphlet.",
  "This burying ground is filled with atmosphere. There is a sign that tells you interesting graves to visit for various reasons such as the gravestone carvings or perhaps the person was important. There are many graves here that are 200-300 years old. This is my second visit here. It is a short walk from the state capital building and the old state house.",
  "They offer wonderful programs that give you information on the early days of Hartford and Connecticut."

  "Went to see the Zac Brown concert July 6th and had a fantastic time. According to the news there were 25,000people there! We have gone to numerous concerts there fro many years. The positives: you can either seat on the lawn for less cost or under cover for more. We love the lawn so we can sit or dance.you can bring your own chairs 9 in or less for height or rent chairs but do it when you order tickets as they go fast. We are aging so the the lawn seats are getting more difficult. The lawn is on a hill and is large with beverage and food booths at the top.bottom and sides. There is a spot designated for people who have disabilities which has a hard surface with a fence around it.There is also a fenced in area on the grass if you want to coral yourself and kids. This venue can fit a lot of people and as the night goes  on it can fill to capacity. There are many screens so you can see the stage and we have always felt the  sound and picture is very good. There are many bathrooms and food and beverage spots. Pay attention to them as you enter so when it gets crowed you will knw where to go.\n   The negatives There is free parking if you go early near the venue. It not the cost of paid parking can be 30 dollars and up. Many are near and some much further 2-4 blocks. The streets can get so blocked that you may be late for your show,unless you plan to come early.It all depends on who is playing. You should be ok as long as you try to get there 30-60 min before the show. Many people tail gate and you can do that in most parking lots and there are many! Beer and wine cost 12-14 dollars for large cans and bottles. Food is all prices  ranging from 10.00 and up. If you have never gone you must go through a check site if you are carrying bags or napsacks. You will be patted down. Sometimes you can get in with hidden beer and wine?Will you dare? Luck of the draw! Check the site for what is allowed ,water is one that is allowed. The staff is very friendly unless someone is a jerk.Everyone is in a good mood usually and excited all ages. Have fun and enjoy the outdoors and the music. Summer is short! Stay safe! If you need assistance ask and they wlll help you. Cant wait to be back.....Peace!\n",

  "Xfinity is the concert area to go to during the summer. They have many seats including some that are covered by a Pavillion and then they also have a lawn area. Quite expensive for drinks and food so just know that going in. I paid 15 dollars for a large bottle of water. If you park towards hartford there is a free parking area. Just difficult to get out of quickly.  Overall if your favorite band or singer is going it worth it. I prefer the seats closer to the stage but the lawn does have monitors.",
  "Good thing Zac Brown rocked it. We were at the first show ever at the meadows and the place has not been updated since. How do you not have monitors on the side walls for all seats to see? Then the quality of monitors that can be seen is awful. \nThe prices charged is absolutely ridiculous and the exact reason why you should tailgate then go into the show. \nThe service fees that are charged is a joke as well. We always look at other venues first before settling on going back. Can not wait for Bridgeport Amphitheater to open ",
  "Ridiculously high beer prices and lots of drunken people, including what appeared to be underage. Why do they allow so many people to get so blasted?",
  "I\u2019ve been to more concerts here than I can count, since way back when this venue was called \u201cthe Meadows.\u201d Most of the time, it\u2019s been great, but recently I\u2019ve been to several concerts where they clearly sold more tickets than there were spaces for people. This really detracts from the experience and feels borderline unsafe. Hootie and the Blowfish this past weekend was one such instance. Line to get in was so long we missed part of the first act, and once we were on the lawn we could barely move. Please just cap the number of tickets you sell at a reasonable number; I\u2019d rather not go at all than be packed like a sardine and barely able to hear the band.",
  "Parking.....well organized and went in the free lat, the walk to the venue was not far.\nEntry and staff.....no problem with the line getting in it moved right along.  There was a snafu with the reserved lawn chair, had to wait for more to arrive but the staff was pleasant.\nlawn.....had no problem on the lawn.  Heavy metal fans know how to respect each other as we all rock out together.\nMaiden......they are ALWAYS great!  No technical problems or delays.\nExiting the lot.......this is never fun, patience is a virtue.",
  "Saw Dierks Bentley here and other than the ridiculously overpriced beers, it was an amazing show! We enjoyed waiting outside watching the big screen while we finished our drinks. I bought these tickets when Ticket master had concert week in May. Got them for $20 each!!"

  "Great place to see a show. Staff is friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. Bar in the back can get backed up, but there is a huge bar on the street level and you can bring your drinks back to your seat. Sound is awesome. While the seats are the \u201cfold up\u201d type (for configuration flexibility), they are padded and very comfortable with cup holders. Park in one of the garage lots next to the venue for $5. Easy access from I-91 and I-84 in a cool section of downtown Hartford. ",
  "Infinity in Hartford holds about 500 people.  While some seats are, of course, better than others, there isn't a bad seat in the place.  The acoustics are just perfect.  I've seen more than one performer who remarked upon what a great hall it is.  I have nothing but fond memories of attending shows by Richard Thompson, Bettye LaVette, Nick Lowe, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Hot Tuna, and Rhiannon Giddens.  The staff is friendly in an enthusiastic way--they really seem invested in seeing to you having a great time.  Ushers, bartenders, everyone.  Get this:  there's a parking garage right across the street where you pay $5 for the night.  In Hartford, that's a minor miracle. There are several good restaurants right on the same block.  I can't say enough about this jewel of a venue.  Oh, and it's a couple blocks from the entrances to the major highways.  A quick ride in, a quick ride out.  By far my favorite place to see a show.",
  "I'm not sure if I should consider a 500 seat venue as being intimate. But it sure does feel that way. There wasn't a bad seat in the house.\nWe went to Infinity Music Hall to see Beau Bolero. A Steele Dan cover band. The band was excellent.\nWe sat way up in the mezzanine section at table FF. Even at that distance, we still had a great view of the band. In our section we were right in front of the bar and bathrooms.\nWe were able to take a quick walk to get a drink or roam over to the other two tables to talk with friends that we went with for the concert.\nIt was an intimate comfortable atmosphere.\nThe main level has a huge bar room off to the left side.\nThe seating is great, the acoustics are great, and the venue is within walking distance of a few restaurants. Such as, The Capital Grille, \nTed's Montana Grill, Bear's Smokehouse Barbeque, El Pollo Guapo, Front Street Bistro, and the Blind Pig Pizza Company.\nIt's also not a far drive from many other places to eat in Hartford.\nI can't wait to go back and have a nice dinner and enjoy another great concert at Infinity Music Hall.",
  "Since ownership changed some time ago the bistro is gone in Hartford. While we didn't eat there we enjoyed the table service for drinks in the mezzanine where we prefer to sit. Staff was excellent and very attentive. All manner of drinks were served in a glass as well. Now it's plastic cups across the board. Kinda cheesy. Might sound silly to some but it's a real turn off for my wife and I. That said it's still my favorite place to see an act.\nSound has always been spot on and there's really not a bad seat in the house. Parking is cheap and plenty of places to eat nearby. Last saw The Feelies here in Nov. 2019. Outstanding show!",
  "This has gone through some changes since the change of ownership.  The bistro is gone, so the name should be changed on here.\nBut the acoustics are still excellent.  I recommend getting a seat that it not under the balcony, which means row I or closer.  But not too close, or your neck will get stiff unless from looking up.\nThey are taking the seats out for a lot of shows, now, so we took seats upstairs for the North Mississippi All Stars.  The show was amazing, non-stop music for three hours.  But the sound is better downstairs.\nI did find that, even though the show was \"ballroom\" style with most of the seats pulled out, there were seats off to one side, so people who wanted to sit downstairs could do so."

  "TheaterWorks has great plays and actors.  The small stage is an intimate setting.  An the sets are always professionally constructed.  The theater has been newly renovated and should be an even better venue for the creative arts.  And the staff are always helpful.",

  "My wife and I have been subscribers to TheaterWorks for several years and have enjoyed most, if not all the productions.  It is a very small theater in the basement of an office building on Pearl Street in Hartford.  If you are claustrophobic this place my give you some concern.  It is the opposite of Goodspeed but with the same issue.  The exits are limited and small.\nIf you can get beyond that, this is excellent theater at a very reasonable cost.  The productions are imaginative and varied.  The current production \"The Legend of Georgia McBride\" is very energetic and lots of fun.  They now offer reserved seating although you need to reserve seats for each play; you are not assigned a seat for the season.  This is a major improvement.  They have also received funding for some major renovations which will be welcome.\nThis is excellent theater and consistent theater.  I highly recommend this theater.",
  "Productions range from new plays to revivals of  standards.  I have subscribed for five years and have enjoyed the majority of the plays.  Although seats are not assigned (unless you pay an extra fee) virtually every seat  allows you to see and hear everything on stage.  In summary, a totally enjoyable  theater experience.",
  "After reading some reviews of \"Freud's Last Session\" by Mark St. Germain at the theaterworks, we decided to go on a Saturday afternoon.  We were glad we did.  The play depicts an imaginary meeting between Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis late in the life of Freud after he had fled Vienna and settled in London in 1939.  The meeting takes place in Freud's masterfully recreated office with the then present dangers of WW II overshadowing the meeting.  Lewis, an atheist in his early years, was converted to Christianity through the influence of Tolkien and others and became a foremost author and champion of the Christian faith.  Freud, the conceiver of psychoanalysis, was an avowed atheist.  In the play these two giants in their field debate the issues,Is there a God? Is there an afterlife?  The younger Lewis is played by Jonathan Crombie and the older Freud in played by Kenneth Tigar.  Both men were excellent in their roles.  This 90 minute one act play is well worth your time and money.  Go!",

  "I have been in many convention center's throughout the country in the last 12 years and must say that Hartford's Convention Center ranks among the best.  It is beautifully designed with an airy feel, roomy, and conveniently located by the Marriott hotel and CT Science Center and downtown.  Parking is convenient and the free DASH transport is superb.  Handicap accessible as well. ",
  "Whether for the flower and garden show or the Home show, this venue provides a great setting for vendors to display their products, goods and services.  Just went to the Home show and it had a wide array of industries represented.  Parking is a bit pricey in the garage, but the most convenient thing to do.  Good selection of restaurants right across the street for post show meals.  They usually do have cafe food in the convention center also.  Many business, especially banks and other sponsors provide free passes into the show, so look around.  Webster Bank provided ours.",
  "My first trip there was for the CT Flower Show as a volunteer.  I was only on the second floor and it was well maintained.  Restrooms are easy to find if you just look up as large signs on walls are above eye level.  I did not eat there but there seemed to be plenty of room to purchase food and sit down at lunch.  I contacted facility to see if food could be brought in and was told that I could not, although no one was checking to see what was in my jacket.  I parked in the Front Street Garage across the street before show opened on a weekday and had no problem, but others that volunteered other shifts had found garages full. Some ended up in the Science Center garage even on a Saturday.  Easy access back to 91 or 84W.",
  "Been to the Home Show and RV/Camping show here.  Actual convention center is very nice, many large bathrooms, nice views of the Connecticut river.  Parking garage is right off the highway and super convenient.   However, I have never been in a parking garage that is so difficult to navigate.  It is hard to find your way to the convention center, and even harder to find the exit when trying to leave the garage.  Parking is also a bit pricey.

  "This year, today, was the first time I attended The Connecticut Flower Show. I thought a perfect outing for a rainy February Sunday\u2014 flowers in perfusion that would certainly brighten the day. Now, I was not expecting The Rose Bowl or even a diorama scene by a Hollywood set designer re-creating a scene from Please Don\u2019t Eat The Daisies. Apparently this year had a Parisian theme\u2014 perhaps several French flower market carts overflowing with FLOWERS? Nope\u2014 they had a couple of displays intending to be a nod to Paris\u2014 a pretty pink bicycle with a few small baskets of flowers thrown in. Something you would expect to see in any grocery store heralding Spring has sprung. Nothing to write home about. As I walked through the dozens & dozens of vendors, many selling items having nothing to do with flowers or horticulture whatsoever, I wondered if anyone from this event had ever travelled to Holland. Because if they ever had, they would have seen what flowers in profusion would look like. This event was so dismal that it should either be drastically, and I mean DRASTICALLY improved in the future, or discontinued entirely. Because as a native Connecticut resident I felt completely and thoroughly ashamed of this sorry attempt at a FLOWER SHOW."

  "We have visited the Connecticut Historical Society (CHS) Museum in Hartford, Connecticut multiple times, most recently on Saturday, December 28, 2019 and have always enjoyed it. Both the permanent and special exhibits in this museum have consistently been nice representations of Connecticut\u2019s history. This time we particularly liked the special exhibits.\n\nAlthough we only were able to spend about an hour and a half at the museum this time, we estimate that it would take at least three hours to see this museum and appreciate all that it has to offer. Admission into this museum is free on the first Saturday of the month but museum passes may be available at your local library for free admission on other days.\n\nSpecial Exhibits:\n\n\u2018War/Maps Mystery: Dutch Mapmaker Bernard Romans and the American Revolution\u2019.  \n\nThis exhibit is relatively small, being in one gallery, but gives a very interesting story about Bernard Romans, a surveyor, cartographer, engineer and naturalist, whose maps contributed significantly to European exploration and Colonial settlement.  It reveals much about life in America, the printing business, slave ownership and the upheaval of revolution.  His life has many different facets, being a Dutchman who explores North America, who works for the British in the French and Indian War.  British officers use his maps while fighting in the American Revolution but he joins the Patriots and is captured by the British and disappears at sea while being a prisoner of war.\n\nMultiple topics are very nicely illustrated including his Dutch exploration, surveying for the British, mapping the Floridas, maps for the Revolution, his service in the Continental Army and proposing an attack on Fort Ticonderoga as well as information on Connecticut and the new United States. This exhibit was definitely quite interesting and worth seeing. The maps in this exhibit are of historical significance and are nicely preserved.   \n\n \u2018Pieces of American History \u2013 Connecticut Quilts\u2019:\n\nThis exhibit was well laid out and nicely presented how quilts reveal pieces of history, changes in the global and local economy, education and politics and the bonds of family, community and memory.  Beautifully well preserved quilts, textiles, and articles of clothing with nicely documented detailed write-ups descripting them are on display in multiple galleries and provide a nice representation of quilts and textiles in general. The exhibit showed the practical household need that quilts fulfill but also how they express personal artistry, emotion and belief, representing many aspects of American home life.  \n\nThe question: \u2018What is a quilt? Is addressed and several different topics are nicely presented depicting the history of quilts over different timeframes. These topics include quilts in the New Republic (1790 \u2013 1825) showing the connections between family histories; the impact of the Industrial Revolution (1780 -1860) and the Cotton Gin (1794) on quilt making; and \u2018Romanticism and Quilts\u2019 (1825 \u2013 1860), embracing imagination, emotion, nature, religion and an idealized vision of history with details on historic revivalism, fancy and sentimentality with respect to quilts. Also, the period of the Civil War (1861 \u2013 1865), which showed how women expressed patriotism in the quilts that they made; and the quilts with respect to Post-Civil War Industrialization (1865 \u2013 1900) and the Gilded Age, the Centennial (1876) and the 20th Century (1900s) were illustrated. This was an excellent exhibit, definitely educational and worth seeing. There were some very beautiful well preserved quilts and articles of clothing on display. The exhibit reveals many different interesting aspects of the history of quilts and we highly recommend it.\n\nPermanent Exhibits:\n\nThe permanent exhibit, \u2018Making Connecticut\u2019, took a broad look at Connecticut\u2019s history including its people, their lives and work, and changes in the world around them. It gave a comprehensive history of Connecticut starting from the native Quinnetukut settlers, whom Connecticut was named after, through to the present time. The \u2018Making Connecticut\u2019 Exhibit was broken down into multiple sections based on time period which included several smaller exhibits with many objects and other artifacts on display with very informative supporting write-ups, interactives and videos explaining them. The time periods included Colonial Life (1687 \u2013 1774), the American Revolution (1775 \u2013 1783), the Civil War, WWI and WWII and the building of modern life (1945 to today). The exhibits included items made in Connecticut and details about the factors impacting technological advances in Connecticut within each time period.\n\nThe permanent collection of American Inn and Tavern Signs was also very interesting and unique. The outside grounds of the museum were well maintained, beautifully landscaped and nice for picnicking when the weather gets warmer. There was also plenty of free parking on the museum\u2019s grounds.\n\nThis museum was worth visiting for a very comprehensive history of Connecticut. There was a lot to see in this museum and it may take more than one visit to absorb and appreciate all it has to offer, including enjoying the changing special exhibits and changes in the permanent exhibits.",
  "Having read about their current special exhibit, Black Citizenship in the Age of Jim Crow, I serendipitously made my way to the museum on the first Saturday of the month when it is free to visit (I still gave a donation). \nThe exhibit was rather extensive, including information I'd already known but also introducing nuances of the Black experience that aren't often explored. \nI didn't have as much time to explore the rest of the building, though I did take a quick walk through the permanent exhibit, Making Connecticut.\nI find it worth a second visit, for sure.",
  "The Connecticut Historical Society has a great archive for those needing to do research.  Both manuscripts and books are available for use.  They have several temporary exhibits throughout the year and often have an exhibit prepared by CCSU Public History students.",

Admission into this museum was free because it was the first Saturday of the month but museum passes may be available at your local library for free admission on other days.\n\nSpecial Exhibits:\n\nThe current special exhibit, \u2018Patios, Pools and the Invention of the American Backyard\u2019 was quite interesting, unique and nicely done. It was a great escape to see an exhibit on the backyard on a rainy day in the middle of winter!!  The exhibit was quite comprehensive and went into detail about many different aspects of the backyard, which grew in the 1950s post World War II era due to multiple factors including growth of the middle class, a rise in home ownership, increase in leisure time and movement to the suburbs.\n\nSome of the topics in the exhibit included:  the Anatomy of the Backyard; the Rise of the Patio: the Do-it-Yourself Approach; Backyard foods and the grill; Garden Styles, including Formal, Practical and Cottage; Going from Tanks to Track Homes, including inventing mass produced suburbs like Levittown; Segregation and Village Creek; a whole section to design your own backyard; Postwar Garden Designs, the Bride\u2019s First Garden, including the use of a five year Installment plan; the role of home magazines in landscape designs; Model homes and the use of modern materials; the American Lawn and its maintenance; Flowers for the Space Age with peacetime uses for atomic energy based on advances in chemistry and radiation that aided the seed companies; Chemicals and the Environment with pesticides and herbicides being peacetime adaptations of chemicals and their later impact; and Backyard Play. \n\nWe thought that this exhibit was very educational, being a good lesson in history and science and definitely worth seeing.  All the write-ups included within the exhibit were quite informative and provided great details.\n\nThe special exhibit on \u2018Hamilton: His World, His Words, His Hair\u2019 was a small exhibit that provided historical information about Alexander Hamilton, including his role serving under George Washington, helping to write the Constitution, serving as the first US Treasury Secretary and being shot and killed on July 11, 1804 in a dual with Aaron Burr.  However, the exhibit was more about the Broadway musical and its characters as opposed to historical details about Hamilton\u2019s life. Regardless of this, the exhibit was quite unique and interesting.    \n. \nPermanent Exhibits:\n\nThe permanent exhibit, \u2018Making Connecticut\u2019, took a broad look at Connecticut\u2019s history including its people, their lives and work, and changes in the world around them.

The exhibit was quite interesting and nicely done, being a very good walk back through history. It gave many personal stories associated with Connecticut residents during the war which were quite informative It included well preserved uniforms, weaponry, and other war memorabilia, all nicely on display.\n\nThe special exhibit was also quite comprehensive and went into detail about many different important topics associated with the war in multiple galleries. These topics included: Europe During WWI; Highlighted Battles; The Influenza Epidemic, which occurred during the war;  How Connecticut Responded to the War, including the Military Census, the Draft, War Factory Production and Rallying the Public; The Use of Bonds and Liberty Loans;  Enlistment, Training and Deployment; Details about both the Army and Navy during the war; Details about the \u201c26th\u201d Yankee Division; Impressions of the Days on the Front; Chemical Warfare, Machine Guns and the Trenches; Keeping up Morale; Taking a Break in a YMCA Hut, including a recreation of an actual hut; Listen: Letters Home; Hospitals, Nurses and the Red Cross Efforts; the Cost of the War: 1914 \u2013 1919; the War Ends and Life Goes On;  Post-War Relief Efforts; Women Fight for Equal Rights; the Espionage Act of 1917; Rights for Workers; The American Legion; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Shell Shock as well as much, much, more.

  "This building is very historic and the guided tour will give you all the key details of the history and Connecticut's govt. of that time period. The third floor of the building has a museum of curiosities with various animals and shells including a 2 headed calf, an alligator, and a narwhal tusk. The museum in the basement has various Hartford products and tells you about the history of the city. The cost to visit is $6 and it is money well spent. Plan for 2-3 hours here if you like to read the displays. I have been here twice and would come again.",
  "From the current Statehouse we walked through the adjacent park to the Old State House. It's a beautiful old building that houses a diverse and interesting museum collection. ",
  "Spent a recent winter morning with some friends touring The Old State House!!! What a fantastic way to spend some time - our guide Brian was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The guided tour is free with your admission - which I might add is very very reasonable ($3.00 with a AAA membership) plus, they validate your parking ticket so it only cost $5.00 to park!!! I am a life long Connecticut resident and hadn't been in years - so happy we all went again. What a beautiful historic place . A great place for the whole family!!! Highly recommend it - there are plenty of places nearby to grab some lunch",
  "AAA discount was $3.  They were proactive at the desk about asking me if I was military, a teacher, a student or AAA, which was nice.  I knew walking in the door that I got a discount by showing my AAA card (be prepared to present it!), but I thought it was a refreshing change of pace for them to actually offer me a way to pay less than the full admission price.\nThe tour starts with a 5 minute video overview of Hartford history, during which you sit on comfy couches while watching the video on a giant flat panel tv recessed in an old fireplace.  \nAfterward, you can either take a self-guided audio tour or a guided tour (which I took).  My tour guide was Hannah (who I thought was excellent and very knowledgeable).  \nIf you have kids in tow, highlights (of the guided tour) will be the giant LEGO Old State Building (in the lobby) and the Museum of Oddities (3rd floor) with the two-headed calf.  However, young kids might be bored with most of the guided tour.  Stick with the kids areas on the lower level and try the \u201cbuild Hartford\u201d block area, where there are bins of location-coded colored blocks and a grid map on the floor for kids to build Hartford during certain historical periods.  Neat concept.\n\nAllow 30 mins for the video and guided tour.  Allow 15 mins for the walk-through display area on the lower level.  Add more time if you have kids who want to explore the kids area, or if you wander back through for more pictures.\n\nConveniently located a couple blocks from the Convention Center, the Science Center and several hotels.",
  "Admission is gained through a ticket office on the lower level. Guided tours cost the same as unguided.  We were glad that we chose the guided version and appreciated the insights that our guide, Ron, provided. The building itself has been through many changes over the years, but has been restored to its original state. \nDon't miss the great museum on the lowest level, \"thirty feet under the bricks\". Its great for all ages, but especially geared toward kids. ",

  "The building is beautiful and historical but once you get inside the propaganda begins.  Although, related women and African Americans  is part of the history of Connecticut, it was overwhelming.  It is interesting to note very little discussed on the history of the nations creation.  If you want the complete history, avoid this museum.  It\u2019s sad that small group of \u201ceducators \u201c pick and choose based on their prejudices in what is shown in this museum. ",
  "Very interactive.  Great Colonial history and the curiosities museum is a fun surprise.  Unfortunately,  the gift shop is no longer in operation."

  "We went to see the film about Maria Callas and everything about the experience was grand.  The theater itself is very comfortable with wide roomy seats and a very good amount of legroom between rows.  There isn't a bad seat in the house.  Very friendly staff and a concession stand with beverages, food, candy and pop corn was a nice touch.  Three art shows were going on too and it was nice to see local contemporary art.  All in all, a very nice evening out.  On the Monday we attended the show, the theater was not crowded at all.  Strongly recommend this venue.",
  "A year or so ago, Real Art Ways (RAW) hired a new cinema coordinator, Ian Ally-Seals. Since then the quality and variety of films shown has noticeably improved, so we are going here more often (about 1/2 hour drive). Films shown are generally \"Indie\" and cover all genres. Ian occasionally also offers film courses, which are fabulous. Films selected are always interesting and Ian is always superbly well prepared. The building is low-rent funky. Rotating paintings and sculpture are also on exhibit.",
  "My husband and I were impressed with all that RAW has to offer, and charmed by the small scale and neighborhood feel of the place when we came to see Loving Vincent. Lots of people came early to enjoy the cafe and several art exhibits before the movie. Do choose your seat carefully, as there is not a lot of slope to the theatre floor and your view could be blocked by someone taller sitting in front of you. Clean bathrooms, plenty of free parking.

  "Trinity College is an old Gothic architecture built in the late 1800s. The highlight for me was the Chapel. We arrived at a time when the choir was rehearsing for a service - beautiful! The Rose window was jewel-toned sunshine, the pews had a fascinating array of individual carvings on each of the the finials, all done by one man. After our visit at the chapel, we were treated to a NTLIve transmission of a theatre broadcast in London. A delightful Sunday!!",
  "anyone who are caucasian should not put their child in this school as long as they have an instructor there that teaches ALL whites should be dead!!

  "A popular place to visit in Dublin that doesn\u2019t take too much time if you only visit the college. The tours they offer take about 35 minutes are are relatively cheap. ",
  "Great school if you can afford it but look out the school is surrounded by the ghetto. Students have been beat up on a regular basis walking back from a bar. Gangs have entered campus and beat the ship out of students.",

Restaurants have tried and failed, shops the same.  \n\nOther than a few annual events this is a sadly underultilzed area of Hartford that could be such a great use of space. \n\nIts worth a walk, and most likely will leave you asking the same question as I...why isn't there more here?",

  "We were walking towards the Science Centre and the river when we decided to walk along the river bank. There was a number of interesting sculptures along the river bank and the general views were great. At the end of the path was the boathouse, jetty and Riverside Park. There was lots of green space for picnics, dog-walking or just chilling out. We also spotted a walkway over the main road which got us back to the Radisson Hotel in about 10 minutes. ",
  "What a Great Find a number of barbecue areas for large and small groups. An area for the. Children to play. An rock climbing wall with volley ball area and trails from challenging to beginner. \nIf you have a pole you can throw a line into the water; toss a frisbee or football or just recline and chill. \nAgain, this is a great",
  "Love it here.  So peaceful and yet so close to the city.  Great expansive lawns for picnics and the river is totally accessible to a canoe or small boat.  "

  "My husband and I stopped in here the other day on our way to dinner in downtown Hartford.  The location is pretty close to the highway and easily found. There are a handful of parking spaces right in front of the brewery entrance.  The place is large inside with lots of space at the bar and a handful of long tables for people to sit at as well.  They could definitely fit a few more tables in there if they wanted to (especially because by 5:30 the place was already pretty packed).  They also have a bar top that runs along the outside wall for additional places to stand and put your drink on.  On the tables they had a bowl filled with peanuts for snacking.  They offer flights for around $10 with large pours of what they have on tap.  They also sell pints and allow you to bring your own food in as well.  The place is decorated with a lot of reclaimed wood and looks like they took time to design the place.  Make sure to check out their website for rules on growler fills.  They will fill any clean growler, but you have to buy a $1 sticker to put over the other brewery's label.  They also sell growlers for $3.",

  "The Hanging Hills Brewing Company is another new craft brewery located in the Hartford area.  The facility has a lots of a seats for thirsty beer lovers.  The beers are decent so stop by and give them a try.  Support your local brewers!",
  "Absolutely disgusting, people that work there act like children. Our waiter almost threw something at us because he didn't like how or what we ordered. Almost like we were in some dictatorship lol\n Stay away from this psycho place. The management didn't really seem to care that one of their employees acted like he could be extremely violent. Spend your money at some place safe. Absolutely disgusting",
  "Enjoyed my first visit and will be back for more if in area. Good variety of styles and flavors and plenty of options to go. Cool vibe and fun hang!",
  "Went with friends.  The service was very poor.   Beer is fair but we had a very hard time getting past the poor service this the poor review.",
  "Visited Hanging Hills for the first time this weekend and was extremely impressed.  They have all varieties of beer and you honestly can\u2019t go wrong with any of them.  Their ipas were great but I was lucky enough to try their pie curious sour ipa which was phenomenal.  Everyone who works there was super friendly and the live music was great.  This brewery is definitely a rising star!  ",
  "This brewery is so much fun. We have been three times to Sunday music. People bring thei own snacks and drink beer. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxing. Pick up a bag of chips and other snacks and get ready to let go of pressure. Try to go when there is music. Remember to tip the bar team."

  "A great library with loads of quiet space and areas to chill with a vast array of services and learning resources. It would be awesome if you could get free parking with a library card but all in all well worth a visit!",
  "Lots of great magazines to read in the library or through an app. I really love the fact they have a variety of DVDs to rent. Can reserve stuff online too.",
  "I spend some nice quiet moments reading. Such a great collection. Residents have access to movies, music and even things they can take home. \n\nI was doing some research and the librarians were so great helping me use the computers and find books. \n\nDon't take your libraries for granted!  Take your kids and go find yourself a good book or movie, too! ",
  "This is a rarity: the main street HPL has a YouMedia center, a space designed specifically for teens. They can try out 3D printing, use the sound studio, record videos, and learn about social research. The book selection is fantastic, staff are knowledgeable, and The Kitchen is a fav, both for the food and the social effort it embodies.  ",
  "As soon as we walked into this library, we could see that it is a very busy place. There were people of all ages here. This library features many wonderful services for its citizens including a job and career center. The American Place gives immigrants and refugees help in adjusting to life in the United States. The people who work here are very friendly and helpful."

  "We had a couple of the pilsners and a Irish red. All tasty. Minimalist setting. Check their calendar and go when there\u2019s a food truck. Mercado\u2019s was there for our visit and had great food.",
  "I'd been wanting to come here for a while but only had an opportunity to go for the first time this past weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My husband and I went for a social event and, on the advice of the knowledgeable baristas, both liked our different drinks (I got a hard cider and my husband got a light beer, both on tap).  The brewery is set in an industrial building, as many breweries seem to be these days.  The entrance can be a bit hard to find if you don't know where to look, as it's down a small alley, but it's clean and non-sketchy.  There's a good games selection if you want to chill, and the food truck looked like it had good options.",
  "We went here a few weeks back on the spur of the moment.  Hog River is located in an old industrial building and it is tricky to find at first so hang in there.  Good news is that once you find it, you are good to go and can reward yourself with a cold, fresh, beer.\n\nThere was a food truck the day we went that served up some tasty snacks.  A perfect combination on a day of relaxation.  Both the food vendor and the brewery staff were extremely nice.  The beer was good, the atmosphere was cool / industrial and we enjoyed our visit to Hog River.",
  "Very nice venue tucked away. Great for socializing and large venue. Good beer and sometimes have food trucks. Overall a great time ",
  "Real friendly and knowledgable staff.  Beers were good.  Wanted a dark one to try but the ones that they had were really good.  Love the ability to take it home in the cans that press right there.",
  "I came here with a group of friends on a Friday night. They have a large list of beers on tap and many for purchase in cans. They also have games inside and a food truck outside. I had the cranberry maple stout and it was very interesting to try, but probably not something I'd get again. The games were a little beat up, but what can you expect in a brewery? :) Overall a nice visit.",
  "What I like most besides their great beers was the fact they serve wine, because not everyone Iikes beer.  It is an old warehouse & there\u2019s plenty of room to spread around.  If you get board there is an axe throwing establishment in the same building.",

I heard about this location but didn't find it easily online (Google really wanted to send me to the original location), but I am so glad I visited as it's a great spot in the city! ",
  "We stopped at Thomas Hooker Colt today for a quick visit. Saturday afternoon, there was a few people outside on the patio which has a nice view of Hartford and the Colt building(s). Lots of parking. There is a good selection of TH beers at a good price. $5 pints mostly!! they do have food from a nearby restaurant which you can order at the bar and delivered to your table. I would recommend stopping by!",
  "Visited for a farewell gathering. I don\u2019t drink beer or ale, their drink selection was excellent, food was delicious and the outdoor seating was a fun and friendly environment. Next time I visit I\u2019m bringing my dogs because it\u2019s also dog friendly!!",
  "Lots of stouts on tap!! Thicc AF was super smooth, barell aged which was great! Reindeer and Peanut Slayer also awesome! Will definitely come back. 4 5oz flight for $8",
  "Stopped in before Zac Brown concert. Nice and low key. Good beers, fun atmosphere, service was good. Will stop back again. Regular bar was good for my wife as she does not like beer.",
  "The location is amazing the beers were good did a tasting and the small bites to eat were really nice.  The staff was great and really chill.",
  "Good atmosphere at taproom. Good variety of beers. I had a flight of IPAs. Staff is friendly and laid back. Lots of good places to sit or stand",
  "Went and tried a few of their samples and didn't find any that were appealing. They had small bites so you can't bring your own food. "

  "Check groupon to see if you can get a deal for visiting in a group.  Their facilities are small, but when you first come in, there is a small bar area you can order cocktails and buy bottles to take home.  In the back, you can do a tour and tasting at a designated time \u2013 the tasting takes place in the production room and that counts as the tour too.  You will be able to have a small sample of all of the flavors they sell.  Their liquors are all sweet and can be sipped on their own or mixed with a juice or soda for a great cocktail.  They have some very interesting flavors you probably wont see often, but the best is the Chai Spice.",

  "We had a great time at Hartford Flavor Company.  We had purchased a Groupon for a tasting and tour.  It was a very good value for the tasting of all of their liquors, small snacks (pretzels, corn chips) on the tables, a tour of the production area, as well as a complimentary mixed drink.  The staff were exceptionally kind and very welcoming.  I think it's also great how committed they are to gluten free and non-GMO ingredients.\n\nWhat stands out to us at Hartford Flavor Company was the unique flavor line of their Wild Moon Liquors.  Each one was exceptionally delicious without being overly sweet.  Between the birch, chai spice, cranberry, cucumber, lavender, rose, and lime I'd honestly say they are all excellent.  I would venture to note that the rose and lavender were most unique.  The cucumber was deliciously refreshing as well.  \n\nWe also savored our cocktails.  My husband had the Blissful Botanist and I had the Ginnovation.  They were mixed perfectly and we loved the flavor combinations.\n\nIf you are seeking a niche liquor experience and enjoy some delicious cocktails Hartford Flavor Company is well worth the visit.  Your biggest challenge will be which liquor flavor you decide to bring home!",
  "Flavor infused alcohol- nice tour, interesting drinks with amazing flavors- had lavender Prosecco. The flavors and aromas are fantastic",
  "I went here with my best friend for my birthday, we used a groupon.  This was a lot of fun. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and tell some great stories while giving the tour. The cordials were all fantastic.  After the tour we both enjoyed a drink with our favorite cordial.  It was a really nice time, great thing to do with your friends or as a couple.  They have all the flavors bottled in various sizes for you to purchase at very reasonable prices.   I got the lime and have since put it with my G n T's and I love it!  Great place to visit and I will be back, those little bottles will make great gifts too.",
  "We enjoy visiting distilleries and we were unsure about a liqueur tasting. It was amazing!! It\u2019s NOT your parents sickly sweet liqueur.  Interesting story about how the company came to be. The tasting is well thought out, great progression.  Helpful recommendations, delicious cocktail at the end of the tour. We purchased 2 liqueurs, lime and cranberry.  Added both to fresh lime juice, agave and tequila for a delicious margarita! ",

  "Amazing staff.  Simply amazing.  And the archives are beyond amazing when researching Connecticut history.  If nothing else, just stop by and browse the collections, some of which are extremely old and require wearing gloves to view.  Amazing for true historians, especially for the Revolutionary War period and Connecticut's role...",
  "This is THE place to study Connecticut history and genealogy. Their collections are unparalleled, much of it unique. The staff is friendly and helpful. Do walk upstairs to the law library and the wonderful small museum. Can't beat the price, which is free!",
  "Across Capital Avenue from the State Capitol is a building housing the State Library and Archives, the State Supreme Court, and tucked away, a wonderful museum.  The Colt gun display alone is worth the trip, but there is much else to see.",
  "Come here after visiting the state capital across the street. This museum has a wide collection of Colt firearms and other Connecticut made products. There was a temporary exhibit 'Frisbie to Frisbee' about how Connecticut Frisbie pie pans were thrown around and eventually evolved into the frisbees of today.",
  "The staff is extremely helpful in finding documents and providing a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.  Lockers are available to protect your stuff.  The library has an extensive collection of Connecticut newspapers on microfilm as well.  Great for researching obituaries and events of the time period you are researching!!",
  "Staff in the archives were kind and helpful. They provided lockers for my stuff while I was there. I was able to view original records from the Civil War period. They offered any help they could provide and it made for a short but productive trip through the archives.",
  "Ct State Archives is an Excellent resource for finding out information about your Family History. The Staff is very friendly and helpful as they assist you in navigating the Archive Records and using the microfilm and newspapers. They have a large card catalog of The Barbour Collection,Newspapers, Teanscriptions of headstones and more. They're open during the week and on Saturday's from 9a-2pm.",
  "Came here to do some genealogy research on some of my CT roots.  Mel, the librarian, was extremely helpful and forthcoming with suggestions for searches.  He walked us around the library to show us the locations of the various collections.  He showed us how to utilize their particular computer for newspaper research, etc. which we very much appreciated.  Many of the archives records are online at Ancestry, for example, but not all so it's definitely worth a visit to see what else they have in their collections.  When I called in the morning to ask about parking, I was informed there was paid on street parking or, if I wanted to walk a bit further, there was free parking in the legislator's parking structure which is just west of the State Capitol, up a small street which loops to the right (back towards the Capitol) where you'll then see the structure entrance.  You end up walking about 2.5 blocks.  The Archive building does have a security screening as you come into the building.  Overall, it was well worth the visit and I really appreciate the excellent help of the staff."
