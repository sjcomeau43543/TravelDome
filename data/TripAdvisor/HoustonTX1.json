  "Luckily we visited the Museum on a Thursday when it is free entry for anybody after 2pm! There were no queues and the exhibits inside weren't that busy. There was plenty to look at and for a free experience it was very good, however I don't think it's worth the usual entry price. Nevertheless there is still lots to do and the exhibits are well maintained and detailed. We didn't attend any of the 'extra' exhibits, and in total we spent around 2 hours there. If you can go on a Thursday I would thoroughly suggest a visit.",
  "Great place to take the family. Butterfly\u2019s everywhere. Lush landscaping. A wonderful learning experience.",
  "Museum was great.Is good for all age,very educational. They only think  I didn't like is there is no food court,they just have some table to sit at the lobby.",
  "We enjoyed an annual family membership to HMNS. It has a convenient parking garage, lots of general admission exhibits and interesting special exhibits as well. It is an especially good venue during the summer, when the weather is hot outside, and the kids can spend the day inside, exploring different specimens and cultures.",
  "What a shock 20.00 to park! The museum is wonderful! To do the \u201cspecial exhibits \u201c it is very expensive! If you do just 2 of them it is 200.00 extra and there are more than 2! Not for budget minded families"

  "I live here in Houston but originally from NY, so i have 2 favorite baseballl teams. I must say of all the baseball parks I have been to around the country, Minute Maid is one of my favorite. Very clean and great food selection and many bars and restaurants in walking distance of the park. I also love the train that goes around the top of the park when the Astros hit a homerun. Cant wait to go back.",
  "Parking was easy with a quick shuttle to the field.  No problem walking up to buy tickets.  Just watch out for drips from the AC unit - we would definitely choose another section but options were limited that day.",
  "Take me out to the ball game. Such a great venue. It is clean and bright. The atmosphere is festive and fun.",
  "This is a great baseball venue. The seats are great and it is clean and well cared for.\nThe best thing is to take in a Astro's game whether it is during the day or at night.  They have a couple of tasty restaurants and of course snack bars. Their sport's shops have lots of great Astro memorabilia and sportswear. You don't need to worry about the weather because if it is too hot, they close the roof and keeps thing cool or if it rains, you stay dry.",
  "You must get here as soon as possible. Even if you aren\u2019t a baseball fan there\u2019s something for everyone"

  "I loved roaming the many galleries of European art, from the Medieval to contemporary. I  was also amazed at the amount of East Asian, Indian, and Islamic art they had as well. This might be a two day trip though, it's easy to get \"visual fatigue\" in a place like this.",
  "We went to Norman Rockwell exhibit.  was amazing and enjoyed the history lesson from early days, thru wars and peace.",
  "Our first trip to the Museum of Fine Arts was a most enjoyable experience.  We were thoroughly impressed with the way we were introduced to a few works and were immediately directed through a striking and sobering photo exhibit of the Great Depression and World War II that gave great insight to Rockwell\u2019s work and caused us to study the remaining pieces even closer than we would have.  \n\nSince we only saw his nostalgic and humorous works when we were children, it was wonderful to see the serious subject matter toward the end of the exhibit.  It is not that human behavior changed from 1930 to the 1970s; how he was allowed to paint it changed dramatically. That man really laid his emotions on the canvas and the museum did a fine job of showing us why.  ",
  "We are members and went to see the Rockwell exhibit  and the Spanish treasures exhibit.  Both were very good.",
  "Went here by chance as the natural history and science museum was closed for the day. Lovely place. Had some heat paintings but also exhibits from Italian furniture to Egyptian, Japanese,  Indonesian exhibits. WEL worth a few hours of your time "

  "This plase I reconmend for all families. The games were awsome for the kids to play. We had a wounderfull time.Be prepared to stay for a while.",
  "I was very surprised at all the hands on activities for the children. Our grandchildren, ages 10 - 18, LOVED it!",
  "There are 3 floors with about 20 different sections. Most are best for ages 4-7 Although the toddler area upstairs was good, there isn\u2019t much to do fur small kids like our 2 year old daughter so I think it should be cheaper for 2-3yr olds. Good activity for a rainy day. ",
  "Depending on your view I tend to think of Museum as about the past but this children's exploratory uses gadgets galore to teach kids physics, chemistry, motor skills with careers and STEM guidance dotted around for good measure.  The huge climbing net at the back of the building I'd not seen before but created a great space for physical development, there were exhibits and try outs on physics, chemistry, visual holograms where staff helped to create your own hologram and Kidtropolis virtual city to try out different careers and act out different roles with your souvenir Kid Card also acting as your ATM card.   So much to do at a surface level we only had three hours and it really wasn't enough but you do get three hours free parking at the neighbouring park and their annual passes are good value.   We went on a regular school day for the US so it was lively but not really busy and that probably improved the experience as we could try everything without waiting for exhibits.   I'd happily go back again and again because each section deserves its own concentrated time, my only suggestion to the really very friendly staff would be perhaps to consider producing a guide sheet, even online for parents to help them get the best for their children from the visit - there are some who just want a place to burn off excess energy but if you want to look at STEM careers or develop curiosity the place has so many options,  Houston's a lucky city to have this place."

  "I Am Bruce the zoo guy and I've been to around 120 zoos and aquariums around the country. This is my review of the Houston Zoo. First off this zoo has one of the greatest elephant exhibits. it has 3 parts and is very large. i like that they also updated their primate section. they have a section on texas wetlands too.\n the gorilla section is very well done. admissiin is $23 for adults. parking is free, though fills up early. easily traversed paths  with lots of shade. cool n unique lion exhibit with cool tunnel. lots of places to eat. sea lion exhibit is sad as they only have one sea lion, poor fella. see pics of my experience",
  "I have visited many zoos across the country and I was very disappointed in many aspects of this zoo. Limited parking full early. Police of no assistance in directing us to other options. Finally saw a sign for additional parking but it cost $10 and required a shuttle. Upon leaving we waited for 45 minutes to board a shuttle and eventually called Uber. Upon entering, the only restrooms were port o potties with no where to wash your hands. Did find a hand sanitizer station. Exhibits were OK but extra charges for one exhibit. $7 charge for 3 lettuce leaves to feed the giraffes. $5 charge for  a medium size soft drink. Directional signage was poor. Not worth the money and hassle.",
  "We had a great time! A lot of new/redone exhibits were opened so we were able to see a lot. They seem to have even more plans of redoing things as some areas where the birds were had been closed. The elephants were probably our favorite and we got some great photos. The food wasn\u2019t too expensive and was pretty good. \nParking is difficult so get there early. \nThis was included in our Houston CityPASS!",
  "Great day event for children. A wide variety of animals - very informative for young and old. Food/Beverage good for snacks. Well maintained and exciting for all."

  "My wife and I spent the entire day there and did not get a chance to see everything. I highly recommend an early start to your day.  The entire space center was amazing to see. History does come to life (my wife and I were in grammar school when the space race was occurring). \nHere is how we rated what we saw:\nOrion tour - excellent \nMission control - excellent \nAstronaut training - good\nSpace shuttle transport- excellent \nMuseum - excellent \n\nWe did not have the opportunity to see most of the movies since the tours are all very lengthy \n\nThis is a MUST if visiting Houston ",
  "As a huge fan of anything space related, particularly the early Mercury-Apollo missions l, this was a superb visit and I wished I\u2019d had longer\n\nThe first thing to do is get on the tram which takes you on a tour of mission control, the training facility and the Saturn V rocket.  A word of warning the Apollo Mission Control is on a separate tour so allow yourself time if you want to see this - I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m still kicking myself\n\nThe shuttle carrying 747 with mock-up shuttle is great as is the indoor displays where you can touch a price of the moon and Mars!\n\nAs the title says, don\u2019t pass through Houston without visiting ",
  "To get to the Space Center we had to use public transport from downtown Houston. Despite the Space Center being a main attraction there is a very infrequent bus service to the location, however this must be because demand is low as the bus wasn't actually that full. We got the 249 which took about 1 hour and was very cheap; just $1.25 each, one-way.\nWe bought tickets for the attraction online to avoid any qeues but also because you can generally find a discount of around 5-10% online so it is worth a look. We walked straight in without a problem and were greeted by a large exhibition hall. There was so much to do here that we could've spent half a day just looking around, this included talks and shows. We visited the Cinema show which was good and got pictures with the lectern used in JFK'S infamous \"We choose to go to the moon\" speech. We didn't have anytime to eat anything at the food court which was in the main area as there was so much else to do.\nWe went on the tram tour which was a highlight. Despite having to wait about 45 minutes to board it was certainly worth it as the tour is highly detailed and you get to see awesome locations like Mission Control. We stayed all day right until closing and then got the last bus back.",
  "We went inside the mission control area which was dark and quiet. I was sitting in the front with several family members and a sleeping toddler on my lap. A  woman with a microphone came and stood right in front of me and yelled at all of us in a very mean voice about how we need to be very quiet. This scared the crap out of all of us and woke and scared my child who began to fuss. She then raised her voice and increased the nastiness of her tone and repeated the warning. I comforted and silenced my child in less than three seconds and still this woman went on screaming. Beyond that I found everything about the place relatively boring and we had been to the zoo and the museum the day before which were enjoyable.",
  "We took the VIP tour. It was great. We arrived  1 hour before an went in as soon as they opened.  We went through the turnstiles and to the right.  This is where we picked up our badges.  Then we went exploring until our tour.  We saw the plane and the shuttle.  you can go into both.  We saw he moon rock and touched it.  We looked at may other exhibits and listened to a talk.  Then we got with our group for the VIP tour.  They loaded us onto and air conditioned van and off we went.  We toured building 13 and the swimming pool (an astronaut and divers were in it).  We had lunch at the normal cafeteria (they give us a $16 voucher each).  We went to 2 mission control centers.  Then we stopped to see the Saturn 5 rocket.  Along the way we saw the Longhorns.   I am so glad we did this tour.  I feel I have a better understanding of our space programs past and current.  Thank you Dave!"

The seats were arranged so that we didn't have to peek over anyone but I highly recommend bringing a stadium seat cushion for comfort, they are not padded that well and sitting made us numb",
  "Very organised entry with some security but still quick. Some food and beverage retail inside with limited choices and fixed prices. Our seats were on 480 and it\u2019s narrow and fairly steep and the seat leg room is short, everyone managed ok though. Restrooms were clean and plentiful. There was a family room which was locked. The exit procedure was pretty smooth and quick and outside the police moved cars very quickly.\nThe acoustics were amazing and the lighting, we had a great time watching and listening to the eagles.",
  "One of my highlights for the duration of my stay in Houston!\n\nBooked a tour and game, it did not disappoint. Unfortunately because I was outside the US I was not able to book on their website, with just a quick email to the Toyota Centre, Ryan, the Group Event Executive got in touch and sorted it all out for us. Excellent service. Within a couple of days, we had paid and confirmed our place on a tour of the Toyota Centre and a ticket to the Rockets v Knicks game. \n\nWhen we arrived for our tour, we were in a small group of about 7-8 people. The tour lasted about an hour and a half (if I remember rightly) and we were taken to pretty much all backstage areas as well as the court. After the tour we were given passes to the pre-game warm up and tickets to our match.\n\nWe came back at 5.30pm for the pre-game warm up, entry was quick and organised. Just before the game started we walked around, there were lots of competition and give aways, the event is well organised and the atmosphere is fantastic. The game was brilliant with lots going on in breaks. It was my first basketball match and will always remember it. All for just $40.\n\nBig shout out to Ryan and the team for a fabulous day! To top it all off, The Rockets beat the Knicks that night!",
  "Never been to a live basketball game before, and this was definitely the place to start. It wasn't even basketball season but it was amazing to watch and experience. Everyone was really friendly and even though we were up high you can clearly see the whole court. We booked our tickets on stubhub and they were only $14 USD each.",

Overall great value for a phenomenal time. ",

It is similar to a State Fair up north but with Rodeo entertainment in addition to nightly concerts, carnival attractions, livestock, art, shopping and of course food!

The Goode Company BBQ booth took care of us by changing gloves, cleaning the knife, and preparing her food on a different surface. We ordered brisket for her (no sauce) and she was able to enjoy the concert to celebrate her birthday. Thank you so much!! Please pass this message along. This attention to detail made our day, and kept the birthday girl from getting very sick. As a parent, I appreciated the caring attitude and attention this group showed our family.",

I was in the Pitmaster tent and the food was amazing.  the tent had so much action, just like the rest of the tents. It was my first time having a fried twinkie and fried oreo.

  "I really debated between and 3 and a 4.  I was disappointed that the only parking we could find was the $3 for 15 minute parking.  The area was super busy (we were there on a Friday evening) and we didn't want to drive in circles looking for the supposedly free Galleria parking.\nThe area right in front of the feature was extremely muddy due to the spray coming off of the wall.  I'm glad we went and walking all the way around the back of the wall was worth it as well.  There were several people doing photo shoots with lighting and all, so it was hard to get photos without people or equipment in the photos.\nOne other warning, use Waze or something that keeps up to date with construction changes with your GPS because we ended up being forced onto a freeway when the way we wanted to go was closed. Luckily, we didn't have to be anywhere, so we took it as an excuse to explore another area."

  "An amazing gardens, house and property with lovely walking paths.  Beautiful decor inside with excellent workmanship.  Highly recommend.",
  "My friend and I decided to explore this place. For about $13, we were given access for a self guided tour of the house and gardens. There is a lot to explore and you need maybe 3 hours to explore the majority of it if you walk at a decent pace. On the third Sunday of every month, it's free admission. Enjoy!",
  "The Christmas decorations were extensive and delightful.  Staff were very helpful.  The play that was going on in the house was fun. Children were having fun. Music and trains were in a large tent."

  "Good size museum and free! The outside area is nice so it\u2019s perfect for a beautiful day. They have a wide range of art and you could spend 20 mins there or 2 hours!",
  "Great place, but not open last I visited.  Major remodeling work going on.  Can\u2019t wait to see how it comes out.",
  "The Menil is free to the public and has free parking, so it is definitely worth checking out. That being said, it houses a wide, odd assortment of 'art', including unsettling depictions of the human form. I visited with my husband and our youngest child, and I decided to steer our 5 yr old away from the photography and toward the more traditional pieces.",
  "This is a small museum and everything is top quality.  It's free and they absolutely are vigilant about stopping you from taking photos--there is a guard in every single room and their main activity is catching folks who want to take photos!\n\nIt's amazing to think that the place is free but they pay about 40 room monitors.   \n\nNonetheless, the exhibits--especially the african art--are top quality.   If you are interested in basketweaving skills, you won't find a better selection than this place.   It isn't baskets, it's the hair and other features on the African displays that use this craft.",
  "This was a great visit. There was a wide variety of modern art. The collection of ancient artifacts was very well- curated.  We were only able to visit the main building, but will visit the others on our next visit into the city. "

  "Took the time to go see this park. It has so much to offer.\nWe did the water building first which was an eye opener.\nAfter spending time underground listening to the history of the water of Houston we then started on our walk of the park. We first went on top of water building then took the track south of the riverside. So much to see and photograph. After 3 hours or so we had only gone half way. So we still need to do the rest.\nThe negative was no access to a drink or bite to eat at the location. Has so much to offer for both the locals and tourists.",

  "Even if you don't drink a lot of beer the facility is amazing and the tour is very good. You must be 21+ to do the tour and you need to pre-register but it is really worth it,",

  "While some museums are static examples of aircraft, the coolest part about this museum is most of the planes either do fly or are capable of flying. If you always wanted to fly in a bi-plane...you can sign up for a ride in the one you\u2019re looking at. I\u2019ve gone for several rides in old warbirds throughout the country as a member of the CAF and this place offers similar amazing experiences. You are literally able to view and fly history. The location is great too since NASA has its training aircraft housed nearby. I would recommend this museum for all ages. We\u2019ve seen kids loving life walking around the planes, senior citizens reminiscing, folks bringing their parents in to have them show which planes they helped build during WWII, and people like myself who just love the history and beauty of the exhibits. If you\u2019re from out of town or a local, stop by...it\u2019s a great experience!",
  "Had last visited the Lone Star Flight Museum when it was still based in Galveston and it has fairly recently moved to Ellington to be more protected from hurricane damage. Their collection of flying warbirds is impressive and should not be missed if you are anywhere around Houston. The new premises are well laid out and you can still be up and close to these beautifully maintained aircraft. Noticed that the museum does a lot of STEM work with the local schools which keeps the love of aviation alive! ",
  "The museum has free  parking. When I visited, admission was paid in the gift shop. There are several aircraft on exhibit. There is a good history of aviation in general and Texas aviation in particular. There is also a \"hall of fame\" of Texas aviators which has some recognizable and surprising members. There are conference rooms within the facility for special events.",
  "You need to check on which Mondays as it is not every Monday.  Great displace of planes in 2 hangars.  Check it out.",
  "We visited this museum after it was moved from Galveston to Ellington Field and we can tell you the museum managers did an awesome job.

The restroom is in the nature center building, which is adjacent to both parking lots.  This is not a botanical garden, just a forest with meadows, there are interpretive exhibits here and there and we caught wildflowers in bloom.  Dogs are welcome on a leash and you will see many.  Visiting is free but there is a small charge for parking.  Highly recommended.",
  "Nice place to escape from the city. Several trails to walk or jog. Lots of nature,  lots of wildlife, but ultimately not an attraction or zoo. So if you enjoy hiking and bird watching, it's a nice place to go. ",
  "We wanted a bit of nature on our trip to Houston and this place fit the bill perfectly.  There is a lot of construction going on there currently and it had rained, so things were a bit muddy but still it was absolutely beautiful. We went to the nature center and met with a wonderful woman (did not catch her name) who went over the map of trails with us and let us know which trails would be best for our family's needs.  We went on a mixture of 6 different trails.  We got so many beautiful pictures and we saw tons of turtles.  We were advised to seek out the Owl bridge, it was pretty cool but we couldn't get a good pic of us with it in the background.  Great visit, small slice of heaven in middle of a bustling city."

Four hours should be plenty of time to visit the museum. After you pay your admission, the short orientation film is recommended. It recycles every 20 minutes and there is a countdown clock outside the theater. The museum has guided tours and audio tours available. It is a detailed history of the Nazi holocaust in Europe, There are several recorded interviews of local residents who were survivors of the holocaust. It is something that everyone should be reminded of, lest we allow it to happen again. There is a gift shop.",

  "I haven't been to any of the Holocaust Museums around the country so this was my first experience. Beginning in the beautiful theater room and hearing their voices and stories was an excellent introduction. Of course the entire museum is a moving and powerful experience. They have made it personal and brought it to life. I was struck by the use of he railroad car as a bridge to another section. The size and time spent are about right for the gravity of the topic. Don't miss the area outside the main doors with the stone blocks beside the sidewalk.",
  "A thoughtful museum to learn about the events leading to the Holocaust as well as the horrors, and those who resisted and aided.  A lot to absorb. Video on 2nd floor was good if you have energy. Two hours was plenty for us.\n\nMuseum is well organized for visual and auditory learning. If you enjoy reading, I would skip the audio tour.  Food options very limited there.  Lucilles nearby is a good alternative."

  "Looking at the prices compared to what you actually get for it, I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. We went because it was included in our CityPASS. What we saw was nice but this is a \u201cfor profit\u201d aquarium. Most of them are in tanks too small for them. Their poor bengal tigers hardly have space to live comfortably. The inside area is a decent size but the outside is terribly small. I\u2019m not sure why they have tigers at all as this is supposed to be an AQUARIUM. But also a gift shop, restaurant and carnival??? It\u2019s just a very odd combination of things that don\u2019t fit well together. You have to pay extra for everything as well, they need it to be a more inclusive price. ",
  "I would not waste my money coming to this aquarium. It is super small super fast from start to finish last about ten minutes . Have been to the one in Corpus and San Antonio this rates way at the bottom .  Waste of money and they really need to expand . The tanks are very small for the fish displayed even my two kids we had made comments how little space the fish had in the tanks . The Tiger which was not on  display. Very disappointed when asked if I could come back later to see it when it was I was told no since I didn\u2019t purchase the wristband . So beware if you buy the city pass this does not include the only other exhibit worth seeing the sharks . You have to purchase separate ticket or upgrade . I think that is really ridiculous considering that the aquarium is so small then to see the sharks it\u2019s extra . Why would you charge extra if that is part of the aquarium.  Not complaining and completely understand to charge more for the rides but not the shark exhibit. Might  be fun if you have kids five and under only . Other then that do not waste your time like we did .\n\nDisappointed \u2639\ufe0f",
  "This is the smallest aquarium I have ever seen. Cool exhibits, but where is the rest? They were doing construction, so I am hoping that they are planning to expand. The exhibits they did have were good, but the white tiger looked like he was sedated. I was wondering why the gift shop was near the beginning of the walk when I realized that was the end. The only thing after the gift shop is the stingwrays, which you can feed if you like. There is a restaurant if you want to dine there. I definitely would have been mad if we had paid to park.",
