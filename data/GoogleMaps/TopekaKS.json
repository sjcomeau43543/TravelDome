   "I visit Gage Park often. There are paved walking trails perfect for mommy n me  with strollers, seniors, and dog walkers. Beautiful flower gardens in the spring through winter make for a photographer's dream. The antique merry-go-round is a must see and the train is every child's desire. The dog park is a safe place with separate areas for large and small dogs.",
   "I grew up in Topeka and have always loved this park. I love how they have kept the cool old stone play area, but have also added new fun things. We love to stop by the park when we visit. My kids love it too.",
   "Lots of renovation here. In spring the flowers and trees are beautiful. This is s great place for photography. The zoo is improving and we always LOVE the little train.",
   "The greatest park I've ever been to,  to include major metropolitan parks.   Great playgrounds,  great facilities, beautiful.   The mini train was a big part of my childhood when I visited here as a child,  now its my daughter's favourite thing.",
   "Great place. Lots to do and see. The zoo there is great for it's size.a great stop when you are in Topeka"

   "This Grandma recommends it! Our grandson's birthday party was fantastic. They have an excellent events room you can rent and it includes admission for all of your party guests. There were so many activities - indoors and out -  for ALL of the kids - big and small. We had children 1 thru 12 with us. Plus, the adults had just as much fun discovering as the kids.",
   "A lot of fun STEM activities for the kids! Great staff! A cool place to spend time with your entire family!",
   "Great place to go for the kiddos year round, they usually have updated areas. 100 bucks gets a family 1 year of access. They have indoor and out door play areas. Great for all weather conditions.",
   "Absolutely love this place. We are there a couple times a month and always have to pull the kids away. Got a membership and just drop in or used it as a pit stop while one of us goes to the grocery store.",

   "We went on a Saturday so there were few visitors, which was great. We took the Historical tour, which I recommend. Our guide was knowledgeable and shared many facts and anecdotes which made our visit exponentially more interesting than if we just wandered around. It was basically a private your. Two of our friends joined my husband and me for the tour and there was only one additional couple in our group.\n\nI buried the lead because the Capitol is quite beautiful. The renovation was done very well and the visitor center is a wonderful addition.\n\nWe parked in the underground garage, and again since it was Saturday it wasn't  crowded. \n\nMy husband and his friend took the tour to the top of the dome. They enjoyed it. I am glad we visited the Capitol building. If you are a Kansan and haven't been,  I recommend adding it to your  \"to-do\" list.",
   "Absolutely beautiful building that's almost entirely accessible at all times. There's a wonderful new visitors center with lots of displayed history that you can walk through before entering the main atrium. You can wander to all the buildings floors and get awesome views from up near the dome to the floor looking up. As a Kansans it's a great place to visit and see where everything happens.",
   "Great place to spend an afternoon in any season. Have time to plan ahead, call and set up a guided dome tour. Clean facility and well-organized exhibits. Knowledgeable and helpful personnel. Gift and curios. Free to the public.  *Conference rooms can be reserved for a variety of social events.*",
   "The\u00a0Kansas State Capitol, known also as the\u00a0Kansas Statehouse, is the building housing the\u00a0executive\u00a0and\u00a0legislative\u00a0branches of government for the\u00a0U.S. state\u00a0of\u00a0Kansas. Located in the city of\u00a0Topeka, which has served as the capital of Kansas since the territory became a state in 1861, the building is the second to serve as the Kansas Capitol.\nThe dome, at 304\u00a0ft (93\u00a0m), is taller than the 288\u00a0ft (88\u00a0m)\u00a0United States Capitol dome, although its diameter (50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m)) is approximately half that of the national capitol (96\u00a0ft (29\u00a0m)). It is one of the few capitols in the United States that continue to offer tours that go to the top of the dome.\u00a0Visitors enter the dome by climbing 296 steps leading from the fifth floor to the top.",
   "Had the opportunity to visit when I was a senior in high school. I knew I would come back some day. Manifestation at its finest when I earned the opportunity to work on Capitol Hill as an adult. Tour guides are excellent. Such a great way to learn more about our nation. A must do when in DC!"

   "This is a gem to visit. We happened to drive by on our way back to Kansas City and wanted to pull over to eat a meal we bought. We found a picnic table by the edge of the pond. Then we decided to take a quick walk around the garden which turned out to be most amazing manicured sanctuary. We loved the paths or trails, the abundance of flora and water falls. The back drop of the lake was very relaxing to enjoy an afternoon.",
   "Beautiful gardens and walking paths. I take my dogs here whenever I can. We walk near the lake, watch the boats, watch the people fishing. There are ball diamonds and soccer fields nearby, pic nic places and playgrounds. A must see for the whole family.",
   "Beautiful place to take a leisurely stroll, stop and smell the flowers, have a date, read a book, or sit and relax/meditate. You could even have a lovely photo shoot or possibly a small wedding! It was a great spot to just be able to relax and enjoy the scenery. My kids absolutely loved it even though one of them wasn't too excited about going in the beginning. By the time we left, he said he really enjoyed it and can't wait to come again, especially when the tulips will be in bloom!",
   "The most beautiful spot in Topeka! The gardens are always maintained and the lake is clean and beautiful. We even had our wedding reception there. Everyone couldn't stop talking about how beautiful the gardens are. It was so lovely and we are so thankful that this place exists. Everyone should come here and stop to smell the flowers.",
   "We are from another city but decided to take family photos in the park. We were pleasantly surprised by the landscaping and appearance. This made for beautiful photos and a very fun family day. The views of the lake from the park are nice and many people seem to enjoy the flowers, ponds, and trails that permeate the park."

At first I was not pleased with the feeding the geese ban, but the sidewalks sure have been cleaner and you see less dead fish IMO. I like that you can jog the entire sidewalk trail and see people. It\u2019s open and has very few blind spots if any. I feel safe when I\u2019m jogging at Lake Shawnee.",
   "The park is nice...ball diamonds.. great walking ...went to look for a place to trout fish in the morning... good luck with that !!! Weeds...weeds ..& weeds....they need to do something with the water condition.... wish I could get a refund on my permit....I'm not going!!!",
   "Lake Shawnee is a great little man made lake on the SE side of Topeka. It has a concrete sidewalk going around the entire lake. The city/county have made tremendous improvements in the past 20 years! Beautiful gardens to walk through, abundant fishing, walking, biking around the lake, kayak and other rentals, golf,  tennis, sand volleyball,  playgrounds, camping.... the list goes on.",
   "Beautiful in the fall, kind of a hidden gem in Topeka. The lake is nice to boat and swim in. My issue between four and five stars is the rules for boating during the summer are too restrictive for the amount of lake available. I would like to see a better use of the lake. Surrounding the lake are parks, playgrounds, and campgrounds that allow for many hours of enjoyment.",
   "Beautiful neighborhood & the walking path by the lake is immaculate. Gorgeous everywhere... amazing large trees, the lake itself, willow, moss, bridges & architecture, all lovely. I just stopped when driving by and took a 10-minute walk, it is definitely an oasis that is perfect for rejuvenating. My Little Monster enjoyed it's also."

A learning center, a nice gift shop, a park, a petting zoo, and a little restaurant (who needs to serve french fries).  After the zoo, you can walk right across the street to play at the park, stroll through the rose garden (in season of course), fish in the pond or take a ride on the train or carousel.  Both the Zoo and the Park are wonderful places to take photos also.  I\u2019ve captured some of my very favorite pictures at the zoo.",
   "I love this zoo mainly for its size. You get to see a good variety of animals and dont feel completely dead at the end. I loved the newer building by the lions. It gives you a break from the elements and allows you a few of I think 3 different animals.",
   "This zoo is top notch! Their rain forest is full of very interesting birds. This one in particular will seem to try to dive-bomb unsuspecting visitors! Always an adventure!",
   "Because for a small city zoo, the staff make the most with what they have to work with. Animal care is top notch. The rainforest is amazing. The Zoo Camp each summer is a perennial favorite. My son has been going since he was 5 and still looks forward to it at 12.",
   "My all time favorite Zoo! It's on the smaller side but to me is the perfect size. No big hills to climb with your kiddos. Affordable. Clean. Always seem to be adding new exhibits."

   "My work had a little gathering there. The employees are awesome! The food was good. The atmosphere was was great. I love old historic places and they offered to take anyone who wanted on a tour. Loved it!",
   "Still pretty rustic,  but the show was great. Be prepared as like in dress appropriate to the outdoor conditions.  The existing HVAC is also rustic.",
   "The last surviving historic theater in town - someday it'll be beautiful again."

   "This Topeka overlook has always been popular. What has changed is that now you can't drive to the top anymore. You have to park then walk about a mile to get there. You can also ride a bike to the top provided you have very strong legs. I do have to say it's more peaceful without all the cars.",

   "The Powers that be Decided on their own without the Public's input to put a MASSIVE STEEL GATE at the top. So, you can no longer drive to the top and sit and enjoy OUR PARK and a STATE HISTORICAL SITE. THIS WAS VERY SNEAKY and done like a communist government.. This should not be allowed to stand. This WAS the best site and View in TOPEKA, It still could be if we demand it back !!  Please start contacting city officials.",
   "Lovely view, I used to take my daughters up there a lot.  There used to be a short trail at the bottom of it that didn't take long to get to the top.     Lately the ground hasn't been kept up with and it's no longer there.   We don't have enough time together to go the long way.  But it's very beautiful once you're up there. I'm surprised there's not many ppl there all the time.    Could use more upkeep  It's a chigger and snake sanctuary at the moment"

There are a variety of features along the trail such as statues of bison at the top of the Ad astera ascent where you can see the city of Topeka on the horizon, a replica cabin of the one the founders of Topeka spent a cold winter in until it burned, a tree fort you can climb up into, a pond with a dock, and a large tire swing. If I had grandkids I would definitely bring them.  My husband and I visited in March when the grasses were brown. It was still beautiful, but I'd love to go back in spring or early summer.",

Don't let the location fool you, I can tell a lot of care and attention has been given to them.\n\n     I look forward to experiencing them more on my journey to a healthier body and mind. \n\n    One of the best kept secrets of southeast Topeka.",

   "A buddy and I went on April 6th and it was perfect, there were so many jumps and trails to hit. This place is perfect for quads and dirtbikes",
   "Great place to ride atv, dirt bikes and even side by sides!!",
   "has good size parking that is before the riding trails. the trails are good size with jumps and mud pits when it has rained. some paths are wider than others but has multiple track paths  to ride on that are located in the woods. this is the coolest atv park we have seen."

   "A great art museum! Very educational - this Art Museum understands that's art should be experienced, but also put in perspective for those who don't I know much about it. There temporary exhibits are always very interesting. Always a stop when I'm in the Lawrence area.",
   "Excellent museum with a wide variety of exhibits to suit any taste. Parking right across the street and very inexpensive. Museum is free and open to the public.",
   "For a university museum, and the fact that the main gallery is free to visit, this is a must see. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and parking was free. I was surprised by the broad spectrum of art here. Plenty of contemporary pieces, various American pastoral works, 18th century European portraits, and a hodge-podge of Buddhist/Asian religious statues. Too must to list. It's not an extensive collection, but certainly a surprise."

It is so much more than truckhenge. There is also boathenge, knarlwood people, bottle walls, fairy gardens, lost soles forest, and a quarry with beach views.",

The owner cam out and gave me his spiel, then directions to the henge. Drove around the area and found the boat and truckhenge, which were really cool. \n\nHonestly, it's probably a 4 star due to how chaotic the area is, but you should see it before it's gone.

   "Enjoyed the show. But I felt theat more could have been done as far as signage and comfort goes. There weren't many signs to help navigate easily to where I needed to be. So I had to wait through two lines. When I only needed one. Other than that my only other complaint was the seats We rent comfortable. I kept having to adjust around to try to get comfortable. Concessions could have some more variety. I found the selection to be lacking.",

We spoke to an amazing park ranger named Dexter who met some of these famous individuals in the pictures. Be sure to ask for him. Wonderful place.",
   "I know this is a smaller park so I wasn't expecting much, but I was blown away! The school building itself is beautiful and well restored, the kindergarten classroom is really cool to see how things were when the room was in use, the exhibit rooms were amazing! I teared up walking through and reading some of the information. The exhibits go through the history of segregation, which is horrible, but very interesting to see. The ranger was very kind and accommodating and you could tell she really cared about the site and the information there. This is a fantastic place to visit if you are in the area, and if you aren't in the area it is with going out of your way to visit! Even my small children were interested. The kindergarten room, in addition to being informative, has blocked and other toys that the students would have used that children visiting can play with. The gift shop has lots of interesting books about segregation, Jim Crow, and Brown v. Board.",
   "A good place to pay your respects -- to the never-ending quest for equality for all -- if you're in the neighborhood. The pivotal Brown v. Board of Ed case began here in 1951 at Monroe School, where black students were sent in Topeka\u2019s segregated school system. Monroe, built in 1926, is well cared-for by the National Park Service, with several sober displays in former classrooms, and the auditorium. It\u2019s conventional stuff, but it never hurts to be reminded of how our society got where it is. The staff was friendly and attentive.",
   "March 2020. The museum provides a very clear historical perspective and judiciary timeline without too much technicality. Must see. Loved it.",
   "Learn everything about the historic Brown Vs Board of Education court decision. The place is stroller and toddler friendly. There is a kindergarten room with small desks and toys for kids to play with. You can see most of everything in an hour or less. \nAdmission is free. There is a gift shop."

   "I love this place! I've been coming to this beautiful park for well over 50 years, and still after all these many years every time I come I find something so beautiful I just want to share it with everyone. Yesterday was no different. From the mighty Oaks to Redwood's, trees of all shapes and sizes and in all different phases of their life span it's all so much beauty to behold! \n\nThe Forrest Park has quite a bit of history too, and from it's creation to now it has been well maintained and kept up in excellence by people who love the beauty it has to offer. And over the past few years they've even added more play equipment for children and a dog park for our furry friends too! So Forrest Park has something for everyone! A great pool, plenty of shelter to picnic in, a Frisbee course, Horse shoe court, baseball field and a paved walking path (have to share with vehicles) and so much beautiful grass to walk in, and lots of beautiful birds as well! check it out for yourself, I think you'll love it as much as I do!",
   "The best park in town. They do a lot of neat events here and the park is good sized. I took one star off because the city pool is here and they always close 1 month early every summer and also close at 6 PM so while the pool is there for residents to enjoy most who work don't get much chance to. I took another 2 stars off because ever since they put in the fenced in off leash area for dogs some people have become confused and let their dogs run around illegally off leash in the rest of the park. This is a huge safety concern as there are often a lot of families with small children about. Every dog is nice and safe until it isn't. Park needs better reinforcement of the dogs and also the motorists who speed. Otherwise the park is great. Love the horse shoe club too.",
   "So much fun for the grandbabies and myself. Lots of updated play equipment! We love this park!",
   "One of the best parks I've been in, each year they improve on something. They even have a Breast feeding and changing tent. I've never seen one in any other park. Great job Ottawa KS.",
   "Such a beautiful and peaceful park. So clean. Once walking trails as well"

(The show is in rotation the whole time) And free! I only went for the light show, so I'm afraid I can't comment on the whole place, but judging by this experience, I'd say it's a great place for families to have good, low-key fun.",

People are friendly, it's not over priced and they keep the place neat and tidy. If you ever have a chance to stop by the Overland Park area during the Christmas holidays, you have to do by and see the light show, fantastic!",

It is quite inexpensive to go to, during the week I believe it is free on certain days and on weekends its like $3 a person. Honestly, you do get your bang for your buck and it's a great way to pass a day. Would recommend!",

   "I have been going to the Arboretum since I was in high school. (I am 42 years old now) We went way back in the day, before it was all that it is now. No paved trails. Just the wood chipped trails, leading through the woods. It was just as tranquil and peaceful then as is it now. To see it now, you wouldn't even know it's the same place. It has definitely expanded and so many different little attractions, which have just added to it beauty and serenity. I love going here, to just walk, listen to music, be surrounded by nature in all of it's glory. It's the best way for me to clear my mind and make sense of the chaos in the world. It is truly so good for my soul. When I leave, I always feel refreshed and more focused with a clearer mind. I can't LOVE this place enough!",
   "Love this hidden gem! The Arboretum team obviously take pride and great care in their work.  The gardens and fountains are lovely especially in June...the Monet Garden is breathtaking...if you have kids, call ahead to see if the trains are running in the Train Garden! There are 4 miles of mulched hiking trails and peaceful, paved pathways throughout the gardens...a lovely cafe with yummy snacks and a gift shop where you can find an array of amazing and unusual gift items. The Arboretum has special events throughout the year that has become annual traditions for many!  As an added bonus, Tuesdays are free!",
   "Annually go for the luminary walk and it has been a fun and enjoyable experience each time. Walk through and see the gnome houses that are different each year then stroll the luminary area, other lights, trains, hay ride, and the beautiful reflections of decorated trees off the lake. Plus being out of main part of metro can see beautiful stars is the sky. Love going. Takes about 2 hours to leisurely walk through while also taking photos. Dress warm depending weather and while majority is a paved path could be small areas (not counting parking area) that depending might be muddy so consider that when choosing footwear when you visit.",
   "Came here for the first time yesterday for their annual luminary walk and I enjoyed it so much. Seeing the lights, gnome houses and hearing the water was so relaxing. They have areas where you can warm up if you happen to be out there on a chilly night like we did. The only thing I\u2019d recommend is for you to wear your most comfortable shoes, bring something hot to drink (they do provide that as well), gloves and/or hand warmers.",

   "Staff was overly friendly. Rooms were very clean. So many activities for young children. Little bit over priced (if you go on the weekends) but we went in winter so couldn\u2019t use the outdoor water park. They always have discounts online, we paid $100 for a family of 4 including a night in the hotel, 2 day water passes. Kids had an amazing time, you can also bring in your coolers to your hotel\nRoom which was very convenient. Seen a guy check into his hotel room at 11am instead of 4pm. So if your room is ready early you can get checked in early (which is super cool) unless you go on a weekend then except to be able to check in around 4pm. Will be going back for my sons 2nd birthday party. Kids 2 and under are free & I didn\u2019t know, I paid for 2 kids and was able to get my nephew in without paying for his wrist band because I already included 2 kids when booking online (my son was a year and a half) so I ended up paying for him when he was to get in free. Didn\u2019t get to try their food, brought our own food in. Over all great experience! I never write reviews and I probably won\u2019t ever again but thank you great Wolf Lodge for the amazing experience \u263a\ufe0f",
   "I usually don't write a review unless it's a great experience.  But, let me say this place is wonderful and the people that work here is AMAZING, very helpful and ALWAYS had a smile on their face. We had an awesome  breakfast server named Jordan and he went above and beyond for us, made sure we were taken care of. Needless to say, I will DEFINITELY recommend this place.  Thank you for making this a wonderful experience for my family. But, most of all thank you for making my daughter feel special on her birthday!",
   "We were just getting a drink at the food area and their was a gentleman there. We thought he was customer and told he to go ahead. He happen to be the GM. We had a wonderful conversation with him (Alex). It made our stay that much better. We have been to three Great wolf lodges (Texas, Minnesota and Kansas) and Kansas City is probably our favorite at the moment. You don\u2019t have to carry you tubes up the stair that is huge!!!!! The staff minus one have been wonderful and everyone had a bad day here and there. It has been great!!!",
   "Kids love it. Water park was great. We went midweek so not crowded. Be prepared to spend way more money than hotel rate. And driving Interstate 70 from st Louis was a nighmare both ways in January.  Missouri does not salt much and often shuts down due to accidents.",
   "We had a great time! Kids ages 12 down to 4 loved the water park. Room was good. The lifeguards are very well trained and aggressively scanning every bit of the water. There are two hot tubs to enjoy- the milder one that kids can play in also and the 18+ only one which was hot and quiet. The adult tub is somewhat secluded which is very nice for relaxing but does not allow for overwatch. One thing to keep in mind is that it is hard to see all of the park so plan ahead and setup meeting points with your kids so they know where to go if they panic and can't find you. We stayed two nights and by the end of the full day in the park my 12 year old was getting bored so I think 3 nights would have been too long.  It looks like there might be more to do with mini golf and an outdoor pool that open in warmer weather. \nOverall a great experience!"

   "This may be one of the last places to experience our Nation's great grassland. It was a very surreal experience to get away from the highway and be surrounded by nothing but nature. Grass, buffalo, a few trees, and you. The silence was deafening. Your voice left your body and was immediately swallowed up by nature. Eerie, beautiful, and totally like nothing else. The buffalo roam the park at will (fences keep them from leaving). They're huge and can be dangerous, and the park personnel (and signs) warn you of this. Be ready to hike on gravel roads. In 20 minutes you'll find out what this part of the country used to look like. The personnel are friendly and helpful. The displays are informative and present more info than you expect from a place like this.",
   "Fantastic place. Take the trail and you will see the bisons if you are lucky. Beautiful animals and the landscape is awesome. Very helpful ranger, Eric Patterson, at the visitor center. This is my favorite place in Kansas so far. A must see if you like nature and animals",
   "Went in mid October for a visit which is probably not the best time of the year as we are moving to fall but very enjoyable.  The visitor center was excellent and the park ranger working there was very knowledgeable and friendly.   We skipped the bison and farm house and went on the fox creek trail along with our dog.   We all had a good time and this six mile hike gave lots of views of different parts of the prairie. Made you really think back to when all the Midwest was prairie.  Definitely worth a visit",
   "Such a wonderful place to visit, I recommend to take the bus tour, that's a good way to see the majority of the park, it's almost of an hour tour inside and more chance to see the buffalos.\nThe house tours also very nice, and have a nice picnic area outside.\nIt's recommended to go visit in a few seasons just see the difference between the low grass in the grass",
   "My visit was for a passion of photographing night scenes around the Midwest and I had been here before I believe, but during the day. The preserve is easy to find and fully accessable. Some areas tend to close gates and assume nobody has interests after hours but this one seems open. Parking was apparent and I saw other facilities that would make this a great place to bring a family"

We made it through the whole zoo in a little over an hour however, it is priced very well and was enjoyable!! I would recommend any animal lover stop by and check it out. Good family fun!!",
   "Wonderful! I love this zoo. It is small enough that you won't get tired out before you finish but boasts a variety of animals that are well looked after. Staff is always nice and it's affordable. Great for families, there's a playground and they have a bunch of great volunteer and childcare programs, and they do birthday parties. Very very good zoo couldn't be more pleased",

The best thing about the Discovery center is that they are constantly changing what is being displayed, so every time that you come you learn something new!",
   "This was a fantastic experience for the entire family. The scavenger hunt for my 4 year old helped to keep her focused and interested on the main level exhibit. We watched the Flint Hills film. It was educational and we enjoyed the 4D effects. Upstairs, there are many play areas for little ones to enjoy. The limitless options for hands-on fun for the kids is well worth the visit. All of the staff was friendly and willing to answer any questions we had. My only complaint was the single-ply toilet paper in the restrooms. We did appreciate the foot stools for the kids though.",
   "My friend had a wedding reception here after Christmas! The decor was still up and looked great! This is a truly stunning venue.",
   "We visited the center expecting the typical kids education center experience. What suprised us most was the condition of the displays. Nearly every one of them was in good condition with only one needing some repair. We also enjoyed the amount of information and the way it was presented. They have plenty of facts designed to stand out to the children while still providing much more information for the adults to read as they walk through. At the time we visited, they had a travelling exhibit called \"Rainforest Adventure\". The kids in the exhibit were definitely on their best behavior but in spite of that, it was still in good condition and very informative. Having the information in the form of a maze was very interesting. Outside of the information and the exhibits, the staff was very helpful without coming across as overbearing or \"stuffy\". It appears that the facility was either recently built or recently remodeled. In either case, it was very clean and comfortable to visit. If we happen to be in the area we will keep this in mind as a good place to spend some time and gather additional information on the Flint Hills.",
   "Absolutely amazing! The kids area in the second floor was so perfect for our 2.5 year old :D The main exhibits were very educational and relatable since they were all about local science and history. The gardens on the rooftop were icing on the cake :)"

Each time we have ordered the chef's tasting menu and it's fun to see what different flavors they put together. The only glitch that I have noticed, so to speak, is they are a little heavy on the salt (for my taste buds) with a few of their dishes. Other than that the whole experience was positive and we will be choosing the Rowhouse to celebrate future occasions.",
   "It was an interesting place. Not super easy to find. It has charm. The food was interesting. Definitely not average. I didn't leave hungry, but next time I'm ordering something else.",
   "My wife and I went here for a date night as a chance to get dressed up and do something different. We were immediately greeted at the door and taken to a table. The experience was very personal and the house is small enough to feel cozy and comfortable. The food was absolutely amazing. From start to finish every piece was outstanding. Definitely worth the trip.",
   "Rowhouse is great! Not only is it an amazing date night spot but lunch is a great and affordable outing. Also they are amazing people at Rowhouse. They do so much to give back to the community. Like Vegan Fest! All the proceeds went to the Mission. Such a fantastic place! Oh! They also are great at catering to people with food allergies! My sister is allergic to soy, wheat, and mustard and Rowhouse is always willing (with joy) to make her dinner safe for her to eat. I cant say it enought they are amazing at Rowhouse.",
   "Rowhouse has an incredible atmosphere and quite a surprise for downtown Topeka.  The lunch menu was excellent with fresh produce and an amazing tomato soup.  It's in an old row home with multiple levels of dining.  Looking forward to hanging out on the patio when spring comes and enjoying listening to a local band."

   "Best BBQ in Kansas... I can say that because most KC BBQ is technically in Missouri. The only real downside to Lonnie's is the limited hours open. Even so it is definitely worth it to go for the cheesy potatoes alone. Simple menu, efficient interior design, clean facilities, awesome staff. There is literally nothing to dislike about any Lonnie Q's experience.",

It was amazing, I also had a bit of my dining partners brisket and pork. So good! I haven't had all the BBQ that's to be had in Topeka, but I have a hard time thinking it can get any better in Shawnee County.",

   "We were driving through Topeka, KS and stopped at this place for lunch on Easter, as it was open. We\u2019ve been to Thailand many times, and the food was extremely authentic. The server was the only one in the restaurant due to the holiday, but she still provided amazing and quick service. Overall a great experience - definitely get their appetizer sampler and their Tom yum soup, and drunken noodles!!",
   "This is one of the few restaurants in Topeka where we can get really good vegan food. The service is exceptional, acknowledging and helping us with ordering vegan foods. \nI had the crispy vegetable rolls. And we both had entrees with loads of veggies and tofu. The price is reasonable and the food tasty and filling. \nIf you are looking for somewhere to eat that has vegan choices and helpful staff in Topeka Tuptim Thai is the place to go.",
   "Delicious food with many options. Great for vegetarians too. Almost any dish can be optioned with tofu.",
   "The service I received at Tuptim Thai was excellent! Since this was my first time here, I ordered the basics: Pad Thai, Tom Kah Guy soup, soft and crispy spring rolls. The crispy spring rolls are out of this world! Honestly, the best I've ever eaten! I wasn't thrilled with the peanut sauce or the sweet and sour sauce for the rolls, however, as they were too thin and were lacking in flavor. The Pad Thai and soup were adequate, but nothing to write home about. I will definitely return to try some of their other dishes.\n\nWent back & had the crispy spring rolls, drunken noodles (mild+) & coconut milk (mild+) soup. All VERY tasty! The crispy spring rolls were too tasty to stop for a picture \ud83d\ude2c.",
   "This place is great!! Food is outstanding, and the staff is on point. They're quick to check on you and make sure everything is good. Try the yellow curry, or drunken noodles, you will not be disappointed!!"

   "This place has phenomenal food and great local beer. Their homemade beer cheese is only $3 and comes with delicious seasoned kettle chips. Totally worth it! I had the classic grilled cheese with Gouda and mozzarella plus guacamole and my side was sweet potato chips. I can\u2019t wait to go back and eat again. Highly recommend!",
   "Drawn in by a google search for local restaurants. Totally and pleasantly surprised!\nAmazing grilled cheeses. Better than mommas. And totally unique.",
   "Wonderful staff. Great variety of sandwiches including a good selection of seasonal sandwiches. Vegetarian options as well. large selection of beers and mixed drinks. The environment  was very warm and cozy. Did not see the patio as it was cold.",
   "First visit was great! Went at lunch time and the service was a little slow but the place was packed, both inside and on the patio. The food was great! Great flavor, interesting combos of cheese, breads, sauces, etc. The tomato bisque soup was delish also! Worth visiting if in Topeka and the NOTO area is neat as well.",
   "Went to the Wheel Barrel on a lark while working in Topeka. Real glad I did. Was with two work colleagues and all of our sandwiches were fire! Will make it a point to go back whenever I'm in Topeka. The hot cider was pleasing and warming on a chilly January day. We shared the Everything Soft Pretzel with Craft Beer Queso which was out of this world. The Not yo Mama's BLT was delicious. Grilled with siracha mayo, crispy bacon and soft brie it was amazing."

We got coffee and two huge breakfast for about $20 bucks. The food was great and we ate some of the best biscuits and gravy we\u2019ve ever had! Yum!! We will have to come back to try the pie! It looked delicious as well!!",
   "The food was great and reasonably priced. The service was great. Very friendly waitress.Worth the tip. The food was brought to the table in a timely manner. Nice and quite breakfast with a little country music playing in the background. Relaxing. All around great eating experience.",
   "Good old fashioned diner with affordable menu. Lots of comfort food choices and pies. Our server was helpful and friendly. I will be back for breakfast sometime. This visit it was lunch.",
   "the best cinnamon rolls in Topeka. The quantities of the other breakfast items are huge. The food is always hot and fresh and the servers are very kind and friendly. Love going to Bradley's and will continue to do so.",
   "What a great place. The dining area is small but the wait isn't very long. The food is awesome. They make their own hash browns, buddies, and even pancake mix. Definitely worth a visit."

   "Excellent lunch buffet with a great selection of food. We were greeted by friendly faces. I complimented the lights and the ambience of the restaurant. It was a beautiful place.\n\n One of the hostesses asked if it was our first time. She proceeded to demonstrate a traditional appetizer dish for us. It was very tasty. The service was exceptional. Fresh bread was offered at the table throughout the meal.  It was a great experience.",
   "The place is really clean and never out of any items in their buffet. Ever since i went there the first time, i have never been to any other place whenever i crave some indian delicacy. Being a typical \u2018white\u2019 guy, i still don\u2019t find the food too spicy or too strong. Moreover, customer service is excellent and the lady manager there always greets you with a gracious smile and is very helpful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who want to try something different and don\u2019t want to spend over the top while doing so",
   "Delicious food. Usually Indian restaurants just add cream to get the yummy taste but not this one. Vegetables and spice brings in the authentic flavor.",
   "Delicious Indian food, lots of options and great for vegetarians and omnivores. Buffet is absolutely delicious."

   "White Linen is a completely unexpected jewel in Topeka, central Capital area.\nJust outstanding gourmet master chef prepared meals. First class quality ingredients, first class delicious meals, excellent classy ambient, professional and friendly folks. \nTake your love one's for dinner, for anniversary, for engagement, for birthdays or come up with any excuse for dinner out to White Linen.\nThe special prices of dinner for two at price one is just incredible deal!!\nI started with Cream of Tomato soup - very tasty, delicious with pieces of crab and a small crab cake and medley of cucumber.\nThe main meal was smoked lamb prime amazing taste, beautifully presented, with out of this world wild mushrooms and perfectly done risotto.\nFor desert, flourless chocolate cake accompanied with French pressed coffee, made it a perfect dinner.\nMy business partner had the porkchop, marvelously done.\nIf anything, I would make the flourless chocolate cake a bit less sweet, more dark chocolatey bitter - use less sugar in the recipe.\nPlease see a few pictures of our meals.",
   "We have been in to dine twice and both experiences were exceptional! Love the location, the atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks, and the acoustics (so important). \n\nSeriously, the acoustics...this usually keeps me out of restaurants, but this place is truly comfortable and easy on the senses.\n\nAnd the food is excellent! The first visit, I had scallops, on the second, I had the salmon. Both were perfectly cooked! The food was so good the first time around that we didn\u2019t even check the menu ahead of time for the second visit - we just thoroughly trusted them and we were not disappointed.\n\nSwank. Upscale. But unpretentious. I can\u2019t wait until our next visit!",
   "We chose The White Linen Chef's table for our daughter's 14th birthday. Great experience and even better food.",
   "Absolutely the best restaurant I\u2019ve ever been to. This place will forever hold a special place in our heart. They went above and beyond to make our marriage proposal perfect. The food was amazing and the chef was personable, professional, talented and passionate about making amazing food. The drinks are some of the best we\u2019ve ever had. The chefs table was such a unique experience. I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. We did relocate out of Kansas but can\u2019t wait to fly out for a special trip and dinner once again. \nHonestly give this place a try. Reasonable price for the quality of food. If this place was in any other town it would be 5 or 10 times the price.",

   "The food was great but our party had a reservation reserved a week in advance and upon arriving they couldnt find our reservation in their system and we ended up having to pull up the email of the reservation confirmation for them to believe us. We ended up having to wait 35 minutes before they decided to pull a few tables together for us to be able to sit down. The waitresses were great considering how busy it was. The restaurant kind of has an older folks type of vibe to me",

Perfection.  The fillet salad was served with blue cheese really good.  Fast service friendly wait staff even though I came in 40 minutes before close.  The hot rolls are very good would recommend  snagging a few.  I know it is a chain but not all places are equal.   The restrooms are very clean.  Would recommend.",
   "Always a great place to go!! Reasonable prices, clean restaurant & bathrooms and for being a busy evening, we waited only 5 minutes. Food was excellent as were the mixed drinks. We had such a nice waitress (Twila) & she took great care of me and my husband. The evening was great!",
   "Ordered my steak medium rare & got it burnt on the outside, it was hard, crunchy & tough. First time I had been there in 3 years and now I will never go back. A STEAKHOUSE should know how to properly cook a steak. Husbands hamburger was also hard as heck on the outside. Service was great tho!"

   "My family and I went to The Pennant for a nice family outing. I found the restaurant excellent as did my wife and son. I had the Boy Blue burger and it was by far the best blue cheese burger I\u2019ve ever had. We never get desert but decided to try the Over The Rainbow shake just because we don\u2019t go out like that very often and not only was it big enough to feed a crowd it also tasted amazing. They have an arcade with select classics and some awesome pinball. The place feels like a mom and pop Dave and Busters but with better food and focus more on nostalgia with the arcade. It\u2019s fun to rediscover some classics with the family. The customer service is what takes this place from great to extraordinary. We went to get the cards to play and the machine was down upstairs so we went downstairs to get them and were informed it\u2019s be 15 min or so before we could get cards for the games. We decided to walk dinner off downtown and walked to our car to put our leftovers away. We got back and instead of buying cards the manager handed each of us a loaded card compliments off management for the inconvenience. I was astonished at how well we were taken care of without expecting it at all. We were still willing to pay and he would t hear of it. Keep up the great work y\u2019all! We  ant really enjoy the games but we will be happy to order take out during this tough time. We will also love to visit once this dilemma has passed.",
   "Where to begin, this place was so fun. The restaurant was delicious, the Mac and cheese bites were very fun to try and tasted delicious. The milkshakes came in so many fun flavors! I got the rainbow one, it had an ice-cream cone with ice-cream inside the milkshake!\n\nThe arcade was a blast too! About 8 pin ball games, ski ball, and a lot of really cool games to try. They had pac-man, track and field, and so many more!  The games are not free, although a game card is absolutely worth the cost. For $20 I got 100 game credits and each game cost roughly around 2-3 credits. \n\nMy one complaint was the bar. There were a lot of loud, shouting people who had been drinking. Although I understand it is a bar.\n\nI would definitely recommend bringing your friends, teens and adults.",
   "Heard a lot of good things about the Pennant Restaurant in downtown Topeka so I wanted to give it a try for lunch.\n\nWent there with my Brother in Law. Sat at the upstairs bar. Will say the bartender had no emotion and didn't look or act like she wanted to be there. My Brother in Law got a beer I got tea. The guy sitting beside me ordered a Bud Light and the bartender brought him a Bud heavy. \n\nI ordered the fish and chips my Brother in Law ordered a strawberry salad with grilled chicken on it. The fish and chips came out with a huge batch of fries that were tasty and 4 small pieces of fish that was plenty. The fish had a decent flavor the fries were good. The strawberry salad was said to be good but the chicken was so dry he couldn't eat it. \n\nAll and all it looks like a cool place with arcade games upstairs. It was somewhat busy for lunch so some people must of got good food there or it was convenient for them to eat there. Probably won't go back.",
   "Really enjoyed this place. First time in and it was kinda crowded for a Tuesday night. Nevertheless we were seated right away. Service was excellent and the food was very tasty. Highly recommend the Thai cauliflower. A spicy delight. I had the Nashville Chicken sandwich and it was deliciously juicy and flavorful. The topping choices for the fries were really fun. Creamy jalepeno was very good. Surprised it took us this long to check this place out. Next time we'll enjoy the arcade.:)",
   "It was an okay experience. The company I was with made it better.\n\nService was slow. Our waitress already had a long day and definitely was not up to taking care of anyone. I feel for her. Perhaps staffing was not good that day either. \n\nIt was my first time there. I loved the alcohol shakes but the atmosphere left something to be desired.\n\nMaybe next time we are in town things will be different but for now it's meh outing. For service and atmosphere."

I had a hard time deciding between two different entrees, and the waiter recommended the buffalo chicken wrap, and I was not disappointed at all! So good! Just enough spice, the chicken was tasty and crispy, and it was just all around excellent! Atmosphere is nice and upscale, but not over the top. I would confidently recommend the Blue Moose to anyone looking for a great meal!",

I found it would be good to get there before 11:30 for lunch - go and ask them why! My tomato sauce was cooked down a little too much Very thick, but very tasty. Of course I will return.  So will you!",
   "The atmosphere was perfect. Frank Sinatra played on the speakers as we walked in. I was finally here. My first time at the location in Topeka, I had them years before but in Lawrence and my taste buds were not as they are now. We were seated within minutes. There were a couple of people in the restaurant, not too cluttered, restaurant kind of small, but gives it a cozy feel, the lighting was great, we were seated at a table, within two minutes our waiter was spot on with asking what we wanted to drink. I got Pepsi he got Mountain Dew, then he asked what we wanted to order not skipping a beat, the gentleman really was a pro, I ordered the amazing Garlic Cheese Bread and the Chicken Parmaigiana\n$14.99, and my friend ordered the Roman Twins,  the plates were massive. I couldn't even finish mine.. And I m still so stuffed I can barely think to write this review... All in all.. Everything was perfect, except the sauce I felt was a little sweet... Only reason for the 4 and not 5 stars... One of my best Labor Day memories though...thanks Paisano's for making me feel right at home.... You did a great job",
   "Let me first say that I have been a fan of Paisano's for years, which is why it pains me to write this review. My husband and I took our son here as a treat before my upcoming deployment, and we both feel that the service and quality of food has diminished. Service was incredibly slow and our waitress seemed overwhelmed with her three tables. My pasta sauce was listed as a garlic and olive oil sauce with balsamic vinegar and there was no balsamic, nothing but oil (see picture). Sonsad to see a place we love lose quality."

Bartender was friendly and had clearly been doing it for a while as she knew what she was doing and her guests knew her.",
   "Served 2 well done steaks in a row, I ordered med rare. No manager talked to me, never fixed the problem. Just comped it and left me with cold fries and apple sauce for dinner, pretended like I didn't ever order a steak for dinner. Great bar service though minus the second steak sitting in front of me the entire time, and no correction ever replaced it. Poor expo, grill cook, and manager performance. Very very poor :/",
   "This has always been my favorite place bit I tried the ribs for the first time and they were dry as dust.  Taste was great but too dry.  Everything else was fantastic",
   "Wanted to help a business in a difficult time. I was very disappointed. I did the online order with curbside pick up for a family of 6. When we got our food home we were missing 1 whole meal, the side for another, and the 3 chicken fried steaks were all chicken fried chicken. Come on guys you really need to up your game. Was looking to have a nice sit down with the family but instead will be in the car for the next hour and was just told the chicken fried steaks were sold out. You have my phone number you could have saved us both some time.",
   "I called 1 hour before we got there to be added to the phone que. When we arrived we only waited 5 min for our table. The food was exceptional, and the service was beyond. The atmosphere was like a dream, and the experience was the best I've had in years. Thank you for everything!!!"

   "The Globe was even better than I had remembered!! Got take out and it was so delicious and got so much food!! The staff were very awesome too; they were so friendly, hardworking, and helpful. If you love Indian food like I do then come give them a visit, you won't be disappointed \ud83d\ude42!!",
   "The whole fish was outstanding. Very nice service and delicious accompaniments. Will go again when I'm Topeka. Nice glass fixtures that appear to be blown.",
   "Visited Globe's lunch buffet again.  I have eaten lunch there for over 20 years, frequently back when I worked within walking distance and still as often as I can.  I have never visited for dinner though.  They always have a nice selection for lunch. The quality of the food is excellent and they cook it as it should be with lots of spice!  If you love Indian cuisine, treat yourself!  I highly recommend Globe.  The only drawback is, which is on me, is I always eat too much trying to try a bit of everything!",
   "We ordered out somewhere new to us tonight and were absolutely NOT disappointed. We ordered Tandoori Shrimp, and Shrimp Biryani. Masala Chai Tea for the drink. It was ALL fantastically amazing. We will absolutely be going back. Thank You Globe for the amazing food!",
   "It is not for me.I won't be back there to eat but the people who work there are so nice, they get 5 stars! They make me want to come in just to visit with them. They are very friendly, funny, welcoming, outgoing, and they interact with their customers. I'm glad I went,even if I didn't have any lunch. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

   "A jewel! If you prefer upscale dining with a cozy atmosphere without upmarket prices make Chez Yasu your restaurant of choice. Everyone says to order the butternut squash soup. The best! Goat cheese salad was laid perfectly and the shrimp with a nice tangy butter sauce were paired nicely. I will be back to sample more from a Chef who has talent.",

A bit crunchy at the edges. The fries were fresh and they gave me quite a bit of them. Only a little over $5, so not bad on pricing. I'll probably be back again some time. Quality food at a good price.",

   "Just what you would expect from a classic diner. A cheeseburger that reminds you that some food is meant to be enjoyed. The onion rings were perfect, and the chocolate shake was thick and creamy. And prices that should make fast food chains ashamed. Well done BoBo's... That's how you become a classic."

   "How was HuHot Mongolian Grill? Wonderful! It was really wonderful. My wife and I stopped by on a whim as we were traveling through, we were so glad we did.  The food was amazing.  Prices were great. Service wonderful (although maybe slightly under staffed). The manager was one of the best restaurant managers I have seen, and it is reflected in all other parts of this HuHot location.  We'll be making it a point to travel through here more often just so we can enjoy some more HuHot!",
   "It has been about 10 years since I have been to a HuHot Mongolian Grill. I found the Topeka one to be clean, friendly, and quick to serve. I was a little discouraged with the diluted nature of the garlic oils in the sauces. I felt I placed a significant amount of \u201csauces\u201d on the entree but after it was cooked, to the food was rather bland. I was looking for a strong garlic flavor with 9-10 ladles of Garlic oil.\nThe selection was fantastic on the bars from the meats to the veggies to the final toppings. Our server was amazing, always smiling and came to the table at just the right timing. The grill master was a blast and engaged the customers which I feel gives it a personal touch. Finally if you are practicing any of the various eating lifestyles, this HuHot caters to many of them i.e. Keto, Atkins, Weight watchers, etc. I would definitely recommend this place just make sure you really \u201cload up\u201d on the oils/sauces.",
   "Great food cooked on a grill right in front of you. You pick your own meats and veggies in a bowl and add sauces. Then take it to the grill. Tastes gr8!",
   "Fresh ingredients, fresh veggies, fresh oils and sauces to try. It is also vegetarian friendly or for those trying to stay on a keto diet. \nI always get great service here and leave happy and full.",
   "I had never been to a HuHot before. I LOVED it!!! Can't wait to go back!"

They have the best pork fritter in a 100 mile radius.  A definite MUST DO if you don't get here very often!",

The cheese had just the right amount of stretch, the pepperonis were nice and crisp, and the crust was perfect. It even had just the right amount of sauce, which was flavorful and not too sweet. The decor on the inside of the restaurant was cute, reminiscent of NYC. We stopped on a whim and left knowing we'd be back!",

A great place to hang out or have large group get togethers in the party room. Food is delicious and always hot and fresh out the oven. The bartenders are amazing and can always recommend good drinks. Servers always check up on us even though you order the food at the bar. There are also great drink specials every night of the week."

This is exactly the type of place I love about Topeka.",

   "Stopped in during Restaurant Week. Mmmm..I would characterize it as upscale casual. A bit noisy. I was dining alone so  didn't have to worry about conversation. You can wear jeans, which I did , like the wait staff or be a bit dressed up. The number of wait staff was confusing at first. Then it was just two primary ones. Overall, the service is good and you should tip accordingly for that. Maybe not so much for the food. The food was cooked to perfection except my main course salmon was waaayyy over seasoned. It was paired with an equally salty side. Main course was kinda like a salt lick. Next time I will request light to no salt and hope for the best. I didn't send back, but was tempted to. Real butter with the hot yeast roll. Noticed I said roll. The meal combinations are interesting. All the courses are just enough for one person.  Which is fine, no leftovers to hang out in my fridge for days. I would give suggest giving them a try. Be prepared for a wee bit of a sticker shock for the quality of the food. It is nice to have a more upscale option to consider.",

The chef was great and was pretty funny. The show was pretty short and simple but was still cool nonetheless. My only complaint would be the grills and surrounding area was pretty dirty. You could see all the built up grease on the front of the grill. I also saw a lot of old food in the crevices on top of the grill. All in all, the food was good and the service was timely. I would definitely go back again.",

I recommend the BBQ Smokehouse pizza made with smoked brisket, pulled pork and polish sausages from Hermann's Meat Market. They've also got an awesome beer list, so it's a good place to have a cold one and watch the game as well.",

A few minutes after we sat down and older lady rushed over to us, very rudely tossed our menus down and immediately asked what we wanted. We told her we had never been there before and we would need sometime, she didn't say anything.. just walked off. About 10 minutes later a younger gal came over and took over our table, the rest  of our service was good. The food was great,  but due to the service, we won't be back.",
   "Went here for the first time last Monday, January 20th, 2020, but we will never ever come back. We ordered Deluxe pizza for carry out, got there, took my order. When I got into the car my wife asked me to check our order. We were 100% sure that we got a cheese-flavored pizza. Went back in and told the wait staff about it and this is what she said: \"we put cheese in between our stuffing and I'm sure that is not cheese pizza\". When we got home, true enough, it was only cheese flavor!!! We were so livid. We spent $20 only for a cheese-flavored pizza. What a ripped off!",
   "Amazing food and the wait staff was equally amazing. I recommend LaRocca's for their bread alone. I had the Pasta Your Way as Spaghetti with Vodka Sauce and Chicken which was great."

We will return!!!  \nSaw the change in hours and wanted to share with ya'll.  One man band shop with kids....  I understand the urgency of changing hours.  Let's ralley behind the owner and show him how much we like what he has to offer!!",
   "This place use to be amazing! Best in town.\nTakes for ever to get your food anymore!\nThe newest thing they have changed the hours again!\nWith a sign in the window of Temporary Hours\nlooks like they are only open for dinner on Friday and Saturday\u2019s.\nI called for 20 minutes before driving 17 minutes to get here to find a note in the window. CLOSED\nThey should AT Least have an answering machine that says they are CLOSED! \nSince sitting here writing this, 3 more customers have pulled up to find they are closed!!",
   "This place has weird hours. Just because it says they are open at X time doesn't mean they actually are. Also sometimes the front desk lady is baby sitting as well as working.. which is odd. However, the food is great here. I have never had a bad experience with the food, and a personal recommendation from me would be the steak and fried rice, super tasty!",
   "Great Price, Better Food.  Get the dishes as hot as you would like.  Everything we have had so far has been awesome.  We've gone twice within three days, should say how amazing their food is.  The customer service is amazing.  The place is well lit and clean.  There sweet and sour soup is probably the best in the state.  "

The chicken was the least smokey but had a good (lemony) flavor. If you like \"funeral potatoes\" you will love their cheesy taters. The smoked mac n' cheese was really good as well. Looking forward to a chance to go back.",
   "We stopped here on our way through town. Based on recommendations, we got the pulled pork nachos. They were very good. They come with just chips, cheese and pork. Then you can add additional items from a bar.  Made them even better in my opinion that you get to pick how to dress them. We also got the sampler. The best part of the whole thing was the smoked chicken wings. The sausage and brisket were also good.  We ordered sides- cheesy potatoes, smoked mac and cheese, smoked corn and the baked beans. All were solid. My favorite was the potatoes. Good beer selection, friendly service and nice decor make it worth the trip. ",
   "The restaurant is well appointed and the menu is simple but perfect. I had the brisket and it was very flavorful and juicy and just fell apart. We also had the pulled pork nachos, which was fun and stupid good. The people were very nice and helpful.",

I stop through there about once a month to get a bag of bagels, with two sides of cream cheese, to take to my office and share. My wife stops there a couple of mornings during the week to grab a bagel for us to share. She will get a chai tea and get me coffee. She did have a bad experience yesterday. It was not with staff. Or the ordering experience. It was with the quality of the bagel and the amount of cream cheese on it. This was the first time we had a problem. I hope it is not an indicator of what is to come."

I'm applaud your business and even more your caring staff. I hope to sit inside again someday soon.",

Like a few others have commented, the pizza sauce lacked all flavor. Usually a bump of salt or Parmesan cheese will help, but I did both and nothing helped. Toppings were fair, but for the \"higher cost\" pizza experience I'm apt to go back to my other favorite place.",
   "This pizza was pretty close to the \u201creal\u201d New York pizza. Let me also say the pizza was HUGE and enough to feed an army. The meat lovers was phenomenal and the seasoning was very good. Only complaint I have is the way the pizza was cut...it bugged my OCD big time. Some large pieces, some smaller ones, way uneven. Other than that, five stars."

You can build your own I always add the white lime flavored rice pinto beans to mine. Also the medium sauce is on point also known as Verde sauce. The portions are very filling. Their food is fresh and alive with flavor. One of my favorite places to eat for sure.",

I really appreciate the great service and amazing food this Qdoba has provided our city with! Thank you so much!!!",

We left will probably not return. Ball or rag hit in food. Manager needs to address this kind of behaviour. Good luck with your food purchases there",
   "The staff is wonderful. It has been over a year since I moved out of town, but while visiting, I dropped by and was recognized and asked how I'd been. I love the nachos made with all the different ingredients I select."

The staff was very polite and the service was exceptionally quick from getting drinks to being served our entrees.  The food was good but I wouldn't say it was anything unique.  Maybe getting to explore beyond the lunch menu would be helpful.",

   "My wife and I  decided to try El Chilar tonight and we were not disappointed.\nWe were greeted  by the owner and he has to rank in the top ten of the nicest guys to run a restaurant and we were quickly seated and brought menus. He asked if this was our first time in and answered our questions about the menu and before we knew it we had fresh chips and Salsa with drinks. He explained the hot and mild salsa and he was visibly pleased by our favorable reactions because both had excellent flavor and the hot (IMO) had just the right amount of heat. There were several items on the menu that I wanted and I was surprised to see that they offered Chili Colorado because not a lot of places offer it. I decided to have the Chili Verde and the wife had the pan fried taco dinner and both were served with beans and rice. Our meals were timed very well and we had just finished our chips and both plates had excellent presentation and the food was hot and very well prepared. The pork in the Chili Verde was perfect and the flavoring was excellent and my wife said that her chicken taco's were excellent also with great flavor and very well prepared.\nBusiness was slow tonight and the owner said that with the snow his business had been slower but this is also a sign to me and when business is slow in a small restaurant and the food is perfectly prepared and has excellent taste this says a lot about the establishment.\nMy wife and I highly recommend El Chilar and I will have to try the Chili Colorado the next time we are in.",
   "Wonderful food! Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food was great. Husband and wife own/operate it. My Chili Verde burrito was incredible.",
   "They were a bit short staffed there the cook just had a baby. The fajitas were decent and the taco was ok fell apart though. The enchilada sauce tasted like canned tomato. Knowing it wasn't  the normal chef I'll give it another shot after the normal chef comes back. Will update star rating and review when I do. \n\nSide note: Owner was nice. He comped the nachos because they forgot to put the meat on them.",
   "This place is awesome.  I had heard good things about it but this was our first experience.  The food and the service we're incredible.  The owners are really great people.  Everyone should give it a try!!!!!!",
   "Very tasty little Mexican diner with authentic dishes.  The entire menu isnt all listed, so bring your smart phone to see the other items.  Very accommodating and excellent service"

White rice was hot, sticky and fresh.  The decor is nice, but with oddly out of place plastic on tables.  Overall I would recommend.",
   "Food is a little pricey for what you get. Ordered Hunan beef and hot and sour soup. Both had a good flavor to them. But not much in the way of contents. Ive never had cabbage used as a replacement for vegetables as much as this place does.",
   "Flavors were excellent but portions were a bit small for the price.",
   "I ordered sweet n sour Chicken. It was awful!! Dried up fatty chicken with absolutely No vegetables. I called and asked if they forgot the veg and Matt said no, it doesn't come with vegetables.  The rice was greasy and only had dried up but greasy corn. Please save your money. It is the worse Chinese food I've ever had in my life."

   "What a great lunch today - so glad to be in Topeka and have something open. The food was great - 2 meat deal with beans - black coffee. My waitress was so happy to be working and made lunch fun. Mike Kagay recommends the \"engineer\" so next time I will try that. Thanks for great service and food.",
   "Once you first step in the atmosphere is what really pops out. I would give 5 stars for the atmosphere.  Hard wood floors great lighting plenty of space between you and the next table.  They even have a room that can accommodate 48 people for private parties. I had the Saison and Kolsch both I would recommend to anyone that does not like a high IBU beer.  My wife had the club and said it was good.  Better than going to subway but not as good as some of the specialty shops.  I had the top city cheese steak, it had great flavor but was soo dry it was hard to eat without sauce. I had their greens and would recommend them over most places in Kansas. They were not overcooked and had a nice flavor. The fried pickles where some of the best I have head.  Crispy outside with a  mellow flavor compared to most I have had.  For the whole family they would not be too spicy for any age.    We will try it again to see if the food is different during peak hours vs mid day. Wait staff was very cordial and could help recommend the perfect food and drink experience for you.",
   "Food was delicious.  Small restaurant in downtown Topeka.  I highly recommend downloading Yelp, they use it for waiting for your table.  There was a large party and our waitress seemed a bit tired up with them frequently.  We had to ask for lemons and other items several times.  Our check was even delivered by another waitress, eventually picked up by our waitress.  The very redeeming qualities was the food, far better than expected.  We do plan to return, we will not have the same waitress.",
   "Big, open, industrial feel. The food was amazing. It took a little longer to get but they were pretty busy when we went. Wait staff was super friendly.",
   "It was a nice place for dinner. The pulled pork ( what I had) was tender and had a good flavor, the drawback was it was quite dry. It is a good thing I like a lot of BBQ sauce. My wife had a salad and said it was good with no drawbacks. As a more bar focused theme this wasn't such a big deal but it was also loud from people talking. They had nothing to soften the sounds. This was our first trip and we do intend to give it another try. Overall the staff was nice, the food did not take too long, but we didn't order anything they had to make on the spot. The prices were par for what you got. I did get the feeling our waitress was a bit busier then the other staff just standing around the bar talking it up. I would like to give 4.5 stars but gave the benefit of the doubt."

I\u2019m a big fan of two things that usually aren\u2019t found: mole and albondigas.  I didn\u2019t get to try the mole yet, but this big delicious bowl of albondigas was top notch.  It\u2019s a simple meatball soup with carrots and squash, but it\u2019s so delicious.  It\u2019s exactly how family would make it (except they usually put big chunks of potato in it).\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be doing back.

   "Taco El Sol has been a weekly stop for us for years.  However, the last few visits the place, never spotless, has been grimy.  There is no attempt to wash the tables between customers and no attempt to keep the floor somewhat presentable during the day.  Our last visit there were few customers but every table was dirty.  Customers usually bus the tables themselves so all they need to do is come out and wash the tables.  The food is still good, but hard to enjoy in these surroundings.   My husband has ceased to order the steak burrito, because it has turned into a bean and steak burrito.  Half of his last steak burrito was all beans.  Something has changed this past year."

My only complaints are that I wish the portions were a little bigger and that they are a little expensive, for what you get, but darn good! Give 'em a try! Oh, and for something different, try the fried cheesecake. Mmmm me likey!",
   "Never been here before. Went and had pan fried tacos\u2014 amazing. The service was THE BEST Jorge was our waiter and his smile and fun attitude made for a great dinner with friends. Will be going back for sure!",
   "Best Mexican Food in Topeka, KS \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc PERIOD! The food is so fresh. Jorge\u2019s cheese dip has so much flavor! The chips and salsa are fire \ud83d\udd25! I tried the Gringo Quesadilla, I would highly recommend. Clean environment, cold margaritas, and friendly staff. Anytime I want Mexican food in Topeka, Margarita Jalisco (NORTH) will receive my business every time. Only restaurant that reminds me of home, California! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
   "One of the best Mexican place I have been to. Great food, very good portion, and I inexpensive price. Their michelada was great. Even though the one come with shrimp cost $13, it still worth all the money. Great atmosphere, great food, great service, all around I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.",
   "Love Taco Tuesday. Its hit and miss on the service sometimes. The chicken tacos are delicious and for $.99, amazing!"

   "One of the few local restaurants on Happy Cow in Topeka offering vegan food. We made the drive over to an empty-artsy area of town. Food was alright. We got the V burrito, the only vegan item on the menu. The sweet salsa they offer tasted like a strawberry smoothie and was a bit weird.",
   "Great place, comfy/accepting environment with great burrito choice (the cilantro lime rice is the best!)\n\nFood comes up fairly quick and I haven't had anything I didn't like \ud83d\ude01",
   "Love it, the decor it unique, fitting well into the NOTO atmosphere\ud83c\udf86. Food was good, enjoyed the fact that I could have a beer with my lunch.\n\nDivine timing, while we were in NOTO Burrito, WIBW was filming a segment of 'Fork in the Road'. it will air 3/10/20 @ 5pm",
   "Very tasty food and great portions, especially for the price. The workers were really friendly and the food was served very quickly.",
   "BEST burritos I've ever had. This is my official burrito spot. Great service. Great food"

   "This is my go to place whether it's lunch time or 4 am after a night of fun. It is open 24/7 and it is consistently great food. Staff is quite patient and always in a good mood. I highly recommend their burrito line up and pickled carrots.",
   "Service was great! And food came pretty quickly. Very good tasting food. A must try for sure \ud83d\ude04",
   "I love this place and eat there at least once a week. My favorite is the chorizo breakfast burrito, so good! Love the nachos with steak too! Prices are good for me though I know some folks might think they are a bit high but you get what you pay for and for the price Panchos is fresh and tasty! \u2764\ufe0f",
   "Excellent food!  Best in Topeka!  We couldn't decide what to order.  It took us forever but the staff was patient.  She described each thing we asked about on the menu until we were satisfied w/our choice.  We were very pleased w/the food. We've been back several times. I dream about their food! You get tons of food also.  More than enough for one meal!",
   "Absolutely Loved the Carna Asada Taco's!!! Definitely worth checking out for dinner... will definitely be back if I am in the neighborhood again!!!"
