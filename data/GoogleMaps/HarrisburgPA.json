   "Not as 'wild' as the name leads to think but a great time for all ages, mostly hardened trail and seemingly stroller accessible (although not attempted myself). The visitor center is great and informative with plenty to read about the history of the park and the items you wondered about whilst hiking. I'd recommend to keep the visitor center for last.",
   "Great for walks and strollers. There is always wildlife to observe. You can go and have a different experience each time. From the trail you take to the people you run into do the life that you see. There is also some pretty cool natural art.",
   "Great place to enjoy the woods, scene and FRESH AIR for our LUNGS. Lets give the future(young people) a great world to live in. Support your local parks and stop the Gutting and Dismantling of the EPA.  \"Mother Nature\" gives us love and life, lets love her back and PROTECT HER PEOPLE!!!",
   "This place is amazing for nature. They have a small coloring room for kids. Provide binoculars for the view outside! In case of bad weatherthe inside has a lot to see, in the outside has. I went on a job field trip, but it's definitely family fun!",
   "Our family loves Wildwood park. It's a nice place to take a walk or teach a child to ride a bike. The nature center is amazing for kids, lots of hands on activities."

   "Beautiful museum! We spent only a few hours here, but you could easily spend the entire day looking at everything. It will take you back in time. The curators did a great job with the layout, some of it is a bit redundant, but all worth seeing. We went on a Monday when they first opened, it wasn't busy which made the experience more reflective, as you're not trying to hover or read around a crowd, also it was very very quiet and peaceful, which I imagine it would not be on a busy day or if they had a field trip of kids.",
   "They got big guns, they got little guns, they have roughly medium sized guns that are not quite as big as the big guns. It is also important to note that the roughly medium sized guns are not quite as little as the little guns. If the little guns are a 2 and the big guns are a 18, the roughly medium sized guns would be a 9. If you like guns, you might lile this place, no promises.",
   "This is a very nice museum. There are so many interesting artifacts that I was very impressed to see. It is very nicely laid out and you could certainly spend a few hours here learning more about our Nation's history.",
   "Good Learning Experience\n\nI enjoyed my tour of the museum! It was very informative with actual Pre and Post Civil War artifacts! Being a Southern Black American, and seeing the real chains and clothing worn by slaves that could have been my ancestors was a very moving experience. I would have liked to see more exhibits about the contribution made my slaves to the winning of the war.",
   "This is a top notch museum. Not crowded on march 12. We walked through it in about 3 hours."

Guided tours run every half hour.  The building, artwork and furnishings are impressive and in excellent condition.  Especially check out the artwork in the Moravian tile floor.",

   "This is the best and pretty good place to come after work to grab some pizza and drinks. I definitely coming back here again. Best of all the best!",
   "I was very impressed by the architect and artwork that went into this Capitol building. It's a good place to meet with your state representatives and to have Rally's to push important bills through. Wonderful offices to  work in, very secure, handicap accessible to all complete with a cafeteria although I would consider the food that was served to be substandard and a better quality needed for our state representatives. I must stop in if you're in the area Harrisburg Pennsylvania",
   "Here's the mega troubling on routes of 119 and 30 interchange is problem on lots of traffic jam on the holidays and some evenings and now coming soon new business is unconstruction now and will be open for summer, it's will be biggest trouble in the traffic jam on location and area!! Here's some succestion for the location now first remove which business now is the time for road work and adding the new road ramps to route 30 interchange now and that's good idea right now!!"

   "Beyond expectations. What a great place to spend a couple of hours, meandering through ancient and recent history.\nEverything is covered from dinosaurs to the development of the Penna Turnpike! My 7 year old was captivated throughout the exhibits and really liked the civil war spread.\n\nRecommended!",
   "Went here, and enjoyed every moment. The vastness and variety of the historical pieces here really made me like this place.",
   "Great history and nice place",
   "I love taking my daughters here because there is so much for them to do in the toddler area right in the front of the museum. We haven\u2019t made it out of there except once and my oldest kept asking to go back! It is for kiddos up to 5 and there is so much to do! They have large farm animals including a GIANT baby chick, building blocks, apples that can be \u201cpicked\u201d from the trees and carrots and cabbage that can be \u201charvested.\u201d There is also several costumes for the kids to dress us, tons of books, lots of stuffed animals, a play bedroom with a small kitchen and tunnels, a play bus with a small slide, and they also have toys that they routinely swap out so there is always something different. \n\nOne of my favorite things is there is a bathroom right inside with a kid sized toilet that is perfect for potty training toddles. They do not allow food or drinks inside and are open starting at 10 am.  Another great thing is that it is free for AD military and dependents so that is not only appreciated but also a plus! The perfect hot or rainy day activity.\n\nI\u2019m sure we will be back many times!",
   "We enjoyed Charter Day (free admission!)! It was nice to explore our states history and see the actual charter from the King of England to William Penn allowing him to establish a colony here. The only complaint was the show in the planetarium. It was nothing but a giant ad for NASA and their cries for more funding. But for free...it was something to do."

   "Very awesome displays, perfect place for any fire department enthusiast or current/past members of the fire service. Members of the museum are themselves retired fire service members and very knowledgeable.",
   "What a wonderful experience! I took my 17yr old son and his 12yr old stepbrother on a Saturday morning - it was not very crowded at all. The staff was polite, well-informed, helpful and attentive.\nOriginally the Reily Hose Co. No. 10, a Victorian Firehouse built in 1899, this museum exceeded my expectations. The website doesn't do it justice!\nThe lower level houses apparatus, firefighting equipment and the gift shop. The upper level has the historic Gamewell Alarm System - a fantastic, interactive display from the 1920s - as well as an exquisite collection of firefighting memorabilia. Don't miss the beautiful memorial wall, and remember to visit the gift shop - prices are super reasonable!",
   "Absolutely loved the museum. Lots to look at and learn. They were even nice enough to allow my toddler to sit on the engines. Highly recommend for the fire fighter lover in all of us."

   "There are essentially four exhibit areas. Very well done. Perfect additional stop if you're headed to Midtown. Take advantage of the free parking in back. I didn't realize it was there until I saw the sign on the front door.",
   "What an amazing place! We are here for the 1st time on a school trip. The morning presentations were divided into to parts for the elementary children (k-2/3-5)& was at a level that was easily understood by them without treating them as if they were unintelligent. My son (7) thoroughly enjoyed the creative actitivty & said he even liked learning about the artist & seeing the other paintings.\nMy daughter (11) attended the afternoon (6-12) presentation & said that it wasn't as boring as she thought it would be. The also did a creative actitivty which she loved and said the presentation on the pictures was very interesting & informative.\nWith the muesum changing exhibits every 12 week there are multiple times each year you could visit & do new things. We enjoyed this trip a lot & plan to become members to enjoy it even more. Some of the perks are AWESOME.",
   "My husband and I visited the museum during the Picasso exhibit, and we had a wonderful time! For starters, we had no problem finding regular meter parking on the same block as the museum which made for a very pleasant beginning to our artsy adventure. The museum and exhibition itself was somewhat on the small side but not disappointing in the least. If anything, it helped to create a more intimate, laidback atmosphere. You did not feel the need to rush through the exhibit. It gave off a relaxed vibe , and allowed for you to spend time truly enjoying and discussing each piece. It was a very nice, and much welcomed change from  the hustle and bustle of the larger museums and/or exhibits we have been to. We also were very happy and excited to learn that just a few blocks down from the museum was an absolutely beautiful and wonderful bookstore complete with a delicious coffee bar. From the outside, it was not much to look at, but upon entering, it was indescribable! It was just like the old bookstores you always see on movies. It was the perfect ending to a relaxing and inspirational day! I highly recommend anyone who is a fan of art check out Susquehanna Art Museum via Facebook for more information and their upcoming events!",
   "Small but current collections are diverse and engaging. Kid friendly, inexpensive, and only a couple of blocks from the market.  Would definitely do again.",
   "Very unique place with lots of different mediums used in displays. The staff is very friendly. You don't want to miss going through this museum."

   "This past Sunday was the first time we visited the Governor's Residence.  On a special occasion of course --  the Annual Holiday Open House!  You see, normally the GR is only open for tours during the months of April, May, June, September, and October between the hours of 9:30 am and 2:00 pm.  I don't think anyone would take a day off from work just to go on the tour, do you?  So this was a golden opportunity that we didn't want to miss.\n\nNow it was for the Christmas holidays so it was even more the reason to visit. There were a total of 8 Christmas trees inside the GR!  Garlands and ornaments were everywhere.  Santa Claus was there for picture taking.  The Christmas village and the 3 trains that were running on the tracks -- so fascinating!   There were free hot ciders, hot chocolate, and cookies.  All of the staff were out greeting people and answering questions. Choir was singing Christmas Carols and the pianist was playing funky tunes.  Governor Wolf and his First Lady, Frances were there shaking hands with visitors and posing for photos.  And most of all, the mansion itself was simply amazing, as ornate as a residence can be!\n\nWe were fortunate to be part of this occasion on our first visit. We had such fond memories of the time we spent there.",

We didn't pay to go into the mansion but walked the grounds and took in the river views. There is a little playground, benches, and picnic tables. The mansion is across the street from the barn and covered bridge, which are also cool.  If you are looking for something free to do outside, this  would be great to bring the kids and walk around, enjoy the day, maybe have a picnic. You could even have a fun adult date here.",
   "This was a delightful place for the holidays. They had displays, tours of the mansion, and crafts. Mainly though my little one loved the model railroad display they had for the holidays. Really a good place for nice walk even when it's not the holidays. They do have events throughout the year, so you will want to check their website.",
   "We went to the mansion on Friday because the kids were off school for Columbus Day. Both of my children went to Fort Hunter for their 3rd grade field trips and my daughter has been asking to go back for over a year! Plus my husband has never been. We walked up and rang the bell and a very friendly tour guide answered and we paid for the tour. It was extraordinary! Despite 3 of the 4 of us having toured the mansion before she provided a great deal of new facts. Even my 11 year old son said it felt like a different tour. She spent almost an hour with us and answered all our questions and was extremely knowledgeable. Unfortunately none of us took note of her name. I would love for Fort Hunter to know she is amazing! Thanks for a fun family day!",
   "Great place to learn history. Beautiful wedding venue! Friendly staff. Neat little gift shop. Nice picnic spot. I highly recommend taking the tour of the house.",

   "A nice, clean park with walking trails, shades, seating arrangements, picnic areas, options to grill. There are many areas for children to play. Tennis courts. I always find sports, events going on here at all time. Parking convenient and available at diff places throughout the park. Good place to walk pets too. Love this park.",
   "This was a fantastic park! Very clean, and well kept. Numerous courts to use: tennis, basketball. Picnic tables readily accessible, trash bins near every table. Full bathrooms open for use. We saw many small playgrounds at various places, and one gigantic super fun play area. Big win for the family on our road trip.",
   "Very awesome park. Lots for kids to do, nice walking paths, nature trails (make sure wear sturdy shoes) that go down to the creek. Great place to walk your dog as well.",
   "Nice clean park. There are multiple different sport fields there. You can play tennis and basketball. They have bathrooms and benches. A lot of parking space. There is a children playground. In addition, there are few trails. There is a bench on the river shore. It is a peaceful place",
   "A nicely kept park. Clean with plenty to do. Railroad car to visit, Tennis courts, soccer fields, long walking trails, multiple playgrounds and pavilions with portable toilets during the off  season. Dogs are welcome on leashes. Ample Parking lot, that's long and close to everything. I highly recommend visiting."

   "They had off street parking, and friendly game master. The puzzels themes are fun.\n\nNow for the 3 star rating stuff.\n\nThe room felt a little thrown together and cheap. \n\nIn the room my group did, there was a bonus objective, however there was NOT a puzzle on how to complete it. You just had stumble upon it.",
   "I had a fantastic time here with my family in one of the Titanic rooms. It's a very interactive experience, and it takes a lot of different types of brains to escape. The staff is amazing - they test you on how to use different types of locks before you enter the room so that you know what you're doing once you're in there. And they are watching/listening the entire time, so they can offer clues along the way if you get stuck. The rooms are very claustrophobic-friendly, too. We had a window in our room that we could open, and there's a button next to the door that opens it if you need to step out for a minute or use the bathroom. Very fun experience, I would definitely return!",
   "We liked the shipwreck theme and it was challenging without it being too difficult. The person who explained the rules/room spoke very fast and made us feel rushed. The one lock was very difficult to open- we had the correct code and tried it multiple times without it opening. They should have locks that work for an escape room.",
   "Four of us did one of the smaller rooms. We had a blast. We talked with one of the owners for a bit, he is a bit, he was really nice. We look forward to going back and doing the other room some time.",
   "We started here with a group of 10 people for my wife's birthday party. Let's just say we had a blast. Unfortunately, we did not make it out in time but we had such a good time. We want to say thank you for helping us celebrate a wonderful day with all of our friends. We highly recommend them!!!"

The wider area of the bridge is metal and it has small holes where you can see through to the water. Definitely not paws friendly and not for those with fear of height. It has a great view and f the river on either side.",

   "I found the Five Senses Gardens while researching for a visit to Harrisburg on Google Maps.  Thank you Google Maps, I would be lost in the world without you.  I visited the gardens for the first time on Sunday October 21 2018.  Unfortunately the weather wasn\u2019t the best but it was partly sunny and I had a wonderful time exploring with my cameras.  I was impressed that the crossing from the parking lot to the park and trail is being upgraded.  I posted pictures of this.  There is an island in the middle of the street for people crossing to the park.  It looks like the crossing will have a flashing light.  It will be fun to see the improvements when I visit next year.  The park could be used as a rest stop for travelers on the Greenbelt.  Unfortunately there are no facilities in the park.   The sound of Spring Creek stimulated the hearing sense which is very relaxing.  There are no picnic tables but there are a few benches for you to sit and enjoy.  I would love to come back and visit in the spring.  I\u2019m sure it would be more colorful then.   The park is easy to find right along South 28th Street (Route 441).",

There's also batting cages, miniature golf, a train, volleyball courts, playground, and concession stands. The Pride of the Susquehanna boat is worth checking out for a quick boat ride or dinner cruise. One of my favorite things is walking the Walnut Street Bridge, a steel truss bridge closed to cars. It connects to Riverfront Park in Harrisburg.",

   "Not sure why a bridge gets a rating but I'll give it 5 stars. This bridge is a BEAST! In the 90's the walnut street bridge collapsed and floated into it. Market street bridge held it's ground! It is also the only driving bridge onto city island.",

   "A wonderful park to bring children of all ages and abilities. There is both an accessible playground for bigger kids as well as one for the younger kiddos.  From tunnels, to slides and balance beams as well as swings, there really is everything! There is even a rock wall. here is also a sandbox.\n\nIn addition to the playgrounds, there is a paved walking path that goes around a large grassy field. There are two pavilions with picnic tables and one of them also houses some outdoor exercise equipment. \n\nIn addition to all of this, there is grass volleyball courts, soccer fields, and plenty of space for just about anything. \n\nYou can rent the pavilions for your outdoor gatherings such as birthday parties, etc. there is a pretty well-maintained bathroom facility as well. In at least the women\u2019s, there is a changing table provided. They are closed during the winter months so keep that in mind. There are drinking fountains on the outside of this building as well but they are also shut off during winter months. \n\nOverall, a wonderful, ENCLOSED park for kiddos to burn off some energy. Even on a wet day, the playground is pretty dry because of the rubber flooring.",
   "Nice and free park for kids. Playground is fenced.  Nice running track around the compound. Bathroom close at sunset. You can  even have parties (I believe you need permission from the church). Good Place \ud83d\ude0a",
   "Great park! There's a lot of tiny humans playing so my own tiny human made a lot of friends! People were so nice they lend my tiny human their ball and we end up playing ball kick. lol there's also pavilions for grilling or just for eating food etc. Overall, great experience and great place!",
   "This is attached to a church and offers a neat outdoor fitness area.  There is a huge area for the kids to play in and a pretty long running track.  This area would be great for a picnic on a sunny day and there are plenty of benches along the trail.  Parking is plentiful and there is no cost to visit.  While I was there they had a 5K race going on, but I was still able to enjoy the area.",
   "This is a great place to take your child if they love to climb steps.   There are plenty of different heights to maneuver across and the majority of high places have a tall sturdy railing to prevent falling.  There is tons of parking and it's separate from the vast play area.   Nice amount of swings, monkey bars and activities to tire out the little ones on."

   "Not as colorful as Crystal Caves but much larger. Great guide service and friendly staff. Be prepared to hike a lot but worth the effort.",
   "This place was amazing! Not crowded, and the temperature in the cave was nice. The tour guide was very nice and was able to explain all of our questions. There was very interesting scenery both inside and outside of the cave. Very beautiful formations. Unfortunately we went during the winter so we were unable to sift for gems and stuff, but you were still allowed to buy bags and take them home to sift yourself. We got to pet different animals as well. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I have no complaints. I would recommend this to all ages, because the adults, teens and toddlers all enjoyed it quite a bit. Awesome place to visit! Oh, and the gift shop was really cool, and the prices were very cheap."

Real attractions are Hershey trolley tour, thrilling coaster rides, Hershey garden with hundreds of butterflies from around the world, Zoo america with exotic animals, Milton S Hershey museum experience. Lovely dining restaurants. Kids too enjoyed a lot. Will visit again with kids soon.Ample of parking space. Certainly recommend to others.....",
   "There is some major changes happening this year, including an expanded entrance much closer to convince world, and a new roller coaster for thrill seekers. I will always return here my kids love it. The water park is awesome for a hot summer day. There is a large variety of things to do for every age!",
   "I absolutely love this place. Rides for every age. If you have a ride around the age of 5 and want to introduce roller coasters rides to them that go upside down / speed, look no more. This is a great start. I started with my child at age 4 here and now she's 9. My daughter loves roller coaster rides and becoming a thrill seeker.",
   "I had the best time ever at Hersheypark. Its Christmas lights alone are worth the trip.  It was an awesome experience to ride the train through the lights. The new Chocolate World is very fun and it has some free attractions. I will definitely come back. Tip: if you come after 6:30 p.m. you can reuse the same ticket next day (but you need to ask for).",
   "Hershey park has been a staple for central Pennsylvania. The park goes through phases of stagnant rides or outdated attractions but continues to update and keep people coming back. They have an abundance of rollercoasters and have added more sensory experiences. The park normally struggles with cleanliness so bring whatever you might need. Make sure you bring cash or was to get lockers or have someone watching all personal items. It can be an ideal location for opportunistic thieves but I have not personally had an issue. Food courts are crammed and can be a tedious task. The park used to have many food locations that made buying food seem less and much variety. Now there is one main hub that Continues to disappoint and and drain the pockets. Security is decent and they take it serious. Local law enforcement has many contingency plans in regards to park safety. Overall a great experience but with slow updates and conscience lacking the park definitely draws return visits less frequent."

   "The staff take very good care of the animals. They are healthy and their environments are clean. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. They always take time to answer questions. They also have a program that works with your phone to show you educational videos. It is a fun, family place to be.",
   "A good selection of animals to see for a little local Zoo. Especially being attached to a amusement park. The Zoo staff is very nice and do nice educational learnings at certain days and times during the week for kids. My daughters love to go there. Like normal Zoos there are some exhibits that make it hard to see the animals. The mountain lion enclosure especially is very hard, especially for kids. We have been there probably 15-20 times and have never seen but maybe a couple legs or tails ha gong out somewhere.",
   "Great little zoo. We went in November. Not crowded at all. Enjoyed seeing the bears, owls, wolves and the animals in the southwest exhibit (roadrunner was super cool). Perfect place to take a small child who has sensory issues. Was not overwhelming for him. We will definitely visit again.",
   "Nice outing for younger children on a late winter day.  Good tie in to a park or Chocolate World visit.  Not a vast array of animals, but enough to entertain a 2 year old.",
   "I appreciated the fact that apparently not many wild animals are inhabitants of North America, IF the zoo is an accurate depiction of this. Don't set aside a whole day to visit this zoo, it's more of an hour long visit.  Most action can be seen on a cool, cloudy, even rainy day: the bears might be active, you might see some action in the deer pen but overall there is not a ton to see, if you're used to the 'big' zoos. We, as in my family, hit the zoo often early in the morning, right at opening and are, many times, the only visitors. Walk around for an hour, enjoy the reptiles, desert, bears, otters, snowy owls, wolves and go back home.\n\nThe park is clean and well maintained as a part of Hershey Park. If you have the Hershey Park food plan or drink cup, you can fill it up in the zoo also."

   "Hershey\u2019s chocolate world is one of the most joyous experiences I\u2019ve ever had. Chocolate is my favorite food, so this is like heaven. The best part was create your own candy bar, where, as the name suggests, you make a chocolate bar. The gift shop also has tons of cool trinkets that you can\u2019t find anywhere else, such as Hershey themed legos, dolls, and toy cars. All in all, the whole place is really great.",
   "Fun stop to add to the travel books, great for adults and kids! Take a ride in a chocolate themed ride that bring you through a visually engaging guided tour of their chocolate factory inner workings. They have other interactive options like creating your own chocolate bar and plenty of different chocolate creations to purchase.",
   "We got there at opening on a Monday, and still ended up waiting an hour to see the 4D movie. Don\u2019t bother with the movie, it was less movie, way too much audience participation, the story was horrible, not sure I agree with the message they were sending, and the effects under the seat hurt. The free tour was great, because we were there so early, we just walked right on, and I thought it was very fun and informative. We also did the make your own chocolate bar experience. Worth it. You get to customize a chocolate bar, and the packaging. You get to watch it be made, and have a fun souvenir to take home! Don\u2019t bother with the candy in the gift shop, they don\u2019t have anything you can\u2019t get at your neighborhood Walmart or target for much cheaper (and I\u2019m from the west coast), but otherwise a very fun gift shop. My friend had the new hot chocolate that is advertised as having a full melted chocolate bar in it. It doesn\u2019t. Just a boat load of syrup. I also had the chocolate strawberries, they were great, and reasonably priced I thought.",
   "Interesting enough. The chocolate tour was short and sweet (pun intended) and free, so can\u2019t really complain. The other experiences were kinda pricey, but if you have kids I think its worth a try. Also, very clean.",
   "Awesome place with a HUGE assortment of flavors of chocolate and other sweets that you can only buy on the East Coast. Fun, festive and colorful place! As you walk in, you are hit with the typical Hershey chocolate mouth that will immediately get you salivating. Pretty fair prices and amazing staff. \nLove the free tour and ride from the parking lot to the main attraction."

The weather was cold and rainy so we stuck to the Butterfly Garden and the Christmas tree show case.

You get wooden chip which activate different kiosks throughout the museum, personalizing your experience.

All in all we loved our visit here and would highly recommend!",

We enjoyed the interactive displays. We only purchased the Basic Museum experience. The building is clean and well kept. The workers were fun and knowledgeable. They made the experience much better for us all.",

The cashier will hand over a coin which provides the interactive part of the tour. You activate the coin and put in your information. Then you enter the museum via a long and luxurious stairwell (or elevator) and you'll be supplied with a scavenger hunt paper which leads you through the story and ensures you don't miss a thing.\nExpect to be educated about the life and times of Milton Hershey, his machines, extravagant purchases, including a beautiful chandelier and a Titanic ticket and his establishing of the town of Hershey.\n\nWell done Hershey Entertainment!",

   "This very much was an enjoyable and enlightening experience. Such an interesting and inspiring story that is told about Milton.  Very engaging with some pretty high tech exhibits that will inform you of just about every aspect of the Hershey experience. Definitely worth a visit the next time you stop at Hershey!"

We took our 2 year old and he had a blast even though a few themes were geared for children above his age.   I feel this is an excellent alternative to a playground when the weather isn't cooperating or just to mix things up.   There is a price point per person, so you lose value if 2 adults bring 1 child.",
   "Idea has potential but this location fell short in execution IMO. Additionally, there are signs EVERYWHERE telling parents and kids what not to do. I attached a small sampling of them.\n\nIf your business caters to kids under 6 or so, they may not know that the groceries cannot possibly 'make sense' to be in the postal office. And if they do, who cares?! Well, the proprietor of this location thinks very differently.\n\nFor $7/ea (parents must pay too), it's an expensive place to play with donated toys that are limited to their pre-designed spots only.\n\nAlso noticed prices going up soon. It will be $10 each over two hours. Not that you'll stay that long to begin with...",
   "Super cute idea! Loved that I could let the kids run around and be as little or as much involved as I wanted. I will say that maybe some music would be nice, theres a stereo system that isn't used except to alert the time left for the party. Overall lots of fun though.",

   "Great place. The trail is rocky and narrow so you sometimes have to stop to let others pass. The steps are at times twice the height of a normal step, so I would suggest using a walking stick. The stick/cane will help go up and also help to slow your speed on the way down.\nTake a binocular if you have one. Yesterday Thursday Feb 20,2020 around 5 pm I saw a pair of bald eagles flying in the distance beyond Hawk's Rock. This was a treat and a lucky sighting. This is the 1st time I'm seen Bald Eagles here coming here for over 3 years. \nBe sure to take water with you, because the the steps will drain your energy and calories on the way up.",
   "My wife and I enjoyed hiking to Hawk Rock overlook this week.  The hike itself and the view at the top are totally worth it!  The trail is easy to follow and maintained very well; however, you do gain a lot of elevation, so the hike is moderately strenuous. There are many stone steps built into the mountain to help your climb.  Most of the hike is along a portion of the Appalachian Trail. We found the trail head easy to find - there's a huge sign that you can't miss. Would do this again for the opportunity to sit at the top, enjoy the breeze, and see the surrounding countryside!",

   "This is an amazing museum! The grounds themselves are so awesome! They've got tracked vehicles, artillery pieces, replicas of old Army buildings/barracks, and even a trench! My favorite was the pill box, that was pretty eye opening. Inside you have a ridiculously detailed museum, truly incredible. Great place for vets, history buffs and civies alike.",
   "We just did the outdoor trail and most of the buildings were locked.  Not sure why, I think they were getting ready for some event.  It was an interesting place and a nice walk.  The Trench exhibit was quite interesting.  It just would have been better if we had been able to get inside some of the exhibits.",
   "A wonderful place to visit with family of all ages. The interactive displays were enjoyed by all. Very educational and the trail is a nice walk with beautifully displayed military hardware! An excellent place to visit, explore and learn about our great Army!",
   "As a Iraq war vet, it was nice to tour this place!  I'm huge into military history and this was great!  I will be coming back for sure, I really enjoyed it!",
   "I am Glad I found this Place! Lots of History and terrific Displays! I recommend the walking trails out back with the different military objects."

   "I\u2019ve known about Cullari for a while as they\u2019re on of my mom\u2019s favorite wineries, but I had yet to venture to their tasting room. The tasting was not rushed, completely reasonably priced, and you keep the glass for no extra charge. The staff was friendly and knew a lot about the wines. It was the only tasting that we have been to where we were able to sit down, have snacks, and actually enjoy the wines without being rushed to the next taste. The two women working the shop when we went were great, and we stayed much longer than anticipated because we just enjoyed their company so much. My wife bought a bottle of the Pink Orchid, but we easily could have purchased a bottle of each.",
   "We visited on Sunday 2/10 and enjoyed great wine served by a very friendly and knowledgeable hostess! Cocoa Nostra wine was pleasantly delicious. Also took a bottle home of the old world red, great table wine. Cute and cozy atmosphere.",
   "Very friendly. Wine was great. Nice variety clerk was entertaining \u2764\ufe0f",
   "Wonderful experience. The gentleman was so helpful and fun to talk with. The ambiance is very nice and comfortable. A nice place to sit and relax with a wine tasting.",
   "Jenna and Larry made this visit a great one for me. Very personable and knowledgeable when it comes to wine and food/snack pairing. The wines are great and reasonably priced. Coco Nostro is my favorite. Pinot Noir and Sweet Chambourcin were smooth and fruity!"

Plenty of parking is available, though on well attended events off-site parking is added with shuttle service. Today I was able to park next to the complex. The complex has restrooms and food stands through out the building. Parking charges are high at times, but the proceeds go to PA agriculture funds and outreach. Definitely a place to attend an event of your liking.",
   "Pennsylvania's finest farm show.  I highly recommend going and enjoying one of PA staple shows.  Amazing people and food. Animals are always gentle and safe for kids of all ages. Lots of history behind this once a year venue.\n\nI highly recommend being there when they open.  Plenty of parking across the street,  you'll also beat the crowds and enjoy the animals the best.  When early lunch comes, the food court will be still manageable and plenty room to sit or stand.\n\nEnjoy...",
   "I definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes - there is so much to see! Love seeing all the farm animals. You get an appreciation for all the work that goes into farming. Make sure to stop and watch some demonstrations and presentations at the stages and arenas. The more time you allow the better.",
   "Very good got there this morning 45 minutes before it opened 9 it open we got in. No problem at all walked around But as time goes by the vendors change. different ones that was a lot of AR aftermarket accessories there a whole lot.... Ammunition and shell prices we're in line some of the quantity discounts were pretty good.. I thought the food was just a little high but that's vendors I understand and not they are open everyday like McDonald's to got to make it in three day five days ...",
   "Great location for any size trade show or expo. Easy access parking and plenty of local hotels and restaurants to choose from. Access to I-81 is super easy. Definitely a venue to come back to and one that you would hope to be used for your next event or show."

   "Pros: maybe the best view in the Harrisburg area- with a swing on the power line at the very top!(and a boat too but hey whatever you think you need)\nCons: getting to the top is horribly marked and overgrown. Because much of it is below power lines  the trail is full of loose stones and it\u2019s very easy to lose your footing and fall into the thorny brush because it is not well maintained.",
   "This was a mildly hard hike, that makes you want to stop and go back, but then you keep going. The peek is gorgeous and I would 100percent go again.",

Spend the extra money to include this in your ticket as it\u2019s both fun to create your own ice cream and rewarding to eat a pint of your own creation. Both kids and adults were enjoying it. \n\nThe experience upstairs was cute, but mostly designed for kids. Happy we had a chance to see it and taste some of the label\u2019s current flavours. We had fun designing packaging for our ice cream flavour.",
   "Very cute experience with my 5 year old.  We explored the place for 4 hours and did the ice cream making class.  The plain ice cream they gave was amazing.  But it was fun to add in the toppings.   The class was informative as well.  Afterwards, we explored the play area, free ice tea area, awesome slide, free popcorn and more free ice cream.  \n\nThe five year old didn\u2019t want to leave but we eventually did to go eat a late lunch.  \n\nI\u2019d recommend to a friend with kids 4-10.",
   "It was a fun afternoon to spend with friends on a rainy day. \nWe enjoyed the museum, but were surprised to find how child-focused it was. There's nothing wrong with that, but it wasn't quite what we expected. \nWe participated in the tasting lab to create our own ice cream flavor which we enjoyed a lot. Tour samples are generous.",

This tower is very thrilling, you are not even expecting moving and wham, you are launched super fast to the top of the tower, fly out of your seat and before you can comprehend what is happening you go back down a short way. On the way back up the second time, my son had his head in the direction of the over-shoulder harness, and when we made it to the top and got the air time, he got a bloody nose from smashing his head into the harness. He still loved it though, it was a bit too intense for me though. Great fun anyways, and a must experience thrill!",

   "I visited today with my friend and we both wanted to order the chicken bulgogi. Our waitress was nice to start, and she recommended we order the lunch special which included a side salad. The lunch special was $11 with the salad included where as the dinner portion was $13, so my friend and I both agreed on the lunch special. The food was very good and we enjoyed our meal, but when the waitress brought the checks by, we were both charged the dinner portion ($13) and an extra $3.75 for the side salad. I told the waitress it was a mistake since she had specifically recommended the lunch special which included the salad. She apologized and admitted it was her mistake for not letting us know that we would be charged extra but insisted the manager said there\u2019s nothing they could do. The manager came over and was incredibly rude. There was a bit back and forth between us with me trying to explain the issue. She finally stopped pushing it and grabbed the checks, discounted them, and then brought them back and cleared our table in a forceful way without saying a word. Her demeanor was very unprofessional and caused us to feel awkward and unwelcome. A good business would accommodate for their customers, especially when a mistake was done on their part. I\u2019m glad they discounted the check, and the food was great, but the service needs a bit of work.",
   "Nice, Small restaurant. \n\nPastas are all fresh & good except lobster crab mac & cheese. Macaroni was just a bit undercooked.\n\nWe had crab guacamole as appetizer,\n oxtail ragu pasta, squid ink pasta with shrimp, and lobster crab mac & cheese as main dishes, \nand Tiramisu and pistachio Gelato as dessert. \n\nThe only complaint was that sauce was a little too salty on all the pasta dishes.  Otherwise they all had very nice flavor.",
   "I \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93 everything about this restaurant\u2757  The food is exceptionally yummy & fresh.  The staff is friendly, and intentional about assuring you have a good dining experience and the prices are reasonable.  It's a small place in a cute walkable neighborhood.  It's unique & definitely NOT \"like every other restaurant.\"",
   "Ordered the seafood mac along w lasagna. Order came out on time lasagna had creamy smooth ricotta and seafood mac had lots of crab n shrimp very cheesy a tid bit pricey but def worth the trip thanks guys for staying open",
   "Delicious handmade pasta, great sauce and meatballs, super friendly service. The tiramisu was great, too! Ordered two cappuccinos to drink with dessert. Next time, we'll just order one, and share it, as the cappuccinos were so huge my wife could only drink half. Will definitely come again. Next time, we'll bring a bottle of red wine to drink with dinner. We're so grateful to live within easy walking distance of this amazing restaurant!"

   "We loved this place. We definitely want to visit again. The lamb dish and NY steak dish were great. The service was phenomenal by everyone that served us. Thank you!",
   "This place is phenomenal! From our drinks, to our appetizers, to our entrees. Everything was world class. This will be a new staple. Such a great ambiance as well. Seriously just go here immediately! You won't be disappointed!",
   "For $32 I needed a steak knife for my lobster tail. However, the linguini was flavorful and delicate and our Tuscano rib eye was beautiful",

   "Always a great dinner! Service is not super fast but I wouldn't expect it to be. Great specials--don't miss it for the Outdoors Show and Restaurant Weeks. I've never had room for dessert while there, but I've taken home their strawberry shortcake and it is packaged perfectly to enjoy at home.",
   "We just had a wonderful Easter takeout dinner from Dodge City. The portions were great and the food was very good.  We will each get another meal out of it.  It included a salad, full course main meal, rolls with cinnamon butter and dessert. We couldn\u2019t have been happier and the price was reasonable.  And they made the pickup very easy with virtually no contact with another person. Well done Dodge City!",
   "Don't be shallow and judge this book by its cover. Looks shabby and run down on the outside...And frankly, on the interior as well. But the food is amazing. The most tender steak in memory...mozzarella sticks that were actually breaded and fried from real mozzarella. The crab encrusted haddock was perfect with handcut fries from fresh potatoes. The wait staff was attentive and efficient, worthy of a healthy tip. Looking forward to being in the area again for another terrific meal.",
   "Great place for lunch or dinner. In between visits I forget how reasonable their pricing is. I usually get the prime rib sandwich and it is so tender. For only $11 it includes fries (which are fabulous!). The service is prompt and efficient. I've tried their french onion soup - also wonderful.",
   "I was here with a group. I myself did not get steak. Those who did said it was very good. I had the bison tots, which were delicious. The wedge salad was good but not super memorable. The Pork belly mac and cheese was not bad but was underwhelming. Maybe a more creative mix of cheese or a more creative presentation would help that. Maybe a few crispy pork belly pieces on top to suggest the soft pieces that lie beneath and some garnish would go a long way. I had the burger which was generous for the price and the bun, crispy onions, and fries were delicious. My big issue was that I ordered it medium well, and in my opinion it was medium rare at best. If I get sick it will be my fault for not sending it back, I just hate being \u201cthat guy\u201d. My first experience was a solid 4 stars."

   "Home 231 is my favorite sit down dining experience in the city of harrisburg. I love how their menu rotates seasonally and how fresh the local ingredients are. The staff is always friendly and offers some of the best service around. They have parking in a few places along the street they are located. Even better than all that though are the phenomenal choices for brunch. Home 231 has consistently been my favorite brunch spot for years, close to a decade now. A true gem in this great city. I\u2019m so thankful to have found this restaurant and look forward to supporting a great local spot for many years to come!",
   "Food was excellent. Service was a little spotty. Our server was pleasant but seemed to forget about us several times, including never bringing the 2nd cocktail that I ordered. Our food took awhile to show up. Maybe because we were outside on the patio? Overall, just need a little more attention to detail.",
   "Went for Sunday brunch and was not disappointed! You need a reservation to get in, so we ended up at the bar but they were still kind and attentive to us there. Really enjoyed the bloody Mary! Had chicken and waffles and the smoked salmon with poached eggs and both were delicious. Definitely check them out for brunch!",
   "Good food, wine & service! Parking is VERY CHALLENGING in this area of town!  We enjoyed the apps: General Tso's Cauliflower (EXCELLENT!), Roasted Veg Board (which is COLD by the way, not hot!!! Also be aware if you share, there won't be enough bread on the board. Asking for additional bread is $1.00 more. At $13 for the board, additional bread if needed shouldn't be an up charge. Just my opinion.) & fish stew as a soup option (which was very spicy to my palate & I sent it back, unusual for me). Dinner: We shared the cornbread which tasted great but it took a considerable amount of  time for the honey butter to come out so it didn't melt. I had the short rib w/grits (Amazing!!!), my husband had the rabbit which had a lot of bones & was very messy to cut the way it was served in the bowl with the other ingredients but he said it tasted good. For dessert, he had the 3 flavors of ice cream which was great & I had the apple cobbler...just ok & was cool in the center, not warm. Perhaps if we went on a weekday & not a busy Friday, the food would have been a bit better as expected by all the previous reviews. Don't get me wrong, it was good but for $165 (with tip) it should have been perfect. I don't mind spending money for great food that's worth it. We'll give it another try on a week night to see if the food is as good as previous Yelp & Google reviews. Service was excellent & we felt well attended to (Service gets 5 stars).",

   "Definitely a solid choice for brunch in downtown Harrisburg overall. The drinks get a little pricy but the food is reasonable for the level of quality and flavor. I had the Oyster Rockefeller Benedict which was I have to say was one of the best around. \n\nIt would have been a 5 star review for the food overall, however being that has been my second time at Cafe Fresco and each time my food took 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes to come out. \n\nSpeed it up and it's a 5 star restaurant!",

   "We dropped by for the Saturday Brunch. The food was uniformly excellent. My wife had a wonderful omelet, my breakfast baguette was fantastic. Our grandkid had pancakes with bananas and bourbon caramel sauce.  The service should have been better. The woman was nice and friendly, but oh so slow. We spent an hour an a half in the restaurant. It took ages to get the check because she spent that long gabbing with a coworker. So if you are in Harrisburg on Saturday, you want some really good food and a lot of time to kill, this is the place to go.",

   "We were traveling to see family for the holidays and got to talking with our flights captain before we boarded and asked if he had any recommendations for dining in Harrisburg and he recommended El Sol.\n\nNice atmosphere and decor, we felt like we were dining in a restaurant in Mexico. Come to find out the owner and head chef is from Mexico and he takes an incredible amount of pride in his place. You can tell that but the decor and more specifically the food.\n\nYou definitely won't leave hungry as they have huge portions and everything we ordered was served hot and tasty. We decided to sit in the bar and the bartender Mark was awesome. Great recommendations for the cocktails we had and he didn't skimp on the alcohol. \n\nDefinitely not expensive either like you would expect for a more upscale Mexican restaurant.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is interested in having some great food and great service.\n\nSafe Travels! SPGDL_Traveler",
   "I understand the pressure but this restaurant was unorganized with orders. As people were in and out I waited two hours for an order I never received. I also understand due to the epidemic the orders are coming in fast. But as a business you should respond to orders as received and continue to update the customers rather then tell them you don\u2019t know where their order is. Orders were made through the phone and they had memory of taking the order. Horrible place with horrible employees, please find employees who are dedicated instead of being frustrated every time a customer comes in.",
   "It's hard to find parking. But wow! The food was so freaking good! Best Mexican food I have ever had. The waiters are super kind and very welcoming. The fried ice cream is AMAZING as well!!!!!",
   "Very Friendly Staff and Manager !!!\nI Recommend this place.\nA couple things need some changes and I'm glad that the Manager was Open minded to get the Restaurant to Invite New Customers in to Experience this place.\nCheck out the make your own Bloody Mary Bar... I've never seen this before."

   "Being a college student, I'm by no means accustomed to fine dining. However, I took my girlfriend here one night because I wanted to treat her to something special, and special it was. For starters, the atmosphere was great. There was live music that night, and the decor wasn't over the top or anything- it was just right. Second, our waitress was a class act,  she was helpful with opinions on wine and menu items. The moscato was absolutely amazing, and our food was delicious (I had the scallop dish- would recommend). After our meal we walked the river front and it was one of the most perfect dates I've ever had. I will definitely return from time to time.",
   "Amazing! The food was spectacular and the service top notch. We loved the bread we were served as we were seated so the waiter brought us a box of the bread to take home with us at the end of the night. She had the lime and risotto shrimp, I had scallops. Dessert was a warm chocolate souffle... Heaven on a plate. The only down side was the noise level. The manager moved us to a quieter table in a corner that has sound dampening panels around it. So much better. The next time we go we will probably ask to be seated in the library. Highly recommend visiting the mansion.",
   "Because of some health issues I have decided to cut meat out of my diet.\nJanuary 31st. Is my last day for meat.\nSo I wanted to come here for my last meal (of meat) I had the prime rib, bone in.\nI ordered it medium rare. With garlic mashed potatoes and fresh veggies.\nI have been a meat eater my whole life.\nI have dined at Ruth Chris in Boston as well as Atlanta and Chicago, and those places are very good, but I would stack up the prime rib that I had at Char's against any one of those other places!\nI really mean that. It was done just right (and you don't get that much in Harrisburg PA) there was enough fat to add to the flavor, without being too fatty and the mashed and veggies we're good as well.\nI also like the cappuccino that I got after the meal. All in all it was a great meal. You could argue that it was somewhat pricey, but it was with it to finally get what I ordered, the way I ordered it.",
   "I will be back  had a chance to talk to the executive chef and understand why the food is good.  He loves the art of cooking and their fish is fresh daily.  So good!",
   "The food and atmosphere at Char's are exceptional. In the summer, the view of the river is so pretty. The servers are attentive and know their stuff. But the food is the star here. Favorites include the escargot appetizer and the risotto of the day. This time it was a parmesan crusted chicken breast with sausage risotto. Yum. A great place for celebrations and for anytime you want an amazing dinner."

Best to make a reservation if you're planning to go during a busy time of day.",

I had the Tom Yum soup, Thai Seafood salad and Pad Thai and the taste is amazing! If you enjoy local Thai flavors don\u2019t miss this place!",
   "This place is fantastic. Every dish is an explosion of good tastes, smells and great visual presentation.  Don't let the small parking lot and modest dining area fool you.  I would put this place in it's own special Asian food category.  If you haven't tried it, then you for sure should go and sample their board of fare.  Also, you can tell the wait person how spicy you want the food.",

Please note that Thai hot is very hot. While they are not open on Monday, you will find them busy other days of the week. The only issue is parking. I highly recommend car pooling if possible."

   "Perfect atmosphere, not to crowded. Amazing food. I got the crab cakes and veggies. Relaxing and laid back service. Jean Paul was awesome! Ask for him!",
   "Saturday around 7:30, I came in with a group of about 15 sober people to simply have a drink in the bar area. We made it easy on the bartender (who also called himself the General Manager) by ordering beer or wine rather than time-consuming craft cocktails. We did not occupy any of the tables or chairs and simply stood around the bar. This GM was overwhelmed and made us know it. As soon as we all got our drinks (and tipped him out), he became incredibly rude and told us the space was reserved for dinner guests with reservations even though we were feet away from the tables. After a few minutes, my mother-in-law calmly mentioned to him that his approach was aggressive and could have been handled better and he literally had a melt down and began yelling at her! He then proceeded to threaten to kick us out and said the owner would agree. He told us we could take the owner's card and call him - that his cell phone number was on it. Today I called the number only to find that it is not a cell phone, no one answered, there is no voicemail, and the email address is a general account for the business. In short, I've always thought the food was mediocre and overpriced, but I've always loved the bar and atmosphere. We were treated so rudely and for no reason (other than spending a few hundred dollars in 15 minutes) that now I can't even enjoy the bar. The bar-tender/GM was incredibly inappropriate and unprofessional. He should not be working in customer service.",

   "The hallmark of a quality cheeseburger is when you pick it up and the juice runs down to your elbows. That was the burger I had today. Thick, and juicy. Great little spot for lunch!",
   "Great food and friendly service.  The burger I had was superb. Just be aware that if you go, it's cash only."

   "We went without a reservation on a weeknight. It is a cute little place, and I could see it filling up quickly. The decor is nicely done. I love the out side tables, but I was happy to be in the air conditioned inside.\n\nI started out with a mojito. It was tasty and the sugar cane was a nice touch. \n\nI got the steak special (32) and my husband a pork dish (22) so we could share. The meat flavors were rich and complex. The rice and beans were much simpler. \n\nIt was a great meal and we will be back.",
   "Love Tres Cubanos.  We have been here several times.  You dream of a mojito--that's it.  Great cocktails all around and everything on the menu is better then expected.  Most restaurants in Harrisburg are hit-or-miss.  Tres Cubanos is not.  Consistently great food.",

The first time I did carry out the portions were too small, the second time coworkers and I ate the buffet the food was bland and not enough options. The server was rude, I was the only Black person at a table of 4 and He didn\u2019t clean my dirty plate until the lady next to me told him to",

We got our drinks right away, than our salads, than our meals. I think everyone had everything in 30 minutes... AND it was hot. Very impressed! I'll def be recommending this place",

There are lights strung up over the street and it's gorgeous at night. While this restaurant doesn't provide the cocktails that one might want to enjoy during an evening out, there are many bars and a couple more restaurants near by that serve alcohol. There's also a cute, authentic crepe spot just a hop skip and jump away for dessert.  Easily my favorite area of Harrisburg.",

   "This place is so good with the choices of food that they have. Monkey bread and Brie for an appetizer. Marinated chicken wings for an appetizer and grilled octopus for entree. Oh my God so good so wonderful please if you're in Harrisburg check this place out",
   "Stellar experience, honestly. I took my wife here for her 40th birthday, and we were both blown away by the service and quality of food. Our server Parker was very attentive and Michael the bartender went out of his way to make a custom drink that would make my wife\u2019s evening extra special. \n\nI have to recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality experience.",
   "Ad Lib has a great menu.  Their lunch specials are presented on a large, rectangular plate and offer a good value for the price and quality.  Their clam chowder is possibly the best I've ever had - rich and creamy with bacon added to enhance the flavor.  If you're a burger lover, you would be hard pressed to find one better than the Ad Lib Burger.  It is served on a pretzel roll with stone ground mustard (containing large seeds) and hand cut fries on the side.  Finally, if you're a seafood lover, order a couple of the giant shrimp from the 1700 Steakhouse menu. They are an expensive treat, but well worth it. Overall, Ad Lib delivers a superior dining experience which is commensurate with the price.",
   "We have been wanting to check this place out for a while and it did not disappoint. For starters the Bloody Mary's were spiced to perfection. Then I had the Pork Cheek Rye Bagel which was crazy good with hot sauce cream cheese!\n\nService was very good and quick!",
   "The burger I ordered was pretty decent even if the fries were a bit lacking. My wife ordered meatballs and was highly underwelmed by them. The cocktail and other alcoholic beverage options seem to be the strong suit here. I wouldn't be opposed to returning to explore more of the menu however so overall I will say I enjoyed my visit here but I have also had much more impressive experiences elsewhere."

   "THIS MAN IS THE TRUTH. Friendliest man alive. Extremely polite , caring and fun. Pretty little establishment and the crepes were TO.DIE.FOR. I think I wanted to spend an entire paycheck on Nutella banana crepes. 10/10 recommend",
   "My husband by ourselves or with friends and family have been coming here for years. The shop is intimate and cozy with window nooks and pillows and fur. In warmer weather there are cafe tables outside. It is very convenient to the Harrisburg Symphony and Open Stage and the Gamut Theatre and State Museum and Whitaker Center for example. We stop in for a dessert crepe and coffee or tea after a show or between meals after a museum visit. We go for lunch or dinner before a show and get a savory crepe/salad and a dessert crepe plus a drink for 1/2 the price of a meal at other restaurants and although it feels like time slows down a bit at Au Bon Lieu, the timing of the service is perfect and we always get to the show on time!",

Once they got busy, they were unable to handle their bar, and the drinks came out inconsistent, and worse tasting as the night went on. The drinks were top dollar, so for that price I expect them to be on point. The last round was so bad we decided not to drink them.",

   "Atmosphere is very relaxing, tastefully done, and preserves the architecture of the building with a slight (very slight) modern feel.\n\nFood is very good, menu offers something for all tastes.  Specialty cocktail menu is a nice touch as well.  We'll be back!",

We were there on an off day for the piano bar, but a patron was allowed to play piano by the owner and regaled us with what amounted to a tiny concert for our table as barring that patron, we were the only other guests for a while. \n\nI would highly recommend this place. The food is superb. The owner treats patrons like family. And the music is just the icing on the cake.",

   "Cute place! Loved the live piano music, the food was great, and it was a lovely atmosphere! Service was good too \ud83d\udc4d",
   "Would have liked to given 4 stars, but I just couldn't.  Is it it a downtown fine dining establishment or just an everyday place?  The piano player while very good was loud when we first arrived such that my wife and I had to talk in elevated voices to hear each other.  I finally asked our waitress if she could ask for lower volume, which she did and then once lowered I thought was appropriate for dining.  The food was good, but not extraordinary.   Our waitress was just OK as well.  Worth a try.",
   "I have always had a wonderful experience any time I have gone to Carley\u2019s. Though I was introduced to the location through Show Tune Sunday, I have been a patron outside of that event. The staff is always kind and professional. It\u2019s my go-to recommendation for people new to Harrisburg. I look forward to my next visit."

   "This restaurant has the best service and egg rolls you should try it for whoever is reading this.",
   "Fine spot for tasty Vietnamese food. Came here on a Friday I think. Looking forward to returning with my relatives. The bill was appropriate for the quality. Similar to a place in Denver I liked.",
   "This is definitely one of my most favorite little restaurants. It's fun with friends or just some quiet time for yourself. The food is the absolute best and the staff is awesome."

   "Good beer, good food and great service. Went on Saturday around 1pm and place was pretty full. Service couldn't have been better. Orders arrived to the table quicker than expected and everything tasted amazing. Parking can be tricky but just be patient because its worth it. Also several nice artist shops inside. First time visitor and was impressed. Wish there were more places like this!",
   "Food was sooo good. I wish I could eat more to try everything! Service was great. I particularly appreciate the kids menu with coloring and the salt dough. It's great to have a place to go with good for and drinks that the kids will enjoy too. Love the local ingredients!",
   "Good beer selection. Their brewer seems to know the way to a good beer.\nThe food's..... Marginal. The wife's burger was cooked perfectly and had a nice char taste. The fries were hot but slightly undercooked.\nI went for the pierogies. Didn't find the burnt ends on my plate and they were very dry dumplings. Nothing like the menu described and the main reason I picked the restaurant for the evening.\nMaybe the chef was having a bad night but...\nNot Recommended beyond bar food.\n:D",
   "I'd made a reservation for yesterday for a party of 8; it was for a birthday celebration for my boyfriend. The server was really friendly, the beer was delicious, and the food came out super fast. For a starter I got the Butternut Squash Bisque, which was phenomenal, and for the main course I got the Vegan Mushroom Stroganoff. Aside from it being extremely salty, it was still delicious. That was really the only vegan/vegetarian thing I seen on the menu (other than pizza). Of course, I was also chatting with 7 other people while I was looking at the menu, so I could've easily missed something. It was my first time here and there was so much to see! I can't wait to come back in the summertime and see the rooftop!",
   "Holy wow! First time here and we will certainly will be back! Atmosphere felt very cozy and staff was very friendly. The food was spot on amazing and you could tell that everything was just so fresh."

   "The Subway is a long established (1948) Italian restaurant.  I've been eating here since 1965.  Their Pizza won a Harrisburg area contest as the best Pizza, which was judged by the owners the five best Pizza restaurants in the area.  There is one personal size and it has a thin cracker crust along with all the other typical Italian food.  This place has been thriving for over 70 years in a downtown location in an era when restaurants are failing as quickly as they can open.  Go there & enjoy it!!",
   "I hadn't been here in years, but always remembered them for their peanut butter pie. I went in tonight with my boyfriend since he had never been there before. Our food was DELICIOUS!! He got a personal pizza, homemade sweet sauce & LOTS of it! I had the toasted ravioli bites (which are really hard to find these days). Sauce waa awesome! Had bits of meat in it (which is ALSO hard to find). Our waitress was Carmen & she was a sweetheart. Good price for the excellent meals you get. We will be returning--highly recommend!! They also carry a decent size wine selection as well!",
   "Best pizza in the area. If you like thin crust pizza you must try it. It is clear why this establishment has been around for so long. We have been coming here for many years and come back time and time again. All my family and friends love it too. Try the amazing house dressing on your salad and if you want a fantastic dessert try the peanut butter pie. Yum!",
   "The pizza is good, thin and crisp. Fast and friendly staff great lunch spot",
   "Delicious comfort food and excellent service. Strongly recommended!"

   "First time actually eating there. I was there for a retirement lunch for a colleague. We were a large group that emailed our menu choice ahead of time. Everything was ready when we got there. Our place settings were labeled with our name and meal selection. As we were seated our food was brought out. Everything was delicious. Not one complaint. Our Server was attentive, and the Owner came out to greet us. It was a wonderful dining experience.",
   "The food was just okay. Some seasoned well, some not enough and some was dry and overcooked. Space is very small. Dance area, bar and tables, plus DJ. We were seated at a table that was clearly in the way and we were bumped all night by people walking back and forth. Food was a little too pricey for what we got. I would love to try some more from their menu. I'd try to go when it was a little less crowded maybe.",
   "Our waitress Ms Paula was excellent, however our food was not prepared as ordered. The owner was not accommodating and refused to hear our concerns because he felt he already addressed the issue despite us wanting to address other concerns. Its unfortunate that black owned establishments have poor professional service especially when your willing to patronize them.\n\nI appreciate your response, however the Birthday Club and their event had nothing to do with the lack of  customer service my party and I received in the dining room.   I ordered a salmon salad and received a piece of salmon on a plate. I requested it be sent back and it was rushed back to me over a salad mix. Presentation was not flattering. Others received their food sporadically causing some to eat and complete their meals before others. Because it was a Birthday celebration many didn't want to upset the Birthday honoree by complaning about their food and lack of professionalism. We tipped our wait staff  handsomely, and strongly noted that we would not forget our treatment and experience. We should have been notified when we were seated by the manager and waitress about all house, happy hour, and dinner specials. We arrived prior to 7pm. Management should never dispute the customer especially a group of mature,  professional, proud paying women.",
   "We all loved our food. It was delicious. Very well seasoned so the flavor was off the charts. It reminded us of New Orleans. We definitely plan to dine there again.  And the service was delightful just rounded off the entire experience. I had the voodoo juice and gumbo with shrimps.",
   "The service was great! The food was pretty good, just not as good as I remember it being. My mom had the shrimp and grits. She absolutely loved it! The grilled chicken was a pleaser too. I was not too crazy about the fried chicken wings! We had a little group and the atmosphere was nice."

   "We decided to stop here for dinner on a Sunday. The place was empty. We were a bit worried, because usually that is a sign that it's not very popular. Let me tell you, the food was AMAZING!!  The staff was very kind, and as we were waiting to order, more and more people came in. It did take a very long time for our food to be served, but I feel that is because the food is very high quality. Each and every item was obviously cooked with such care. The flavors were amazing and to be honest, it was honestly some of the best Indian food I have ever had!! My one and only 'complaint' is that many people know that to get really good food, it takes a long prep time. So there were quite a few orders that were placed through Grub-Hub. We kept seeing orders go out, and I started to feel a little neglected, because our order seemed to take a long time to finally be brought out. But let me tell you. It was WORTH it!! I would wait an hour to have their food again! I am most definitely looking forward to returning! And , next time, I'm going to order a whole slew of food to take back with me, so I can have it the next day!!!",
   "Love the vegetarian options and they have a couple of unique fishes. Great service. We usually get carryout and are always satisfied. I do wish the buffet had more veggie options but regardless the food is really good.",
   "Really great food with a friendly staff making some excellent recommendations.  If you like culinary flavors and meals from India, this place should be on your must visit list.",
   "Wish I still lived in Harrisburg so I could order food from here more often. Food is spiced well and the flavors are good, not too heavy and service has always been good whenever we are there! Looking forward to coming here whenever we visit the area."

   "The best fresh Mediterranean food you can get. I have traveled the country and have never had fresher falafal than I had here. The flavor beyond authentic. Great prices as well you can beat the portion size. Amazing!",
   "Good place, and good service. The food is fresh so it's good. Wish it were just $1 dollar cheaper otherwise really good food",
   "Food was fabulous.  Loved my falafel wrap.  My table mates were also very happy with their meals.  And the dessert of ice cream and baklava was amazing.  Very casual, not a lot of atmosphere but will definitely go again.  And I heard they are expanding:)"

   "This is by far my new favorite spot in Harrisburg. Tucked beside Rubicon and above Mangia lies the best tapas restaurant in Harrisburg, putting the almighty Cork and Fork at a distant second. Great Spanish wines, superb service, and delicious plates await you, but, show up early as the place is small (rustic) and it began to fill up quickly around 6p on a Saturday. Worth any wait you may have.",
   "One of my top locations for delicious spanish food. Good place to hang and eat some good food. I had a cousin come into town and asked me to take him back here. Bring your hunger - portions are large.",
   "Their drinks are excellent. I really enjoyed the firefly. \nThe staff is very friendly and helpful. \nThe food was was absolutely delicious! \nThe Suba tacos I got were amazing. The fish was nicely cooked and the mango was a nice touch.  The Monte Caballo was tasty but I felt like maybe you should get more than two for the price. They're very small but very delicious.",
   "Excellent service at the bar with great recommendations. Food and drink excellent. Shared our plates and left pleasantly stuffed and satisfied."

He got collard greens and sweet potatoes. Omg! Everything was freakin awesome. The rice was cooked perfect.  The chops were fall of the bone and perfectly smothered! The sweet potatoes were mmmmm delish! We gave kudos to the cook, it was that good. The guys there were awesome...oh and to make it better, he don't add salt to his food!!! (: we got 2 (1 meat 2 sides) w 2 drinks for $12 (lunch special, an hour after it ended)..plus what we tipped um..We had left overs for reheats, too.

The beer is great and the food is not only delicious and creative, its plentiful. Prices are mid range for food that is top notch. I was very impressed as was my guest. Thanks Appalachian brewing!",

One sauce was a sweet spicy honey and the other was a tomato based. However the sauce already in the tacos was superb.",

It's worth the little bit of money you're going to spend here, cause the prices are very good and the lady behind the counter was really nice and  Courteous. I enjoyed it a lot.",

We ordered two grilled sandwiches (with veggies) along with hash brown patties. You could chose your \"cheesiness\" level - a nice customization for people who like their sandwich a bit cheesy!\n\nThe place has limited seating and a friendly service staff. We enjoyed our hot breakfast and will visit again. Hope they add more vegetarian options to the menu though!\n\nTip: Limited street parking is available right outside ($3/hr).",

   "I grabbed a late lunch here - no wait at 2pm!  I had a Huevos Rancheros breakfast sandwich on the biscuit bread option - very glad I made that choice, it was delicious.  It took a bit longer than expected for my sandwich to be ready, but when I ate it I found out why - it was cooked to perfection.  Perfectly grilled, cheese just the right amount of melted, the fried egg was over-hard just like I'd requested... YUM!  The service was very friendly and helpful.  The sitting area was clean and they have made good use of the small space - seating for 20-25 at 2 and 4 top tables.  If you are looking for a leisurely place to sit and eat, I would recommend coming outside of normal meal times to beat the rush."

They were good to tell me the wait on brisket, which was unfortunately longer than my lunch break, and instead I ordered the pulled pork with some worry... I usually don't like pork all that much. This however has made my list of good food. Delicious, juicy, and so much meat that some fell out despite my best efforts. And I WILL be coming back for that brisket!",
   "I went in to see what the establishment was about, as I love southern food. I was pleasantly surprised not only by the food, but by the hospitality, and better yet a sign that showcased that they fed homeless and had an honor roll program for kids. It's amazing not only to have pleasant service and good food, but to see hardworking people who just started out giving back to the community! Good luck in all you do!",

Their menu has all the classics - wings, pizza, etc - with some really fun twists and unique items as well. The Dark Side of the Mustard chicken sandwich is my personal favorite! They have a great beer menu with lots of local PA nods (they also make it a point to support independeny owned breweries, which I think is awesome). 10/10 will be back!",
   "I\u2019ve always liked coming to Midtown (especially Taco Tuesdays!) but they recently started offering brunch. We came with a large group and half of us ordered the chicken and waffles. Without exaggeration, it was the best chicken and waffles I\u2019ve ever had. It comes as a small sandwich and is made with a raspberry Melba sauce. The chicken was wonderfully seasoned. I\u2019m probably going to be here every Sunday for the next month.",

The pita was ok, nice veggie mix but no seasoning that I could catch. The whole thing was sort of blah and I didn't feel well after - like it didn't sit right. \n\nThe chicken souvlaki was offensive. As a Greek I have high expectations and honestly if you can't make a decent souvlaki...there's just no excuse. It was bone dry, and no garlic, lemon, or oregano to speak of. I don't understand how this could go so wrong. Guys hit me up, my recipe is bomb and I will seriously give it to you!!\n\nI'd wanted to visit this place for so long, and I was so excited.

   "If I could leave 0 stars, I would. I heard good things about this place so I decided to order food and have it delivered. They say they send you a confirmation e-mail after ordering. After almost 30 minutes, I hadn't received it so I called to verify that they had my order. After saying yes, the girl on the phone then hung up on me. An hour and 15 minutes later, I still had no delivery. I called again to see where my order was and POLITELY said that it had been over an hour. She god rude and proceeded to tell me that I only ordered 30 minutes prior. My call log clearly stated an hour and 14 minutes had passed. She proceeded to scream back to her kitchen (I'm guessing) and then said, it's on the way and hung up on me again. If you're looking for politeness, I'd advise you to stay away from this place. Coming from a customer service position, I strive to be unlike these individuals every single day. Oh yeah, I still haven't gotten my food yet....",

   "I order from Yokohama online (beyondmenu app) all the time. Like several times a month, over the past probably 2+ years. From all of those orders, they only ever made ONE mistake. They had written my order down for pick up instead of delivery. Pretty minor mistake, which they immediately fixed after I called in by sending someone out to deliver it. They even tried (unprompted) to give me a discount for the wait. I gave the full amount + tip, and I'm pretty sure this just confused them.\n\nSorry, but I'm not sorry. Here's the thing: I appreciate what they do and I love their food. I don't think any less of them and I will continue to order regularly. They've never messed up the food in my orders (kind of unheard of in this industry) and the attention to detail in packing everything for travel is impressive. Perhaps most important: everything is delicious!\n\nIf you haven't tried Yokohama yet, why not?? And if you have, but they happened to make a mistake, why not try them again? That might've been the only mistake they make for you for 2+ years.",
   "Everything is \"OH SO FRESH\"! So we wanted to have Asian cuisine for Valentine's day. The first place we went to was overly packed and highly disorganized. The second place we tried making a reservation only to have then tell us they have to push it back an hour and a half. We got to our car, did one last search to try and find something locally and Yokohama popped up in the search bar 4 min away from where we were at. We got there and there was just 1 other couple in there so I was a bit sketched at first. But once I started trying the appetizers and random pieces of sushi or shisimi the taste was probably the freshest I've experienced since I started eating these delicacies. Will definitely go back again and will probably not go anywhere else just based off of the QUALITY of their food. Plus their wasabi is DA BOMB!! THANK FOR A GREAT TIME YOKOHAMA!! BE BACK SOON!",
   "You'd never know this was here, just riding by, it looks vacant. The food is ALWAYS fresh. Service isn't super fast, but I've had slower, so I don't mind. I took my kids (6 and 8 years old) but there's no kids menu. They split a hibachi chicken entree. The Thai iced tea reminds me of bubble tea(A MUST HAVE) and the appetizer was piping hot. Arrived around 5:35 on a Friday and we were the only patrons dining in. By 6:15 the place was half filled. In a nutshell, this place is a gem, for sure!"

   "The food is GREAT here. My favorite dish would have to be the oxtails and rice n beans. The food portions are HUGE. I usually divide 3 portions from just one plate.",
   "I\u2019m a vegetarian and I ordered their rice and beans with cabbage and onions on top- best decision I\u2019ve ever made! Nothing better. Friendly service and great prices. Get the hot sauce and coco bread, and you\u2019ll have the best meal ever.",
   "The reviews on this Restaurant are hilarious! The owners are all African! There will be cultural differences, be respectful. The Restaurant is seat yourself, and there is an African family vibe that I love. \n\nAlso, this Restaurant  mostly caters to west African foods. Wouldn't recommend the Jamaican foods bc the cooks are from Niger. Great west African soups!\n\nAmericans- go for the meat pies! : )",
   "Authentic and home made food. It was a great restaurant for some very different food than we are used to eating. Great prices and service!",
   "Was traveling from up state PA to Philly...Greyhound overlay in Harrisburg so decided to find some close good grub, found a gem. Good blend of African and Jamaican food. I got the Curry Chicken, but it smelled like African food..it was kind both, was good though!"

   "Do not be fooled by this rough exterior, the food is to die for!! Full of the right flavors, made with love you can taste. The cake is amazing (lemon is my favorite).  The catfish is crispy and tender at the same time (without being slimy inside the batter) and the everything wings are a must try!!",
   "I STOP BY TODAY SURE GLAD I DID IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST CHEESEBURGER SUB I EVER TASTED 5/25/17",
   "twice a year, i get to eat anything i want. i love this place.  prices are good. since i found it, i always order fried fish, mac/cheese, greens or cabbage.  love the fish and cornbread every time.  a few weeks ago, cabbage was bland; the mac/cheese was just boiled mac w cheese on top.  disappointed to say the least. since we have to buy whole dinners, be consistent w your sides. i gave 5 stars cause the food is almost always perfect. for 1 who only gets to eat soul twice a year, i need satisfaction both times.",
   "Good Soulfood! This was my first visit but not the last.  The food was Hot, fresh, and delicious.  Because I'm from Florida I know good soul food and this was Good.",
   "The food was very good. I loved the collard greens, baked beans, mac n cheese, wings, shrimp. It was all so good. We are from the south and its hard finding a place that has good southern foods. We will be back"

   "Well I move here to Harrisburg 2 years ago and I never could find a good Chinese food so my sis told my wife about this place so just 20 minutes for the first time I try it and I have to give u  a 5 stars because the ladies was nice the food is amazing keep up the good work",
   "Favorite Spot... Fried Chicken, cheese fries, shrimp egg foo young, Shrimp Chow mein allll of that is on point.",
   "Grew up a couple blocks from this spot and it\u2019s always been a gem. Not much for atmosphere inside there lol \ud83d\ude02 but the food is always tasty and they hook you up with good portions too. Known for chicken wings and General tso\u2019s.",
   "Lived in Harrisburg for 8 years before coming here. What have I been doing with my life!?\n\nI think this may be one of those places that remains a well kept local secret. Lots of foot traffic on a Thursday night.\n\nService was friendly and prompt, food was cheap and fresh. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone looking for some fairly cheap and very delicious take out. \n\nI recommend the bean curd in house sauce, you could easily feed 2 with it on the cheap. General Tso\u2019s chicken is also plenty good. Be forewarned they want $8+ to use a credit card.",
   "The atmosphere of this restaurant was, bad to say the least. The food however was great! Get to this restaurant on busy days and you won't regret it because there is a lot of fresh food and for $8 not much else to say other than it looks to have a lot of parking and it is quick, looks be in a shady part of town but don't be intimidated it's a good restaurant at heart."

   "Very nice staff! The wings were ultra yummy and the fries were perfect!! Good food to veg out and watch a movie \ud83d\ude01",
   "It took a while to get to place an order but once order was placed food came out very fast. Chicken gyro was very good, fresh cut fries are good as well. Their wing sauces are very unique and good. Beer was a little pricey, a draft of Dirt Wolf IPA was $7.",
   "Good food with what appeared to be an updated menu since the last time I was there. The fish sandwich was hand battered and tasted great. Very good and the cream of crab was excellent as well. The food and prices are worth it.",
   "A favorite hangout with a view of the river. Great beer selection and great food. A really fun place the the deck has the doors up.",
   "Food was great! I had the Crown burger and she had a Rueben, both looked great and tasted better. Also tried the Maryland Crab soup and it was also great! Typical sports bar scene that had plenty of TVs with all the games playing. Had a view of at least 3 games from my seat and could see 2 more if I looked around. The service was a bit slow but they were packed full so that's to be expected. The staff was friendly and very personable, did not feel neglected even tho they were very busy. We will be back next time we're in midtown for anything."

   "AUTHENTIC & DELICIOUS QUALITY FOOD! \nSo sad I couldn\u2019t get a picture of my entree. Deserts are made to order and from SCRATCH!! You can see them cooking your food. The place is very clean, kid friendly and friendly staff. The food was PERFECT! Fresh, flavorful and good amounts. This place is a 10 STAR! The best is PA for sure!!!",
   "Ok to start I want to tell you that this place is a gem. The staff is super friendly, ask for Ana she is super nice and attends so nice, you won't be disappoint. Those who work in the kitchen they have a special hand for cooking. The truth is that I recommend this place, to eat,hangouts and have a good time, they will make you feel welcome and treat you like family. And I travel from Lancaster which are about 45 minutes and it's really worth it. Authentic Mexican cuisine with a lot of flavor.",
   "Listen, guys. I NEVER write any reviews, but tonight I feel like I have to. This food is absolutely AMAZING! Tastes like authentic home cooked food, unbelievable. My husband and I are very impressed. Great way to celebrate Cinco da Mayo! Ordering again soon, for sure!!",
   "I was very impressed with El Rancho. Me and the wife decided to come in on a sunday afternoon when half the restaurants in Downtown Harrisburg are closed. I had some tacos and she had a taco salad. The flavors of everything were top notch. I hope this places gets more business because it definitely hit the mark for us.",
   "I wanted tacos, so we came into Harrisburg on a Saturday afternoon and none of the other restaurants opened until 4:00 p.m. We found that this place was open and fit the bill for my taco craving. It was delicious and fast!"
