   "What an impressive museum!!  We spent much longer there than we initially intended. Lots of interesting information, and the mine area was so very impressive!!  You really get a taste of what it was like to work underground in a mine!! They are working on a new natural history area that should be quite spectacular too!! Don't pass it up!",
   "I've been to lots of museums.  This by far has the greatest diversity of interesting & informative high quality displays.  From diverse geological, zoological, historic, numismatic, mining history, Mammoth skeleton, and so much more.  Allow 3 hours to breeze through.  This museum is a must see!",
   "Fantastic collections.  They've restored one of the original coin mint machines and it is fascinating.  The weapons collection is extensive and really interesting.  Lots of old-west artifacts.  They have a top-notch curator.",
   "If you\u2019re anywhere near Reno go ride the steam locomotives! The ride there was nice also. The Wild mustangs we saw on the way back were worth the trip. Also close by is Virginia city. Cool stuff!",
   "I stop here everytime I am in town as its quite cheap and very interesting place to spend a few hours! The guy up front is probably one of the nicest people you will meet, wish I got his name but I hope he knows how great he is!\n\nI decided to get an annual pass this time around and I'm already counting down the days till I go back!\n\nIf you get a chance to stop by I highly recommend it!"

   "We went right before Christmas and took our 3-year old & our 10-month old. I believe the train that gave rides is one of only 2 or 3The trains are decorated for Christmas. Santa and his helper boarded and rode the train, which thrilled the children. Santa & helper gave candy canes to passengers. Inside the museum are refinished beautiful old steam engines. We will go again.",
   "Not a huge place, but great display of probably the most historic moment in rails... The Golden Spike ceremony. Worth the trip if you like history.",
   "Went for the Christmas Train Ride!  My whole family has a fantastic time especially our four grandkids!  The museum was amazing,  the train conductors told us wonderful stories about the old but beautiful trains,  and we had a lot of fun in the gift shop!  We had great time!  \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udc99",

   "So close to town. Easy trail to the waterfall. Local trail enthusiasts and forest service collaborated to create an additional loop trail (waterfall trail is short spur off this loop trail). It takes hikers up one ridge, back down to creek above waterfall, then up along the opposite ridge and back down the the parking area. Really well laid out trail never gets too steep. About 1.8 miles total. Great views of Carson City and Westside hills. A must-do. Just follow King St west to the parking area.",

   "I took the my daycare kids to see the museum I haven't been for a long time and they loved it. However, I wish it was a little bit more interactive. You can keep the history part of the whole museum but add more in depth learning to it for all ages. Infants to teens will honestly want to know more and I feel like if there is more to do for the kids than more and more kids will want to come. \n\nWe did have fun though! And the front desk ladies were super sweet!",
   "This is a amazing placing for children under 10 years old.  The museum is got so much hands on AND it is parent friendly.  Very little bending over, lots of things that parent and child do together.\n\nThe price is near perfect and the activities and numerous.  \n\nPlan to spend a couple of hours for sure. Also don't miss out on a chance to be an engineer driving a train.",
   "My kids loved it. There was a ton of stuff to do. It seemed very clean and fairly cheap. Kids are 5 and 1-1/2",
   "I don't know what I was expecting when I brought my daughter, but this wasn't it (i think i was expecting organized museum flow - like one display/exhibit flowing smoothly into another). But this was - - - Kids running everywhere, rickety building (that has it's own charm to be sure), a huge room with chaos and 'exhibits' seemingly everywhere... But once i was committed (10$?? 15$?) - it's actually pretty dang cool.  There's a little bit of something for everyone and it's very much a place for kids to explore new things.  There's music stations, nutrition stations, Nevada history stations, plus a whole bunch of other things.  I will definitely go back for a rainy day visit with my kid to explore more. It is also a venue option for kids birthday parties which I would also consider for the future.",

This place for hanging out, gambling a bit or eating is really special. It might have been a real popular place back in the \"good ole' days\", but now, not many folks visit here.  All of the staff members we interacted with were great. Very pleasant and helpful folks. Casino is large enough to enjoy yourself, but not so big as to \"get lost\". The real special place here is the \"eatery\" located inside of the Nugget. There were six of us on this trip and we ate here multiple times over several days. Encountering different server staff each time, and each staff member made our visit very special. It really seemed like they enjoyed their job. The food was excellent and the prices were astonishingly inexpensive. We all agreed that we would come back here if just for the dinning experiences only. Excellent experiences. Would highly recommend and will certainly return.",

I assure you will love here but will feel exhausted to hand carry a lot tools. The water looks unbelievable I think it\u2019s not worse than Hawaii. Again, the only difficulty is the path not so friendly for small kids. I believe that\u2019s why there are not so many people crowded. It\u2019s easy to find this place since you will see a lot of parking aside the road when you drive close. Finding a good parking location is important.",

The trailhead is relatively hard to spot so really keep an eye out on the west side of 28 about a mile from the Carson City/Washoe line.  If you see the parking lot to Marlette Lake on the right, just look across the highway to a very faint trail leading into the woods. \n\nThere's a reason why the Nevada shore is SO  much better than California's bawdy, built-up, touristy side. Most of the Nevada shoreline of Lake Tahoe is maintained as a wild, wilderness setting with only hike-in access to the water ... and that's exactly what you get here.  It's about a half-hour walk from the highway through deep woods to the beach so if you're carrying a floaty device it could take a bit.  My advice is to get here mid-week because on summer weekends it is impossible to find a spot on the beach and parking on the highway is spotty. Nevada troopers will leave a ticket on your windshield at certain spota. Five stars ... even with the all the skin on the beach. (Yes it is technically a nude beach.)",
   "This beach is lovely!  It's a bit of a walk down the hill from the parking lot and parking can get really packed so go early or be prepared to find parking on the street.  But it's totally worth it.",
   "Crystal clear waters are great for swimming, diving, and kayaking. Gets very crowded so be there early. There is limited parking and a hike down to the beach so don't carry a lot of things because it will be very exhausting on the way back up. One of the best beaches in Tahoe!",
   "Totally missed the chimney, but I saw everything else! An amazing beachfront that undoubtedly gets busy on the weekends. I went midweek during the summer, and the crowds weren't that bad.",
   "A Hidden Gem don't go to the place its  only for me and my husband..lol I'm just kidding this is a beautiful place if it's worth the half a mile walk down to it in the half-mile back up once you get there at the breathtaking with the cleanest water in the most beautiful rocks to perch on like a mermaid ..\ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc3c\ud83d\udc30\ud83d\udc07"

   "Great, walkable course for the money, with picturesque views of the Sierra Nevada. I've played it a number of times, most recently in October 2019, and the greens and fairways were in great shape, especially for the affordable price. IF the wind isn't blowing, this is one of the easier courses you can play, and one of the only coursed I've finished 18 holes without losing a ball. However, the wind blows nearly every afternoon, which is the course's main defense. But it's worth playing in the afternoon for the cheap rates, the relatively open course, and the magnificent sunsets behind the High Sierra.",

   "Great views of the whole lake. Easy 1.5 mile trail to hike. The beginning is very steep grade but it levels out on top. Easy parking at the trail head. This was first time there and would come back again for the views. There are picnic spots and benches to take a rest.",
   "Beautiful hike. We did it up and back in about 45 minutes. Amazing views and would be suitable for a family. It gets a little steep, but since it is less than a mile one way it wasn\u2019t a problem for anyone in our group. Went at 7 pm and had the trail to ourselves.",
   "Steep walk if you aren't used to inclines. Beautiful views at the top. Good spots for a picnic. No restrooms. No signs at the trailhead, parked on the side of the road with everyone else and walked up the barricaded road.",
   "Fantastic view and a relatively easy walk to the top. Look it up in advance and the start of the trail isn't signposted from the main road so you will be slightly unsure where you're going without maps.",
   "Nice paved walk upto scenic lookout of Lake Tahoe. Easy walk with good vertical climb to get the heart going."

   "Established in 1993, the Kit Carson Trail is designated by a painted BLUE LINE and the \u201cTalking Houses\u201d share their ninety-second narratives that provided insight and tales about the capital city and some of its more colorful personalities. You can  listen to sound effects such as horse-drawn carriages, train whistles, and John Wayne\u2019s voice at the Krebs-Peterson house where he made his last movie, \u201cThe Shootist,\u201d in 1976. The route also passed the home of Orion Clemens, where his brother Samuel Clemens aka Mark Twain would stay when he was in town. The tour features 60 landmarks along the trail including the former U.S. Post Office, U.S. Mint, Governor\u2019s Mansion, and the Carson Brewing Company, home of Tahoe Beer for more than 100 Years. For a nostalgic walk down the largest historic district in Nevada make tracks for the vivid BLUE LINE that will guide your way along the 2.5-mile path of Carson City\u2019s legacy to discover the Wild West!",

   "First off, let me just say, WOW.. Such an amazing and beautiful body of water. The entire area is so pretty and breathtaking. I was visiting while on a business trip in Carson City and one of the locals i befriended said I HAD to come check out the scenic route around the Lake Tahoe. They were 100% correct, as it was just amazing. The water is so clear, it looks like you could just scoop it up in a cup and drink it. I could easily move out here to enjoy this view and fantastic area every day.",
   "These moments are breathtaking.  The fam bam, the time, and a beautiful place.  The backdrop of Lake Tahoe is magnificent.  The lake is one of a kind.  One of the most beautiful places on earth.",
   "Amazing waterfront location - just come by early to snag parking. Would also recommend checking out their entrance ten min away from the beach. There are picnic tables and walking paths through the woods. A lovely 10mi loop incorporating a section of Tahoe Rim trail and some campgrounds there as well. Hikes includes a hike up a ridge for a magnificent view of entire Tahoe lake.",
   "One of my favorite place to rest and swim",
   "I checked this off my bucket list and let me tell you it was worth it! \nIf you decide to walk the 3 miles trail leading to Sand harbor beach, I can tell you right now, you will not be disappointed. This will be your view during your walk \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. Enjoy it"

   "Scenic overlooks of Lake Tahoe from the Southeast shore. Be careful though! The last part of the hike is for experts only in good physical condition. Lots of big steps AND using your hands for help. If you can make it to the top...your reward is an amazing 360 degree view. Enjoy!",
   "Beautiful 360 degree views once you hike the short trail. There is limited parking near the entrance of the trail, so reach early. There is so much to do around the area, you could easily spend a day on the trails and the nearby beach. If you want to watch a special sunset in the area, this comes highly recommended. Attaching some sunset shots :)",
   "Don't know where to start on this place but to summarize it in the nutshell it is short and very rewarding trail. You don't find trails like this very often it's like a gold nugget of the trail in my experience there's only few in my book trails that offer such reward. To get to the top of the rocks may not be suitable for everybody you will need to climb some rocks so older folks and younger kids might struggle here but you still will enjoy some views even if you don't climb to the top of the rock. My five-year-old daughter had no issues climbing to the top of the rocks obviously supervised. I would not attempt this if the weather is not perfect as the rocks might be slippery especially if it's snowing I would not go there.",
   "Love this place. I come over every time I visit lake Tahoe for some peaceful time by the rocks. Parking fee started recently but it's very reasonable. The scene from here is just amazing \ud83d\ude0d",
   "This place is beyond gorgeous! Nature can be so impressive sometimes...\nIt's as enjoyable in winter than in summer!"

   "Very picturesque with fun wildlife and surrounded by beautiful mountains. Since it is winter season one course was closed due to flooding and disappointingly there are no garbage cans along the course which led to unsightly littering near the bathrooms areas. Inside restrooms were surprisingly neat with space heaters for warmth (much appreciated). Plant life made it almost impossible to find and retrieve balls a foot into traps. Despite all we do look forward to coming back and enjoying the course during peak season.",
   "I love this course,  they are doing a great job revamping it after the flood. Twilight rates for 18 joles with a cart are only 20 bucks per person. Highly recommend",

Most places to see are soliciting you for cocktails while waiting.\n\nVirginia City has tons of history and much is located here.\n\nThere really was a lot of rhyme or reason for sequence of displays. But neat to see stuff that was 100+ years old.\n\nThere seems to be zero public restrooms in all of Virginia City...inclusive of here. Make sure you don't ask and use the restroom prior to admission.\n\nDont take American Express either...",
   "I love Virginia city so much history of the way it was a hard life for people that had gold fever. I think all the kids should come & see true pioneers & the difficult life they had instead of email it was the pony Express.",

Bonus points for a very talkative and adorable museum cat that sat behind the counter. If I ever get back to Virginia City I will be sure to go again."

The recreational areas are clean, have plenty of parking (especially off season) clean restrooms and the beaches were just lovely.",

Super clean, nice facilities (parking, bathrooms, playground, basketball court, benches, picnic tables), crystal clear water, gorgeous views and right in the center of a charming town.  Great way to relax after a morning filled with hiking!"

The mansion was beautifully preserved and we received a lot of paranormal activity.  The Mackay Mansion is truly haunted and I would highly recommend the tour \ud83d\ude0a",

   "We got there early. Just as they opened. The place is beautiful and well set up. We wanted to sit in the bar to watch the game but the bartender Brian told us they don\u2019t open until 10. Turns out they opened at 9:30 so he lied. Later we were trying to order drinks and I asked for a cherry coke and he told me to go to the cafe. A nicer bartender interjected and offered to pour a coke with grenadine which was perfect but I could tell Brian wasn\u2019t pleased. If you all get rid of this guy you\u2019d have a perfect 10 staff. Everyone (else) was very helpful and so friendly. My son loved the snowboarding and this being our first visit, we had a wonderful time. We\u2019ll be back. Just not looking forward to this Brian guy. Ugh!",
   "It has been a few years since we went here.   They used to be pretty good, they have made huge progress towards great.  Fast/ excellent lifts to fairly advanced terrain, magic carpet for beginners.  Great for all skill levels.  Lift staff is clearly kept in line, polite, helpful.  We had a kid lose a ticket, no problem.  \nA fabulous spot, we need to go back.",
   "A friend told me that this was a family friendly place, perfect for first time kids.  It was perfect!  First, the price can't be beat.   I paid for 1st time lessons for 3 kids. They got a 2 hour lesson plus the snowboard and the boots. The first place I was going to take them was very expensive compared to here. In fact, I would have paid the same amount for one lesson at the other location that I paid for all 3 lessons at Mount Rose. Second,  Even though we ran late because of traffic, the staff was so pleasant, courteous, and professional. They took care of the kids and made sure that everything fit and that they had everything in place before the lesson started. And during lesson they were very patient and positive and supportive. Third, I could sit on the deck, in the sun, taking photos and videos of the kids  As they took their lessons cama road up the Hill for the 1st time, and then came down the Hill. Facilities are older and need TLC.  I would give it 5 stars but the bathrooms were filthy and interior was dark and run down.   The kid's got dressed in the car because there were no facilities for them to change and put away their clothes inside the lodge.  I would definitely recommend Mt. Rose without hesitation, and I know we will be going back.",
   "I've lived in Reno for almost 3 years but hadn't boarded at Mt. Rose yet until today. I had an absolute blast there today! The snow was great and the variety of runs kept things interesting. I felt like their 6 person lifts ran really quickly, enabling more riding time. I will highly consider getting a season pass here next year, as it only takes about 40 min to get there from the north side of town and the parking situation there is excellent, especially if you park at the bottom of the Slide Side.",
   "Haven't been skiing in years & it was my daughter's first time. Matt gave us our lesson. He was awesome (as were most all the employees we encountered). We had a blast, even this late in the season. The weather was beautiful & it was not crowded at all (Thursday). Will go again!!"

I used my phone to capture EVPs and had a few experiences that validated others findings. Upstairs, in the room with the long mirror made from Diamond Dust, I was over looking into the mirror, while the rest of the tour group was learning about different things. I remember feeling like someone was behind me and after later going through my audio footage, I caught the sound of faint cowboy boots with spurs clinking, eventually grow louder and stopping next to me. I\u2019ve also caught poker chips clinking, as well as voices interacting. Quite the experience. Loved it. Would definitely recommend and like to go again.",

   "We love this place.  I used to live in Virginia city and hang out here. And those ghost stories are real!!! Its ghost adventure heaven.  The back room where the crypt is will raise the hair on the most jaded head. And in the ladies room I swear I heard a lady humming but when I came out I was all on my onesie.

What else can you ask for.",
   "So beautiful. Love the views. You can get down on the island, on the beach, camp there, or just look from above with one of their many looking places. Very relaxing. Come here if you're coming to Tahoe. Defiantly worth the drive!",
   "Wonderful view of Lake Tahoe and Emerald Bay. Great for all kinds of nature photo shoots. Road going there is a little narrow, ... you have to drive slowly around the bends and going up there, but it's well worth the effort. Fresh mountain air all around and it can get busy there even if the weather is colder or not so nice with the usual blue skies and sunshine. Parking was around $10 (for the whole day I think, and it's self-serve at a kiosk) but there's no other fee to hike and wander around the area. Make sure you bring a drinking water bottle and good shoes to walk around the rocks, trails, etc.",

   "Went here for my first snowboarding lesson with Pete and he was great. Please  ignore the website that says come an 1hr before your class. If it is during peak season and on a weekend you're going to need more like 2hrs, that is if you are getting rentals because the lines where crazy long and they even ran out of rentals by noon. Other than that it was a good time. Staff was friendly and helpful.",
   "If you've ever been to Lake Tahoe and you love skiing this is the place for you. They have a great learning program for kids and adults. Some of the slopes give you a breathtaking view of the high mountains and the enormous lake. Me being one, I really recommend this place for tourists.",
   "The ski school was horrible.  Very unorganized.  The person in charge of ski school was rude.  Booked my daughter for an afternoon lesson, the class started.  They told us to check her in to another class by going back into the building to re-do the check out process after we've already done it.  It's hard to walk back there, slippery and having to carry all her ski equipment that we rented.  The person in charge was not accommodating.  The instructors were pretty nice.  I had Larry for a class next day, he was good.  My daughter had Bobby G for full day class the next day and liked him.  But I would not recommend this place.",
   "Our family used to love Diamond Peak - small, affordable, generally not crowded, and easy to navigate. However, they have ruined everything by making 2 of my family's favorite runs into jumps, so we end up doing the same run over and over again - boring and crowded. Not sure we will come back. Please bring back the runs we all loved so much for some variety. Thank you",
   "My friends and I love this place!! We are all different level skiers, ranging from green to black, so this ski resort was perfect for everyone! The lodge was not too crowded on the day we went, so after we skied, we all hung out in the lounge and had fun by the fire. Coming here again for more winter retreats!"

   "My wife and I absolutely loved this cruise. Totally worth the cost and would recommend to others. \nI would go when the weather is nice. It gets really cold there especially if the wind is blowing on you. There are a couple things that could be improved upon. One of the speakers on the deck was really distorted sounding. It should be replaced if it hasn\u2019t been already. The TV/video monitors that were playing a documentary about Lake Tahoe need to be updated. The quality was bad but the documentary was fascinating. \nWe went for the cruise and it didn\u2019t disappoint.\nThe big paddle wheel was super cool too.",
   "Took my daughter on her first miss Dixie cruise. She loved it. Lunch on board was great. Highly recommend",
   "Lots of fun and beautiful cruise itinerary across the lake to Emerald Bay.  We did the 3 hour dinner cruise. The food was okay, beer and wine inexpensive, mixed drinks ten bucks. The band was enjoyable.  A wonderful way to see the lake!",
   "A great cruise that took 2.5 hours. Excellent landscapes. It covers the southern part of the lake and it is worth to try it",
   "Great views. No rocking on the boat which was wonderful! The sunset cruise was great. Food was pretty good. I had a salad, diner rolls, salmon with mixed vegetables, and cheesecake with strawberry drizzle. I\u2019d rate the food a 4/5. I\u2019d do the cruise again as it was comfortable And having the food was an added plus. I wish the speakers outside were a bit louder as it was hard to hear the history of Vikingsholm with all the people on deck. Alcohol is served."

   "Brilliant tour! Slightly out of the way, but worth the visit. Our guide was hugely knowledgeable and clearly interested in the subject as well as keen to answer the many questions I had. The mine itself was authentic, a genuine experience which was fascinating as well as unique. Never been in a 19th century mine before, probably never will be again, but now I can say that I have. You won't be dissapointed.",
   "First off I will say this is a great tour, I've done it 2 times now. Once when my kids were a little younger and just recently and it doesn't disappoint. The guide is very nice and informative. Whenever you are in Virginia city this tour is a must.",
   "A place of history and culture that once thrived on gold & silver take a trip into the past, jump aboard the time machine and create some unique memories",
   "It was a delightful step back in time, John Tyson was exceptional as a guide & a crack up."

   "The beach is not a far walk from parking (on street or small designated areas). Definitely doable with kids. So many pretty sights.  The playground and restrooms are clean and well maintained.  When we were there they had free concerts going on. We will definitely return when in Lake Tahoe.",
   "We stopped by in between ski trips on a sunny and 50 degree day.  Breathtaking view and a nice playground made for happy kids and parents alike.",
   "Really great place to spend the time with the family. There are playground for children, the beach is so quiet to swimming and to play with surfboards, and a little trail for bikes and pedestrians. Very close there is a small pier where you can swimming as well. Highly recommended when you're travelling to Tahoe!",
   "I don't think so, I liked a place more than this in Tahoe city. It's a beach so it's free and I can spend hours here just laying or walking around it. It offers a great view and one of the most cleanest beach that I have been so far. Kids friendly but I don't remember seeing any dogs though. 2 mins away from the beach, they organize Farmer's market every Thursday, which is an added bonus. Not very crowded, you would only see families and very safe vibe. For instance, I left my stuff unattended and found it exactly where I left."

I'm excited to continue my research to see if I have family here and to return to view the rest of the cemetery.",

A lot of beautiful stonework and some interesting bits of history. They have a little historical pamphlet, it's a bit sparse on details, but over all the visit was well worth it.",
   "It was very exciting to see all the old gravestones and walk through and just filled the history around you. When they close they mean they close. We were run out of their I guess by the caretaker right at 5 o'clock on the nose but all in all it was a good time period",
   "If you visit Virginia City NV and have the time you should visit the cemetery. It is very interesting looking at the old tombstones of the residents from long ago. There generally are will horses roaming in the area also",

   "One of the best resorts in Tahoe. They do an amazing job with events and the programing in the village. Aaron Tippet the events manager is a top notch human. Love working with him. They have music and fireworks every Saturday. Also Laser tubing. Not to mention the skiing and boarding is world class. Eat at one of the many restaurants in the village, my favorite is the Nectar spot, the wraps are DELICIOUS. Be sure to take a ride in the tram and head up to high camp. While you're there check out the Olympic museum or grab some food.",
   "Great skiing at Squaw valley! Beautiful mountain, lots of parking, tons of shops, restaurants a d bars at the base. Add to that a giant mountain with a wide range of skiing choices from pleasant groomed cruising to crazy steep, through the trees powder skiing. Nice lifts and gondolas. Well maintained and clean. A+ experience!",
   "There wasn't a ton of snow, but Squaw was still a blast. The runs are super fun and well maintained. There's a wide range of accessibility from easy to super challenging. Also, everyone working there was super friendly, from Ski patrol, to information, to the lift operators. I feel like it's a little confusing to find the entrance from the main ski lot, but if you just keep trekking through the village, you'll find the base. Can't wait to come back when there's fresh snow and I can hit the trees!",
   "This is one of my favorite resorts in Tahoe. They have a ton of variety in their runs and it's a big resort so I can come multiple days in a row and not do the same runs over and over. If you haven't tried the cookies it's definitely a must for the end of a long snow day!",
   "Squaw is huge! It's great for all skill levels. I go on blues and there were super long stretches with pretty short lines at the lifts. I also have beginner and advanced level friends who all enjoyed the resort. Squaw village also feels very cozy."

My husband spotted a restroom and used it, but was accosted (at length) by a woman working for the church after doing so. It made a poor impression at the very least.",

The locals are somewhat tolerant of our sporadic drop-ins. \n\nMy father has a cabin here so I think we are supposed to get some kind of local discount but it never pans out which is annoying. We usually buy a family pass for the week which is super reasonable.\n\nI love the basketball court and shooting around before I lift weights. \n\nThe warm indoor pool for laps and fooling around with the kids is a great way to get out of a snowbound cabin and get some fun family exercise. \n\nI\u2019m always perplexed at well funded fitness facilities of this size that have a tiny weight area and don\u2019t have barbells. The facility is huge but they cram the hamster wheels and weights into a closet sized area. It\u2019s a 1970\u2019s health club model. The cardio/weight room is the most utilized area but it gets the least space. The entrance lobby is bigger than the gym. It would be nice to get with the times and trends and expand this space to accommodate the demand.",

Not only is it well laid out with just about anything and everything you could want for exercise it was sparkling clean with nice lounging areas. The staff was amazing. Kathy gladly  answered all my questions and pointed out some helpful literature to take with me.

The amount of effort they put into the authentic decor is amazing. They even have fresh rose pedals in the water they same way you will fins it in Thailand. But consider their location is in remote Carson city!\n\nFood is in very good quality and fresh within a large collection, unlike other mediocre Thai restaurants.",

Just the exact right balance of sweet and salty and spicy, you can tell the chef really puts love into everything.

However, we were left disappointed,  my wife's steak was rare, but ordered as med-well. My steak tasted like it fell on the charcoal and was then dunked in crisco. Neither of us finished our steaks, or anything else on the plate., my rice pilaf was under cooked with crunchy pieces of rice. The baked potato was poor, I have had better baked potatoes from Wendy's.  The onion rings were okay, they would have been great except for the excess oil, way to greasy. We left and went home hungry. At over $100 for 2 dinners and 1 Margarita & 1 soda. I would say save your $....\n\nI just read the \"response from the owner\" Wow, my name is not Darren - not hard to see that in the original post. That helps to show the attention to detail that is lacking here. After talking with several friends I have been informed that this is actually very common, apparently the quality of the food is either off the charts awesome - or off the charts poor. We know what my experience was, I hope others experiences are better.",

   "Great food, great drinks and great atmosphere - loved all the items hanging on the walls and from the ceilings - we happened to visit on a Saturday night and there was a magician visiting tables doing card tricks - very entertaining . . . Definitely recommend the smoked prime rib (a Saturday night dinner special) and rib eye with the rib rub and teriyaki butter! . . . And if you like beer, 101 to choose from! \ud83c\udf7a",
   "Shepherd is amazing. Loved him. $1 ribs on monday is also pretty cool considering the normal price of a rack. Huge and pretty great selection of beer on tap and TVs to watch games.",
   "Great food, friendly staff. I had the smoked prime rib Saturday special. It was wonderful! Garlic mashed potatoes, yummy. Fresh veggies looked perfectly.",
   "Best place to eat for dinner, hands down. Employees are super nice and well trained, food is good, amazing interior design. I have no problems at all! You must go to this place!",
   "While the food is good, they have a policy trying to force you to sit in the bar. When you come in they will tell you there\u2019s a wait in the restaurant side but your welcome to sit the bar. They did this to us today even though there was only one table full in the restaurant and all the other tables were empty. The staff then said it\u2019s \u201cour policy to keep people from sitting in the restaurant so we don\u2019t get to full\u201d this is HORRIBLE and unacceptable customer service. How about I help you stay empty by leaving this review and keeping my family out of your restaurant. Some people don\u2019t want to be forced to go to a bar!"

   "The Cracker Box is one of the best breakfast places in the area. Their food is fresh, comes in generous proportions, and they have a wide selection of menu options. They even have fresh squeezed juice. They have great cooks who will cook to order. The wait staff is always friendly, they all help each other out, and everyone is happy to help! CASH ONLY, so be prepared. Their service is always tops. The owner is usually out there helping in the restaurant. It is an authentic diner and a nice place to see familiar faces.",
   "Great old time food! The biscuits and gravy could sustain a platoon for a week. The BLT on Sourdough had plenty of bacon and lots of mayo, delicious. Staff was friendly and there was a welcoming sncse to the whole place. We went out of our way from Mammoth to Reno to stop and enjoy.",
   "This is a very cool little American food joint. The service was good. The food was great and the griddle is right out by the bar so you can watch the boys whip up some of the best eggs and hash browns out there. Would recommend.",
   "Always a must when we visit our Son in Dayton Nevada, we stay in Carson City and it is close to where we stay at, The Craker Box continues to serve great sized meals that are always delicious! I had the patty melt well 1/4 of it and some French fries cooked perfectly but as usual I got full and couldn't eat it all \ud83e\udd17 I shared! The husband had a chili size with cheese and onions, it was also delicious the chili is very good and the hamburger very tasty you can tell it is fresh hamburger meat! A big plus!! We had ranch on the side for our fries put tapatio in mine like it a little spicy. This place is a must for your visit they do not disappoint\u2763We go every time and will continue to do so.... Enjoy",
   "A really cute little diner. The wait staff are very friendly. The food is good portions, cheap and delicious. I had the flapjacks with sausage."

   "Heidi's was a cozy little place to eat. The wait staff was nice. They checked on us, but not so much it was annoying.\nThe food was good, and we did not have a long wait for it. I had the meat lovers omelette. Loads of bacon sausage and ham in it with cheese, I chose to have it with a biscuit and home fries. Omelette was perfect. The biscuit was pretty tasty, not bland and dry like at a lot of places. The home fries were done just right.\nIt seemed like Heidi's was the breakfast place frequented by a lot of retirees. (Nothing wrong with that. They get to try more places being retired) what I liked was that I saw a few couples come in, and noticed that the waitress knew their names.",
   "One of our go to breakfast places in Carson City with a large menu offering from breakfast skillets, benedicts to crepes and most everything you could imagine for breakfast - just take a look at the fantabulous menu.  Located on the corner of Hwy 50 (William Street) and N. Carson Street with a small parking lot.  This cozy little breakfast and lunch establishment is well worth stopping in for a quick bite and great service.\n\nA few of our favorite dishes include the Emerald Bay Skillet with potatoes, mushrooms, bacon, diced avocado, feta cheese and two over medium eggs plus choice of toast or house-made biscuit which we generally lean towards the biscuits and the skillet is deLISH!!  Chicken Egg White Scramble with broccoli, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese and a side of cottage cheese ~ OMTASTY goodness!! How about Four Pancakes and scrambled eggs with ham FOR THE WIN! why not try one of these Traditional Eggs Benedict or the Oscar Benedict both with potatoes and house-made sauce ~ yummilicious goodness!!  Service is always friendly and food is deLISH!  We recommend Heidi's for a tasty breakfasts spot.",
   "The staff at Heidi's Family Restaurant are super nice and accommodating to this out-of-town visitor for the day.  If work beings me out this way of Carson City, Nevada in the future, will be sure to try other items on their menu.  Today's visit for Breakfast, I felt the want of just the basic breakfast and that would be the Pancake Sandwich (2- Fluffy but thick Pancakes, 2 Eggs (Any style) and a choice on 2-Bacons or 2-Sausages.  I ordered a side of Home Fries (just cubed Fried Potatoes) as well.  \n\nMy pancakes were filling and soft and fluffy. The Bacon was crisp and crunchy, not burned... the scrambled Eggs were fluffy and perfectly cooked (unlike some restaurant chains that serve scrambled eggs with a watery look to them).  The side of Home Fries was what I really needed to make the Breakfast complete.   I officially give Heidi's Family Restaurant a 5 Stars rating and highly recommend to visit again and again.....  I can hardly wait!!!!",
   "Vegetarian options available without requiring customization. This is a high-value detail. Being able to order a veggie benedict straight from the menu makes the a big winner for having the conscientiousness and willingness to serve a diversity with delight. Creative pancakes, waffles and carries has my curiosity as return visits are likely.",
   "Small and cozy place. Ate chicken fajitas omlete. Wasn't the best but wasn't bad either. Fruits were fresh. Coffee and service was good"

Unlike most other casino restaurants in town, no smoky atmosphere either. The prices are a little higher than other casino restaurants, but the food and air quality definitely made it worthwhile. Thanks guys!",

   "We're locals and we pretty much go every weekend, we sure do enjoy the food. They are usually busy and sometimes have a wait, but its worth it. The Staff could be more friendlier and should slow down while they are taking your order or when they are being asked for other things."

   "It was just a few short weeks ago that I wrote a review for an Italian restaurant in Buffalo New York, giving it 5 stars and stating that it was the best Italian food I had ever eaten anywhere. I'm here to tell you that Garibaldi's blows that place away. I had the traditional spaghetti and meatballs and it was amazing. The sauce was very authentic and I loved the garlic that they used in the sauce. The meatballs were huge and delicious. My wife got a chicken dish, I can't remember the name of it, but it was made with some kind of lemon marinade and baked. That was equally amazing. On top of all that, the service was excellent, quick and friendly. you are missing out if you don't go to Garibaldi's for a great Italian meal.",

   "For my first time here, I ordered 50B off the menu. Food came out very quickly. It looked great but had very little flavor. Table service was below average and the employees weren't friendly. Not a positive experience for me.",
   "Holy Pholy this place is good!\n\nThis was the best and most fresh Pho I've eaten in my life, not joking.  I had to personally tell the owner how I felt about my meal when I left.\n\nI had just finished a half marathon in Tahoe and was ravenous.  My body must have been craving a big bowl of warm comfort but since I had carbo-loaded the night before, I omitted the noodles and asked for only veggies, shrimp, and chicken in broth.  We ordered the shrimp spring rolls and pork crispy rolls which were also the best I have had.  I can't reiterate enough how fresh everything was.  \n\nI must mention the vegetables in my Pho were so perfectly cooked and bright in color, the chicken was all white meat and extremely tender, and the shrimp melted in my mouth.  The broth was nowhere near \"too salty\" and only tasted flavorful, I drank every last drop.\n\nAlready looking forward to ordering the same exact thing next time I drive through Carson.",
   "Quick service and fresh food. Nice quaint place; would not recommend going during the busy times.",
   "In this case you\u2019re better off getting microwave Chinese from frozen section at grocer. No sarcasm. Note that other reviews mention absence of flavor. I wouldn\u2019t post this if it wasn\u2019t honest.",
   "Our first visit to Pho Country and it was fantastic in every way possible. \n\nWe were seated quickly in this busy restaurant. We ordered two bowls of bun nuoc (beef flank noodle soup), one bun vermicelli noodle bowl and a calimari appetizer. The appetizer was served immediately: crisp, well seasoned, and our son who hates seafood loved this with the lightly sauteed onions. (I'd have eaten just these onions for dinner!!!).\n\nService was quick and friendly. Prices are extremely reasonable, especially for the very generous portions. We'd have eaten more if our stomachs could have held it. \n\nNext time we visit Carson City, this is a restaurant we'll easily eat at once again!"

Can't believe i almost left a tip.",
   "The pork chow mein is ridiculously good. Like, wow, easily the best we have had in Carson. \n\nI already have a favorite Chinese place here in Carson, but I still like to try other restaurants just in case. We typically order pork chow mein and Mongolian beef at each restaurant, and my husband tries something random each time. \n\nI've already mentioned how good the chow mein was, seriously, so good. The Mongolian beef on the other hand was, not great. Not spicy even though there was a chili next to it on the menu, no sweetness, not savory, and had a slight hint of fish flavor (which is my big no no for Mongolian beef). So if Mongolian beef if your thing, like it is mine, this isn't your restaurant. My husband ordered the garlic chicken cause it was supposed to be spicy, also wasn't spicy. \n\nWe ordered these items for take out.",
   "Went there to have lunch to go.  I ordered sweet and sour shrimps. It was an ugly experience when I got home to eat.  The shrimps had been cooked in a heavy red sauce, probably with MSG preservative.  The  shrimps were so hard it was obvious that they were cooked a day or two before today and kept to use them when needed. My lunch ended up in the garbage.  No need to ever return to this place. That\u2019s too bad because Carson City can use a good quality Chinese restaurant.",

   "Came here to have dinner with my family. Stood in line for 20 minutes and nobody walked up or greeted us. The \"chefs\" at the time just stood there and stared while they looked at each other in confusion. \n\nAs we waited, we can hear the bussers talking and asking here the cashier is to get us seated. Few minutes after, we see a woman walk towards us like nothing happened. No greeting whatsoever and just asked how many people and proceeded to charge us. \n\nWhen we got seated, we rushed to the food only to find old food. Everything I picked and tasted stale and disgusting. We came here only for the AYCE and the reviews. Obviously customers reviewing and giving 3+ stars were either drunk or had no other choice of food options. \n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone!",

   "This is place to get sushi in Carson City.  Decor is beautiful and you are seated right away.  Tables are close together is the only criticism I can think of for this place.  You can watch the chefs working and request things that they make pretty much immediately and serve you, so you can be in and out of this restaurant very quickly if you wanted to.  I have eaten here many times and always enjoyed their fresh dishes.  It is a nice dining experience overall, so if you like sushi you should check it out.  Prices are not bad either considering.",
   "Its excellent. However this time their fish was cut thinner and more rice was added, so it was difficult to even taste the fish",
   "Amazing service and amazing food! They were busy as expected for Valentine's day but the staff was so efficient and quick to get our orders out we barely even noticed, as always Kei was amazing \ud83d\ude0a",
   "Worst service ever! Asked for water 3 times before I got any, we were there for an hour before everyone got served a roll each. My boyfriend asked for a specialty drink and they gave it to him in a sampler glass instead of a full sized glass. We were with 6 other people so  we split the check and they add gratuity which was okay except we didn't even do the all you can eat, we each got one roll each and I am pretty sure the added 18 percent is for the all you can eat menu. My boyfriend and I left first and they told the rest of the party we didn't tip so they added our 18 percent to their bill when they had already added it to ours. It seemed they were so busy and nobody in the restaurant had food on their table and we had to ask for our check 3 time .  Worst sushi experience I have ever had as far as service but the food was pretty good.",

Other than that it's awesome.",

   "Great food, excellent service, and a good value. Their spring roll is delicious!  I missed a fortune cookie though! They give you almond cookies.",
   "Hands down the best Chinese food I've had in the area. Great portions, great prices, clean food. This is definitely my favorite Chinese place now. The staff is always friendly, it's clean inside and out and also has a drive thru."

   "I used to love coming to this location and always referred friends and family here, but a few weeks ago I purchased their \"love salad\" and yes it was probably my favorite salad but I had an allergic reaction to something in it and when I went to talk to the manager about what ingredients were in the salad (not accusing anyone of anything) and was scolded by the manager for doing so. He was 100% positive that something like that would never happen as his restaurant! I was disappointed with how he handled it."

So if you are into that they have them! I felt like we were the youngest people there and we are late 40s. It was VERY loud and noisy though coming from the other patrons so we were sure to leave before the live music started and it got any louder. I am not a boring ol' bitty by any means but, it was just a bit much when you are trying to relax and enjoy your dinner and have a conversation that's all I mean. The owner's father was there, forgive me I have a horrible memory, and he was awesome and so was our waitress. Maybe one day we will make it back in again...",

Husband loved the Frank's Wings and the 3 Little Pig pizza was very good. We do date night every week even with the pandemic, and I have to say this was the best food we have had in a LONG time! \n\nWe will be back! Thank you for giving us this option for take out!",
   "The Union in Carson City, Nevada is a great place for a fun, laid back dinner. They serve their own beers plus other popular beers from area breweries. The food is fantastic! The soups are all in house creations using locally sourced ingredients. The burgers are made with locally raised beef. When you are given the choice between soup or fries, GET THE SOUP!",
   "Everything here is freshly made, even down to the sauces. Expect a fresh spin on the classic ranch, ketchup and other classic sauces that you normally associate the flavor. Most of the food items I have tried have had unique and delicious flavor. You wont find flavor like this anywhere else in town. I was really in the mood for fries and their fries were beautifully spiced with a subtle hint of garlic and herbs. \n\nOur waiter, Kelson, was on top of it. He made our experience relaxed and took care of us when necessary. \n\nMy boyfriend liked the beer, but wishes the menu more clearly defined if a beer was amber, blonde etc. The first blonde he ordered was really rather dark. \n\nOverall great beer, great food, great atmosphere. Good casual, laid back place. They also had some games on, which I quite enjoyed. It gave it a classy sports bar type of feel.",

A lot of other places serve really bland, mild salsa, but this one had some kick!! They also serve a bean dip to go with your chips, which I love. The food is yummy and you aren't left waiting for service. They have good lunch specials!!",

I ordered a small engineer sandwich, chicken and noodle soup, and a small drink.\nThe cashier missed my order for the chicken noodle soup, and when my food was brought to me I asked about the soup and they looked at my receipt and even though I did not order it, they were more than happy to correct my lunch. Your line I was also informed that sometime this summer. I really hope so, as my experience in Carson City was awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone, not only because of the food, but they also help support the fire department in different areas.",

   "Firehouse subs is a wholesome establishment. They support a great cause, with some great sandwiches to back it up. I enjoy Italian sub sandwiches, but they offer a great variety of quick and quality meals. \n\nMy only complaint is that they don't have a buffet style sandwich building line like subway or port of subs. \n\nOh, the salsa is also fantastic.",
   "This was the 2nd time I ate here.The roast beef and cheese sandwiches are delicious.  Great ,fun atmosphere , fast service and friendly service. They heat the sandwiches and that makes the bread soft and the sandwich better than most .",
   "My first Firehouse Subs experience was a huge hit.  Service was fast, food was hot and tasty and the employees were nice.  The restaurant was clean and the TVs were in convenient locations.  Definitely looking to hit up more Firehouse Subs in the future."

She was funny, sweet, and personable.  She added the perfect ending to a long work day. Olive Garden has an amazing asset in Stacey as any company would be lucky to have her as a server. We felt lucky as guests. Plus the food was great to boot and everyone else was friendly as well. We will be back and hope to have her again. Plus we will toss in a good word to our colleagues who stop to work in the area!",

One of which is hot and one of which is refrigerated for later that day or the next day.   The second meal was free it\u2019s a buy one get one free deal.  My hot meal was so large it actually lasted me for two days plus the free meal. So  I have had three amazing dinners thanks that they\u2019re doing this service.  Amazing!!   Thanks.",
   "Olive Garden is definitely high up on my list. Every meal that I've tried from there is delicious one way or another. The soups are very delicious as well and are unlimited, as are the salads. Service isn't the best, but not the worst either. Definitely recommend this restaurant."

   "Food was absolutely amazing! Now the service \ud83e\udd14 we walked in and it was so nice and cozy and the waitress was not in the conversations mood. My husband kept complimenting the restaurant and the waitress just had this blank stare and I thought maybe it\u2019s the end of the night so it\u2019s fine. A few moments later a couple that is the same race as her sat down and I felt like they got a whole different waitress. I immediately saw the difference as she was standing right by them giving telling them how they run their business (when they didn\u2019t even ask). Anyway she didn\u2019t give us refills or check on us until we asked for the check (tip time) then it was oh anything else I can get you. Well we\u2019re already ready to go so no. It really sucked because we were looking for a good legit high quality place and I guess we didn\u2019t find it. It would have been completely fine if she wouldn\u2019t have given outstanding service to the very next couple after giving us a cold shoulder. I definitely recommend if you are the same race as the waitress but not for anyone else lol. Don\u2019t know what else it could have been \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

But it was removed. Seems like Google doesn't post honest reviews because they aren't highly rated. I've ate here many times. The last 3 times, it's been terrible. Burned, toppings are lacking and pizza has no flavor. Before the last 3 times, it was great. Best in town by far. Everyone has bad days but 3 times in a row!?  I don't know if I'll try it again. The last time, I'd rather have bought pizza from the guy with the orange toga."

Neither the waitress nor the manager who both knew that I was not happy with the garbage food they served me offered any discount on my $13 hot dog. Weird place, never returning.",
   "What a phenomenal menu! Incredibly creative small plates. Though priced a bit high, it's a great, fun time trying new combinations of dishes. We LOVED the crawfish mac 'n cheese, and they did not skimp on the crawfish! The shrimp po' boy was LOADED. The espresso braised brisket over a bed of risotto was, shockingly, bland; perhaps a stronger taste in the glaze, or more seasoning on the brisket? The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable."

I ordered six piece shrimp so that we could have it over $25 for delivery and they were cooked to death and hard as a rock and I couldn\u2019t even taste the shrimp. I doubt we will try them out again.",

   "The food is great and they vary the selection from day to day.",
   "The service was great. That is so important. The problem was just is they had no dishes except one desert that weren't super spicy and plain rice. I've eaten at Indian restaurants before and always been able to find something to eat that wasn't too spicy. We were there for a birthday celebration so I had no choice but to stay.",
   "Arrived at 1:30 p.m. right before they closed down the buffet. I have been to tons of Indian food buffets but I must admit, all of the food was fresh and delicious. The butter chicken and tandoori dishes were delectable,  \nAs well as the lentil and cabbage dishes.The mango lassie drinks  were superb.",
   "I came here about 5 months ago when I was in town for work. Came back today to try the lunch buffet. Service was just as great as the first time and the food hasn't changed a bit either. I highly recommend this place. Great food wonderful service."

They also gave me only half of a little sauce cup of dressing. Very disappointing.",

Pasta is house made and fresh - it is AMAZING! Pasta dishes are large enough for 2-3 people. Delish salads and appetizers. The house red is $7/glass and wonderful with food. I wish this place was in Denver. I\u2019d eat there several times a week.",
   "Went for lunch. Pricey food. The house made meatballs in the sandwich were bland. Not enough sauce either. The soup was \u201cwarm\u201d and the beans were hard (undercooked).  The Caesar salad did not have enough dressing. Another guest had Italian dressing on a salad which was wonderful. The reason for 2 stars.  There were 9 of us for lunch and the consensus was just OK but pricey.   I don\u2019t think I will return."

Bella Vita Bistro never, I repeat never disappoints when it comes to service with a smile along with delicious food and drinks.  Whether you choose one of their House Specialties or the Special of the Day you will be veryyyy happy!  \n\nWe LOVE the little details of when we come in to eat that you are greeted with a bottle/carafe of water for the table along with house-made potato chips and parmesan garlic aioli dip that are absolutely deLISH!!\n\nSOOO happy that they are open for dinner again with their full regular menu available along with an extended after 4pm menu anddd be sure to look for Daily Specials.  We LOVE the Pasta Specials and the Steamed Clams are TOO DIE FOR!!  Have to mention their Weekly Specials like Ladies and Guys night for different yummilicious Martinis and Smoked Whiskey Cocktails.  The Heirloom Bruschetta was absolutely deLISH with the Hot Truffle Pub Cheddar Cheese Dip with Pretzel bites and Baguette slices just being the OMCheesy goodness that I was craving!!\n\nLunch is ALWAYS quick for a meet-up during the week whether with a co-worker, friend or my hubby to grab my go-to of either the Big Bird Sandwich or Pear Gorgonzola Salad both are yummilicious!!\n\nLook forward to popping in to Bella Vita to check out Friday Night Live Music and to nosh on another OMTASTY meal.",

   "I was honestly very skeptical about trying Chinese food in Carson City, NV. Having lived close to Houston most of my life, I'm no stranger to good Chinese food. \n\nThis place serves pretty good food. \n\nTheir chicken items were perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Their hot and sour soup was good. \n\nNote: things that are labeled spicy aren't that spicy. I added chili sauce (ask for it), which gave my food some good heat. \n\nI would definitely eat here again.",
   "Very good food, polite workers who let you eat in peace. Very cold temperature wise which left the last bit of my food cold. The will do no eggs in fried rice on request. The ambiance and mood feel relaxed some of the music was to energetic for the setting.",
   "This was a great lunch date! The host/server was exceptional! He recommended the daily special, and it was superb! He was attentive but not overbearing. He asked how we liked the food, to which we said it was great, he then told the cooks in the back who then thanked us for coming in and and were very appreciative for the feedback. We will be returning. They have new new owners so give them a shot if you haven't been to Panda Kitchen in a while.",
   "Pleasantly surprised to get all homemade food here. The soup was amazing!  Dont order more than one type of brown sauce chicken at once, as ours all came out the same. Still dying to try the general chicken! We ordered general and orange, and sweet and sour chicken, and all basically came out as the same dish, but that dish was excellent. Will happily go again and try again haha. Not the best service, but the food more than makes up for that. Server was very nice, just not efficient."

With it being my first visit, I had a hard time contemplating what to order. Your have a choice of your basic breakfast options, or your basic lunch options. The place is clean and the staff are friendly. -Regina",
   "Slow service but the food more than makes up for it. The waitresses are very nice though.\nGood specials are great very good pricing. Lots of bang for your buck.\nNice place very cozy place\nIce cream specialized coffee that they serve. I went for breakfast but noticed they do these 2 things though.",
   "This place is awesome, love all the pictures and old original art. Food is really good and the portions perfect, not much and not to little. Just right in my book.",
   "Very good breakfast and the coffee was surprisingly rich. Not like the usual brown water served at most diners.\nThe price was a little on the high side for Reno/Carson but worth it.",
   "I love a good diner!"
