The two young ladies are very friendly and it appears they accept cash only. Their food truck is located on the same property as the Mobil gas station.  They are open for breakfast and I'm not sure what time they leave. I will investigate further.",

Make sure you check your food before you leave. Not only could you have to ask for a non-rock like bagel, you might get the wrong food.\n\nIn the past the food was better but there was a manager or owner that would yell and complain about his staff infront of customers. Several times at the drive through, he would yell at someone and then look at me and say \"Can you believe them? There so lazy!.\" Not good... Not good...",

  "Super-long wait at the drive-through, even @2:30.  Chicken was good and hot, had to wait about five minutes after we paid.  The mushrooms were soggy & lukewarm, as were the Tater Chips.  So chicken was good, sides not so much.",
  "I've never had a bad meal here; from the tender dinners, to the sandwiches or salads, the food is always de6and made to order.  I just wish it were easier to find a cleaner table.  I often wind up having to clean the table off before sitting down.",
  "Chicken finders are good and love the Zax sauce. Had my first sandwich there and the chicken was tough, flat, and more breaded than meat. And the prices are decent.",
  "I freaking move this place. Service is top notch. You always get your food quick restrooms clean soda machines clean tea fresh food always hot and tasty. There is legit nothing bad for me to say. I eat here at least 2 times per week.",
  "First visit, definitely fast food but slightly upscale. Store was clean and servers are very helpful. Zalads are quite large but served in large plates not paper or styrofoam, nice! Chicken club sandwich was quite tasty. I will visit there again."

  "I love baskin Robbins, but this location is horrible. They never have enough product. So my issue today is I had my fianc\u00e9 go in to purchase me to of the pre-packed quarts of the mint chocolate chip, no problem. That was on a Thursday. Two days later on Saturday I get the ice cream out and notice a blue sticky substance on the seal of the container. I open it and the container is filled with a blue frozen substance.(mint chocolate chip is green) I immediately check the expiration date and it was good. I open the other container and find the same exact thing. Both containers also had a chemical smell. I called the store to tell them what I found in the containers and asked if I could receive a refund. I was told due to the covid-19 pandemic that they could not take it back so I asked to be refunded and was told I could not get a refund.  I ask for a manager and the owner of this specific location and was told I couldn\u2019t have this information. I emailed corporate and am waiting to hear back. If I don\u2019t get a response I am going to contact the local health department and the better business bureau and inform them of the service I received. I took photos of both containers and will be submitting them as well.",
  "Service is horrible got a crew of lazy employees who will rudely tell you they are out of everything you ask  for just to stop in and see they actually have it inside. Had the pleasure of dealing with shannon multiple times and each time she was the same and honestly rude about taking an order, cutting off because they were in the middle of conversations and we had to repeat our order twice back ...news flash we can hear everything in drive thru and this used to be my go to ...womt anymore the whole place is just disgraceful...summers is horrible but atleast they get your coffee and orders right",
  "I'm sure the help are nice people. But the hot fudge sundae was awful. First I ordered a 2 scoop. A scoop should be a real Full scoop. Not 2 ribbon strips. ? Do you want whip cream ? Yes..... I receive a cup with the 2 ribbons whip cream with 5 stripes of burnt hot fudge. I asked about the cherry..... Oh we are out of cherries.   $5 wasted. I had to drink water too remove the taste. How about training employee to care."

  "Delicious food, although a straight vegetarian option for their bowls would be nice. Their ingredients are fresh and their sauces are tasty. They also have adorable and yummy pastries made by an in-house pastry chef. I have never liked fried plantains until now! We have only done takeout so far, but their dining room is beautiful with lots of ambiance and art. Awesome to be able to frequent and support a local restaurant.",

There is an open field once used for football, but it has been allowed to become overgrown.  A nice creek meanders thought the park and is adjacent to the picnic area and child playground.  The County park has become a little worn down, but you will enjoy it!",
  "Nice and well kept park... About 1/2-mile hard top hiking trail... Has basketball court and a small playground for young children... River looks dirty and contaminated by some type of red polution...",
  "The park seems to be ok. Nothing exciting. Play area is very limited and is in direct sunlight. Lots of open space though and a small walking trail.. good for riding bike. Only one picnic shelter and that's just at the start of the park... Is not maintained and grass is not trimmed.",
  "Cool park with playground and basketball courts, also there is a bridge that overlooks a small riverbend with shallow water",
  "We love this park! If you follow the trail to the back there are basketball courts and fields to play baseball or football in. It has a bridge with a beautiful stream also."
