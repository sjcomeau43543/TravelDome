   "It is absolutely stunning museum with so much history in it. I am amazed with all the exhibitions and details that you can find there. Whole history of New York , old trains , cars , fire trucks , centuries of cultural development all in one place. Highly recommend for the whole family or to anyone really- true highlight of the Albany City . Best of all - it\u2019s free of charge ( donation is appreciated). 5 stars",
   "From childhood to adulthood and across many states this museum has remained a favorite of mine.  The main floor exhibits have always been such a great way to learn about the NY environment and history.  I have always loved the adirondack displays and also the parts about metro life.  The Native American area is amazing.  This museum continues to bring learning to life and remind me of my roots a I have lived in Baltimore MD for almost 20 years now. The love of it has moved on to my children and we will continue to visit in the future.",
   "Lots of exhibits to see. Nicely organized. Poignant 9/11 exhibit. Excellent local animal exhibit as well as locally discovered mastodon and whale skeletons. Minerals and NYC historical sections also interesting.",
   "Gem show! Had a lot of fun. Harlem Display is a great educational tool. Just a relaxing place to be on a lazy Sunday. Good parking. And the Carousel!!!",
   "So we love it. It's a beautiful museum really clean awesome things to look at and explore. Only concern is my son is almost 5 I'm not sure how kid friendly it is. There is a kids part but it's pretty small"

   "If you\u2019re visiting the area, it\u2019s well worth checking out the capitol building. The craftsmanship and history of this building is pretty amazing. Photographs don\u2019t do it justice. You need to see this with your own eyes. The detail in the stone carvings is a must see. The concourse that runs below the area is also pretty cool. You can stop in Logan\u2019s and get a delicious sandwich while you\u2019re there.",
   "Lots of amazing details went into the capitol building. It is a good architectural visit and see how the various architects created their vision over the very long time it took to build the capitol. Do the guided tour and also do the self-tour to get the most out of your visit there. There are so many things to look at and discover, plan to be there for at least 4 hours to discover as much as possible.",
   "How to rate this place? It holds some of the most courageous, dedicated, selfless people... But then it also holds some of the most disgusting, corrupt, and greedy.\n\n There is a cool museum inside though, and the Million Dollar Staircase is impressive.",
   "Beautiful historic place where State legislators come together to create legislation that governs our ways of life and social construct. It's an incredibly breathtaking architectural place worth visiting.",
   "We went on a weekday tour. It was just after a large High School group, and the guide took care to avoid them and the noise that came with them. Our group was just a few folks, so made for a very relaxed and quiet experience that encouraged observation and learning. We saw a good portion of the building and also lingered afterward to poke into a few spots we passed earlier for a closer look. There are lots of inconsistencies in the story of the Capitol's construction that prompt questions these days. Such as, how is it possible to be 8 million dollars over budget (total spent $12mil) after spending the initial 4mil, before the governor \"notices\"? Why did nobody \"notice\" after the project was $1mil over budget? How is it possible to lose a huge portion of historical records in a fire which specifically targeted the library, with a single victim who did not make it out? Weren't there fire safety precautions in place in case of such event? Was the fire an accident? How can you leave just a few stone carving elements unfinished, becoming an instant eye sore and looking embarrassing in the most important Chambers of the building, while the carvings on the staircases are finished? How can you make ceiling decoration out of paper when you know the roof leaks and you've got buckets on the floor to catch the water? Why install giant non-working fireplaces, when you know you need to heat the building in winter, so could use real working ones? There are still lots of questions to ponder and research, and the tour is just the beginning."

   "John was our tour guide! Very knowledgeable and genuinely answered all of our questions enthusiastically. It truly is a hidden gem located in the heart of Downtown Albany : only 2 of these ships remain in the world, the one in Albany being the only one afloat, the other one in Galveston being on land. It felt like we were back in 1945 while touring this museum. I hope they keep the museum as it is as it represents an important part of our history.",
   "Phenomenal vessel, important ongoing mission, could not be a more dedicated group to care for her. Amazing to see her further restoration since my visit 17 years ago. Here are some shots from 2003. Keep up the great work. Long live Destroyer Escort USS Slater.",
   "This was a really cool land (or rather water) mark when we saw it. The tours were informative, captivating and well-incorporated the restored elements of the ship. Some of the restorations are really impressive - the size of the guns on top are quite shocking in-person. Our guide was friendly and went above and beyond to answer our questions after the tour was done. This was a really cool element of our trip to Albany.",
   "Awesome piece of history. The last floating destroyer in its class. Terrific guided visit that show the rough leaving quarter on board and the state of the art technology for ww2. Guides are passionate. The tour is fast pace and enjoyable and brings tons of interesting anecdotes. Definitively a good visit!",
   "Visited Albany to see friend from Detroit. It\u2019s Friday afternoon and tour was conducted in small group. I love history and knew bit about WW2. However, It was first time I got to know the life of Sailors inside the ship during the war. Our guide was excellent and we learned so much. I\u2019m not sure how I felt.... it was hard to imagine what young people went through... Must have been very steep learning environment for lots of them. Tour is  educational and also you get to relax by the riverside. \nFree parking and easy access to the building. \nDonations will keep going this great piece of history and education. Well recommended. :)"

This day when we were coming back there was no breeze and it was very hot.  The historian, Pat provided interesting stories along the way. My wish was that the cruise could have been longer.",

   "Relaxing boat ride with a bar in the back of the middle level. Shade for all three levels, great PA system for the tour guide. Wish the ride was more scenic than the industrial scenery of Albany. Once we got past this, it was great to see the old mansions and our tour guide spotted a bald eagle in the trees bordering the Hudson.",
   "Very informative cruise....we learned a bit about the history of Albany and got some pictures of American eagles....at 20 bucks each it was good value. The bar had a good selection and the staff was friendly."

   "It was our first time here we will be going every year the day after Christmas as a tradition from now on. The lights were beautiful everything is really well done... The hot chocolate and the crafts inside are awesome also.",
   "It's a fun family car ride with lights where even my littlest one couldn't get enough lights. The vendors are local and have been the staple of a good market to check out after the lights. Now a family tradition when we are visiting home for the holidays.",
   "This was one of the best light shows I've ever seen. It's awesome because the kids can get out of their car seats as you slowly idle around what seems like miles of roads and light displays. many of displays are animated and there's always a new surprise around every corner. this was the first year we went, but we plan to make this a yearly family tradition. The line can be quite long so make sure you bring some entertainment for the kids while you wait. it took us about two and a half hours from the time we arrived until the time we had completed the entire circuit.",
   "Every year the park does an excellent job lighting up the park with beautiful and enjoyable holiday lights. It is great walking through the park at night or driving your car through or running. Our son lives across from the park and the lights are enjoyable from his apartment. Albany does a great job carrying for their parks in general."

We've been to many events: First Friday free (night hours), Schuyler Sisters (best exhibit yet), local Victorian wedding dresses exhibit, Hudson River School exhibit, permanent mummies and ancient Egyptian and many others. Lots of kid activities accompany each visit. Snack bar great. We love this museum.",
   "I was expecting this to be a great museum, I didn't realize how great it would be.  I was blown away by the Hudson River School gallery, totally awestruck.  My kids loved the dioramas.  Mr wife liked the art made from reused materials, like acorns and pistachio shells and tea bags.  Very cool, strongly recommended.",
   "Only one floor was open when I went recently, as exhibitions were being swapped out in the other, but there was still plenty to see (and the admission price was halved due to there being the one less floor) anyhow.\n\nThe flow of the place lends itself well to easy meandering, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the exhibits themselves are well-curated.\n\nAnd at only $10/person for adults, it\u2019d be worth coming a few times a year.",
   "This place is one of the most unsung wonderful places in the city of Albany. It's so well laid out. Very handicap friendly parking and display access. 3 floors of beautiful art work and the history behind many of the pieces is detailed and well written. The Jewel of this summer at the institute is the display of the Hudson River school artists. Painting after wonderful painting presented with an instructive guide provided by the museum, that tells you exactly what each picture is of and who it's by. I found this incredibly helpful. There Egyptian area was surprising. It's nice to know that one doesn't have to go to New York to see an incredible and detailed display on ancient Egyptian culture.\nCome early and plan to spend several hours here. There is a gift shop,of course and a snack bar  that has limited beverages and Rich deserts. But a little thin on healthy snacks and food items. There are displays after interesting displays and one day doesn't seem like enough time to spend at such a rich and enlightening space.",
   "While quite small, the quality of exhibits was quite high, especially considering the size of Albany.  The Louvre it is not, but well worth a trip! The docent at Reception was very knowledgeable about the exhibits and super nice. Bonus, they have their own parking lot around back so you don't have to fight the dreaded downtown Albany parking situation!"

He not only taught us how to throw safely but how to progress each time. He also spiced it up turning into a game really adding to the fun. \nWhether you are doing a date night, a friend's night out or a party we HIGHLY suggest!! We also found out they have leagues which is some thing we are definitely looking into! \nGuys if you are not going here you are missing out 5/5 HIGHLY RECOMMEND \u2665\ufe0f",
   "This place was so great! I went there with my Mom and friend and we had a blast. None of us knew how to throw knives or axes before but our instructor Erick did a really good job. He's an excellent teacher and helped us to improve our technique. He was also very accommodating with scheduling our time.\n\nIt's a really fun activity and I would definitely go back. 10/10 would recommend",
   "A unique place to go to burn some energy! Jess was an awesome teacher for sure. Great memories created and a cool place to tell your friends about!!",
   "FANTASTIC place to go. Incredibly fun, both for kids and adults, safety is the #1 priority, nobody was injured. Axe throwing is very fun and competitive. Don't worry about not being good at it or thinking it'll be heavy, a couple practice throws and the right technique, you'll do great, especially with an instructor like Ashley/Axeley. Can't wait to go back.",
   "This place was so much fun! I can't remember our coaches name, but she definitely helped make the experience even better. She gave us tips and walked us through how to properly and safely throw axes along with hitting the bullseye. We will definitely be going back some time soon!"

   "Hello Katlean is very friendly and accommodating. But I was informed by the day manager adults must be accommodate by a children. It a rules . That I was not offended by . But very disappointed to explore and recommend this Museum. Public to pay 8.00 for cost. While you where enjoy your day. It should be posted on site. Parents did not look offend by present. I even laugh with another mom and boys getting in canoes. Smile laughter. I am confidant mom and grandchildren 7. But mine grew up for this ages group. Toddlers and kindergartners age group perfect. Katlean 10 plus . you have very polite and special.",
   "You can play with everything here! It's so hands on and amazing for kids. Learning never stop nor does the fun! I had more fun than my own kids did!",
   "Nice children's museum, perfect for under age 10 and good for about 2 1/2 hours if you help your children to interact with some of the exhibits. If you just let your kids run through you will be done in half that time. Museum looks a bit worn and the animal area was about 3/4 full and the glass really needed cleaning. Friendly staff and reasonable price.",
   "The children's museum is a very nice place to bring your child between the age of 2 + 9. They have a lot of Hands-On activities and the staff there are very pleasant. You could probably get there through the whole place with your children in an hour and a half.",
   "While all ages can appreciate it, its geared about 10 to 14 year olds. Many exhibits have pretty detailed reading at that age level. Lots of room and not that noisy even on Saturday"

There is also a playground if you have kids that you want to bring to this park.\n\nOverall, the park isn\u2019t all that big but has everything you could ask for from a park. A nice trail, trees, lake, quiet atmosphere, animals, and parking area. If you\u2019re in the Albany area, definitely check this park out. I\u2019ll definitely be back if I\u2019m in the area.",
   "I have been going here since I was a little boy. My grandparents lived two houses in from the pond/lake on Lenox Ave. I remember fishing with my grandpa, skating in the winter, and now I take my kids here. The new playground is nice and the picnic tables are good for bringing a lunch. Glad to have a place like this to come to.",

   "I give this high marks for the passionate volunteers who work at this sweet underfunded museum.  \n\nIt would behoove the City of Albany to caretake the buildings they have left to rot, shame on them.  I think due to the ramshackle quality of the surroundings buildings many tourists  in the area who want to visit  a Shakers community choose instead to visit the Hancock Shaker Village , a living history museum preserved for generations.  The Shaker story is of high interest and tourists want to learn about this communal lifestyle that has few remaining communities.  \n\nI am glad I was able to meet this small but enthusiastic group of knowledgeable and avid Shaker history buffs.",
   "My mom Worked there when I was a child\nAt Ann Lee Nursing home up till the day the moved all the resident's to the New Albany County Nursing home.\nGreat memories going to work with her at both places.\nThe Building is amazing just sad to see it left the way it is \nBut the grounds are amazingly kept and it's beautiful there.\nGhost Hunter's may like to check it out.\nGot some good pics during my day trip.\nAlso visit Ann Lee's Grave. As well as the pond. \nYou will enjoy it.\nBut I love it so much for the memory of my mom and I working her 3 pm to 11 pm shifts.\nMiss those days and her.",
   "Nice educational tour, custodian great, well organized",
   "Great place great people",
   "I know the volunteers her do their vrry best operating this site,  but it is a shame Albany doesn't provide them with adequate budget to maintain the place as it should be. This is the original Shaker site in America and the founder, Ann Lee is buried here. A place of such historic importance deserves far better preservation than this one is getting. Every other Shaker village in the country has a private foundation to see to its upkeep, but this one is owned by the city of Albany and it is starved for the funds it needs. I love the place and visit it frequently, but it is heart-breaking to see many of the buildings needing repair. It would be nice if the volunteers would organize some \"Hands to work, hearts to God\" days, when people from the community could come together to apply fresh paint, make some simple repairs, and so forth. But, back to the review--the museum and gift shop are very good. The orchard and cemetery are worth the short walk, the critters in the barn are fun, and the herb garden is very well maintained. They have a holiday craft fair coming up that lasts four weeks, has some great craft item, at very good prices, which I recommend highly. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful."

   "A nice little getaway for a few hours that\u2019s fun and genuine. Alison and Scott, the owners, are exceptionally nice, and if you have any issue they are more than happy to give you excellent customer service. There\u2019s so much to do, and my family loved visiting and look forward to coming back!\n\nI recommend the go karting, rock climbing, and mini golfing, and if you have little kids then the mini go karts look really fun!",
   "This is a great place for the entire family and includes go-karts, a batting cage, a rock climbing wall, a bungee jumping trampoline, a miniature golf course, bounce house, a motorboat course, a mini go-kart course and the water balloon and also a snack concession stand and there are also multiple other little things to do. This place is a great place to host a birthday party provided it's during the season. The only thing that this place could improve is its cleanliness and maintenance which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars. There was puddles of water in the bounce house and other places and it could have been maintained a little bit better",
   "Certainly not what we were expected. Half of the attractions are in need of maintenance. Our kids wanted to use the bounce house, after we paid for them to go in. They did one round through and stated they did not feel safe because there were so many holes. Go carts were fun, but on a very tiny track. Will not be returning any time soon. Experience was not worth the $30 spent.",
   "Great place for an inexpensive kids party!  Hosted our son's 3rd birthday here last week and everyone had a great time.  The bounce house was too wet because it had rained the night before, so the kids rode mini go-karts instead.  They had a blast!  The mini golf course is one of the more inventive in the area, and there was a lot to do and see to keep a pack of small kids busy.  Will definitely be returning for more early fall fun!",
   "Decent play place to spend a few hours. Not much of a wait while we were there. The only part i didn't care for is when there wasn't a line for an attraction the attendant went to the main check in and had to ask for someone. Good local place for kids."

It was clean and it had multiple visitors in the hour we wandered around, great experience",

It's not very big but there are a bunch of different shows for the planetarium and even a Nasa simulation area.",

The kids had a blast learning from all of the hands on science exhibits and we're excitedly talking about their favorite ones, and what they learned from each of them. It was a full parking lot when we got there but it never once felt overcrowded or chaotic inside. Great place for the family to enjoy an afternoon of fun education and new experiences, highly recommend!!",

Admission isn't very expensive and they sell a lot of useful things to have around the house. They accept both cash and card. You can learn about magnetism and surface tension here. It's excellent for kids and adults alike.",

Small and large dogs mingle together and often get into fights. Children run about the dogs and owners do not pick up after their pets. Use with extreme caution. Our dog has been known to be aggressive there as he gets overwhelmed even under close oversight. Best to go in the middle of the day as mornings and evenings are busiest.",

   "Cutting heritage trees for no reason! We took a walk this morning on the Vlomankill Trail and noticed a lot of random tree cutting was done recently, including some healthy 110 year old white pines. The cutting was done by contract because we saw the crew at work a few weeks ago but the workers were badly directed by the state. Healthy Ash and Hemlocks, well off the trail were clear cut while less healthy trees leaning over the trail were left in place. A bad job!",
   "Great for a hike, a run or a visit of the museum. Great community and festivals. Nice views. Endless trails! Love it!",

My kids love the tall slide and climbing wall at the visitor center, and they can't get enough of the waterfalls. The stairs under the cliffs make for a quick and picturesque workout. Double back when you get back to the top instead of walking the flats back to your car if you want more cardio.",
   "I went when some of the trails were closed, but the park was still enjoyable. I stopped at the overlook view and it was breathe taking! Plenty of parking spots and restrooms all throughout the park. Maps of the grounds are available at the visitors center.",
   "Beautiful views. Nice location for a picnic. Tables, grills and restroom facilities are available on a first come basis.",
   "Just love the view! Better to visit in summer as it\u2019s pretty chilly up there.",
   "Absolutely love this place. It has almost everything you need to have a great day. Hiking, recreation area, picnic tables. All it needs is a swimming area. If you want a day to just relax and enjoy the views, come here. If you want to get a workout and go rock climbing or hiking, come here. So worth the drive and the 6 dollars to park. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a nature getaway."

   "First time there. Loved it. Still so much more exploring to do. Trails seem to average 0.9 to 3 miles but I'm sure you can loop certain ways to make it further.",
   "Among the nature preserve areas in Clifton Park this appears to be the biggest. You can definitely get into some dense woods here along the Mohawk River. The variety of wildlife is great. Do watch out for marshy and muddy places\u2014this is right along a major river after all.",
   "Wasn't thrilled about this place. Lots of power lines along the main entrance and very swampy in the summer. There are also tons of bugs. We did the ferry loop and tall pines. Maybe there are some other good places but here the trails just kind of cut in and out with tons of trail heads for each of these tails. I guess if you live close by it isn't too bad but not worth a long drive to me. The pros are that they are protecting the land so that's good.",
   "One or my favorite places to take a walk with my dog. Will also do some trail running in the summer when it's not so damp. The preserve offers a lot of trail space traveling through the woods.  You will definitely see a lot of birds and may see some other wildlife. The park borders the Mohawk river to one side and a section of the Erie canal on the other. If you like the outdoors and live in Clifton Park this place is a must visit. Very well maintained and clean. Sometimes it gets pretty busy with a lot of people, but only because it's so popular for fishing, dogs, and walking.",

These pictures do not do the place justice; there is a pavilion that explains the history of the American Bald Eagle in the area, the path that goes along the periphery of the island is a good healthy walk that anyone can do, and the interior paths are beautiful, diverse, and you can even visit the site of a very old car wreck. If you are lucky, you might find a guide who will walk with you for a bit, and who can explain the island\u2019s history, wildlife, and more.",

   "Great spot for bringing our pup! We love the trails and the freedom we have when coming here to go on adventures! Highly recommended. They have a great new set up for a playground (in the warmer months) and a fence I dog park too!",
   "This is a wonderful Park only a few miles from where I live it's very spacious and the dog loved it he got along with the other dogs very well and the people were very friendly the only drawback is that you have to pay a fee when other dog parks in the area don't I think we pay enough taxes in this town to cover that",
   "Very nice quiet park even a dog section",
   "Pretty nice park. Love the dog park dogs and their people but the town could do more to maintain the dog park.",

   "Saratoga State Park is one of the best parks in Saratoga. As a runner, it's easy to find various routes with tons of variety to keep you exercise interesting. As a photographer, my couples have always loved going to the park to take their engagement or family portraits. Since the grounds are so expansive, there is no shortage of beautiful places to shoot!\n\nThe park is dog-friendly, so there are always a few pups running around too in the spring and summertime, which I view as a great bonus!",
   "This place is absolutely stunning! There are no words to describe the majestic experience! The park comes alive at night with a nightly colored carousel, beautiful fountains that are something that could come from a fairytale.  Saratoga in general is a beautiful place with some neat history!!!",
   "Gorgeous state park with so much to do! My favorite activity is tasting all the different spring waters. Bring some clean, empty jugs to bring some home. Check out the Roosevelt baths it you've got $40 to spare on a bath. The naturally carbonated tubs are like soaking in warm champagne.",
   "I had been here over ten years ago and only visited areas relevant to the venue at Saratoga, but even then the little I saw was so beautiful and very clean and we'll kept.  This past year I had the luxury of visiting Saratoga Park twice two nights for a concert l, in which you once see very little.  Then had an opportunity to visit a friend's family just south of the park and had a chance to see what else it had to offer, unfortunately this was near the end of fall not an ideal time but still very grateful I was able to see more of the beautifulness the park has to offer.",
   "Saratoga Spa State Park is a beautiful place to relax. The gentle terrain offers picnic areas, shady stream side trails, suitable for the nature-lover or the casual walker, as well as certified running courses used by joggers. There are fountain springs all around the park. The fountains have signs that read that the water has medicinal benefits. I know people from all over the country to enjoy the benefits of the water. I did taste the water and some fountains had an effervescent taste to it while other had a refreshing taste. I highly recommend this park if you\u2019ve never been before."

   "I\u2019ve done escape rooms in Scranton PA, NJ, NYC, Troy NY and Albany NY. Having a lot of experience with escape rooms I was impressed with how elaborate and fun the room was! I went with escape room newbies and we all had a lot of fun and we ended up completing the escape room with just a few minutes to spare. We will definitely be returning!",
   "This was our second annual trip to Pursue the Clue. We've now completed both McWhirley's Mystery and Captain Fermi's Spaceship. Both rooms were excellent and a lot of fun. Some great memories were made here and can't wait to come back again and try the other room!",
   "We had a great time here on two different occasions in two very different rooms.  The level of help was just right, they didn't spoil it by too much help but  didn't let it get too frustrating on our own.   The workers were just great and the rooms were not just your run of the mill collection of puzzles but had a lot of thought put into them.",
   "Man, I really wanted to like this escape room because I know the owner has built them himself, which I think is awesome. Unfortunately, this was probably the worst escape room I have ever done, and I have done around 50, including the ones in Crossgates mall and Enigmatic Escape in Troy (which is far better). \n\nWe did McWhirely room. The flow of the room was awful-most of the clues we found were clues to solve puzzles that we had already solved. The person had to come in at the end to explain how many of the puzzles were meant to work- meaning that they did not work as they were supposed to for reasons that they were broken, or just not well designed. There were several things that just bothered me, demonstrating that almost no money is put back into maintaining the rooms. For example, the door is held together with an elastic band...why not just purchase a door hinge... This really impacted my perception of the room quality. For 26$ (including tax), I expect much better.\n\nThe escape room host was wonderful. But as someone who often does escape rooms, and while seeing the abundant of great reviews for this place , I felt I needed to say something. I think most of the people who view this as an excellent escape room experience have likely never done an escape room before.",
   "Great atmosphere, perfect level of challenge making you feel accomplished for solving each clue along the way without \"gimmes\" that sometimes feel like a cheap excuse to progress you along. You interact with the room, and the props and puzzles perfectly fit the thematic of the room. The experience had me and my partner laughing and enjoying ourselves every step of the way. Will definitely be returning and strongly recommend you check it out if you're in the capital region and love escape/mystery rooms!"

This is a nice food court with decent selection of fast food . would definitely visit again .",

The food court isn't the best but there are plenty of restaurants to make up for that. Love the variety of stores and that the mall itself is well maintained.",
   "I really like Crossgates Mall.\nMost of the time I have to go to Best Buy. \nThey have been getting more competitive price wise there. \nThey finally started to bring PC parts back, but there accessories prices like cables and adapters are priced high. \nEvery employee is always very polite and very helpful.",
   "This mall is HUGE! We have been here a few times as a family and we enjoy the assortment of stores as well as the actual time we send here. The mall is much nicer than most malls, it's in good repair and has plenty of space to stop and look around at things without being trampled. They have benches in the center of the walk areas for those that need to stop and take a rest or those who just want to relax.",
   "I went to funny bones to see a comedy show. The little part of the mall that I walk through was not that bad. On the way out I did stop at a jewelry store the people who are very nice even though they were getting ready to close they did allow us to stay and look everyone was quite polite and I didn't have any problem with any rowdy people overall it was a rather Pleasant night. The only thing was the parking. It was a cold night finding parking towards the door and then finding the actual place was hard when you've never been there because I don't do malls. If someone else were to come to the club that I'd want to see I would go again"

Very informative. \nIn the summer and some holidays it can get very very busy, with long waiting lines. \nMy kids love this place and the fudge. \nThey have a nice gift shop, coffee shop and you can buy their cheese and fudge there.\n** Go with a sweater or jacket, the temperature in the cavern is always 52 and you will need something.",

   "I have gone to a lot of dentists, but never thought that they were present to the patient experience.\n At Bethlehem Town Family Dental, Dr Henry and his staff demonstrate exceptional service and take great care in understanding the experience of the patient, both from a health and consumer point of view. They have up to date and cutting edge technology and take great care in making you comfortable and at ease. There are no surprises and there is always a discussion about cost, insurance coverage and options. Of course I am partial to my hygienist, Nick, but all of the staff is warm, welcoming and take the time to make you feel right at home!  During my last visit, they accommodated me with great, conscientious care; I felt like I was at the Spa! Thank you Bethlehem Town Family Dentist!\nK",
   "Having gone to my 1st appointment on 10/18/19 I was able to meet some lovely ladies.  The Dentist met with me & thoroughly explained everything and told me how to go about things. They made me feel at home and I left very pleased. (I recommend BTFD to anyone that is looking for a new dentist) you will not regret it. When you\u2019re received with a big welcoming smile it can\u2019t get any better.",
   "Great office and staff! The office is very accommodating to patient's needs and Nick the hygienist does a thorough job, would highly recommend!",
   "Easily the best dentist I\u2019ve been to.  Quick and professional.  Nick is a superstar technician and Dr Henry did some fillings that were virtually painless.\n\nDef recommend.",
   "Dr. Henry is awesome as well as his entire staff.  I switched to Bethlehem Town Family Dental when my previous dentist retired and was replaced with someone less knowledgeable and primarily focused on making money.  The technology is up to date and so far beyond what I was used to that I feel like I've had barbarians working on my teeth...up until now.  Such a great experience going here and I know Dr. Henry and his staff's primary focus is patient care and comfort.  I look forward to being a patient here for years to come."

We were able to see the comedians on stage and of course on the two screens.\nThe food and drink prices were ridiculously high for as lousy as they were, especially the popcorn.  The popcorn tasted like it was doused in salt.  For a 20oz bottle of water it cost $5.  We couldn't finish the popcorn because of how salty it was, and I certainly wasn't spending another $5 for a bottle of water.\nThe staff at the arena was nice and helpful with everyone especially when they were helping guests find their seats.",

You must have a tiny butt to seat in any of there seats.  And they always over book there seats and you need to find a usher.  They always correct the problems.

I've been parking there for over 6 years as my work is very local. \n\nToday I arrived at 6:50AM to the lower entrance. Upper opens at 7AM. When I arrived the man at the both was having trouble with the PC and needed to restart. The screen was sideways (Ctrl+alt+direction will fix) after him trying for 10 minutes to enter his password and use the mouse sideways he gave up. During this time 6 cars were waiting behind me. My credit card machine is down, you'll have to leave.\n\nLeave? I've been parking here for 6 years! I asked to speak to the manager, he said he was the Assistant Manager. Anytime this has happened in the past, they would let you through and I could pay on the way out. He started to get upset. They're not supposed to do that! Who were they, what booth, what did they look like.... He was far more concerned over them taking care of a customer than himself. \n\nHe made me pull into the garage and turn around and leave...over $8 of which I paid roughly $10k in parking over 6 years at 4-5 times a week. I've paid every single time on the way out as well. \n\nHe could care less. No one in his capacity should be management. Poor business decisions, and does not care for his customers.",
   "Great venue for concerts -- we had the moderately priced seats and the sound and sight lines were good.  But on the return to the parking areas, the escalators should have been set to bring us up but they were not.  We had to climb innumerable stairs on the return trip."

They also have fun short workshops available at certain times that introduce scientific topics to the little ones.

   "Split two burgers with my buddy.  The Spicy Burger (pictured, right) was well-prepared, but didn't really have enough kick for my taste.  The Peanut Butter Burger (pictured, left), however, was excellent.  Truly unique and surprising.  Would order again.",
   "This place had great beer and great burgers.  Angie was our server and provided us with the best of service!  She had a great personality and made sure we were always taken care of.  I would definitely come back here soon.",
   "The food was really good. Beer cheese dip and the Pig Mac burger. There were 11 beers on tap and one in the bottle. Nothing really screamed that it was the best beer ever, but all of them were good. Service was tremendous. Very lively and fun atmosphere.",
   "This was the first for us and it definitely won't be the last. Food is very delicious.  For our appetizer we got the pretzels and let me tell you.  They have to be the best around...amazing!  I got the chorizo chicken chili burger and I will definitely be back for that also.  My wife got the Druthers mac and cheese and that was also perfect.  Everything was perfectly cooked & seasoned.  The beer is tasty and fresh.  A must go in my book.  My sister doesn't drink so if you have the idea that it's a brewery I can't go there...YES you can and you'll be back."

   "The food was absolutely amazing. This is going to sound crazy, but one of my favorite things was the bread, maybe because I had never tasted any bread like that before.. If you like steak, I highly recommend the cowboy steak. My husband got that and I got the strip, my steak was great, but his was even better, which I couldn't believe there was such a difference! I'm not sure of the exact differences in the cut, seasoning or cooking method, but wow! Don't get me wrong, my strip steak was great, but mmmm, that cowboy was something else. \ud83e\udd23Our server Tim was phenomenal! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",
   "5 stars. Thumbs Up! Great place. Times are tough for the restaurant industry right now. So many are working hard to offer take out and delivery services they don't normally have. It's my husband's birthday and I was looking for a special meal since our original plans fell through. He mentioned wanting a steak, so when I came across a special family deal 677 was running, I knew we had to try it. The deal included two 7oz steaks, shrimp scampi, lobster mac and cheese, asparagus, bread, and donut holes. They even included a bottle of their steak sauce and a gift card to use when they reopen. Everything was delicious! I loved the char on the steak. I'm so glad I found this deal and supported a local business during this tough time. We will definitely be returning to the restaurant when they reopen. Recommend Google!",
   "Wow! Got the takeout curbside Prime Rib special. It was cooked just the way we asked with amazing seasonings. The roasted potatoes and carrots were delicious  too! A great value!",
   "Absolutely wonderful place. A bit heavy on the wallet, but certainly worth the price if you're in the mood to splurge. The steak was wonderful, and I had a ribeye for two to myself (as well as a strip steak and a wee bit of A5 wagyu).\n\nAs amazing as the food is, the pleasantness of the staff is also of note. They were very nice and comforting. All around, this is by far the most wonderful place for a steak in the capital region.",
   "Everything is always perfect from start to finish. The valet attendants are the nicest and upon walking in we are warmly welcomed by Jackie who always makes sure we are promptly seated somewhere comfortable. Our server Sergio is just fantastic--he is genuinely happy to be taking care of you and does a phenomenal job with absolutely everything."

   "Food was great! Came here for vegetarian options for a long overdue family gathering. Made reservations in advance was given two circle high top tables which were nice but not very conversation friendly especially since my grandmother was in attendance. This was also a dinner that had brought us together for the first time in a few years, that\u2019s the only complain I have. Would have asked for another table but there wasn\u2019t an open seat in the place. Great atmosphere , great food, would love to have given 5 stars but the seating thing really was a turn off especially because it was hard for my grandmother to get into the stools.",
   "Great venue. The bar staff were awesome and the nachos were extremely good! Saw the band Magic Giant.... What an awesome and intimate setting!",
   "Possibly the best wings I've had in a long time. Get the chipotle maple garlic wings! The pear and brie sandwich was creamy and fresh. Polite and friendly service. I'll definitely be back soon.",
   "Very nice atmosphere and a place to be on a Saturday evening. Food was very delicious and the service was top notch. \n\nWe were leaving when the live band was setting up and we could tell it will be an incredible night just by the few songs they  practiced  with.",
   "When you first enter, it seems like another upscale restaurant/pub. You might not expect much but bar that serves some food on the side. That is not what the Hollow is. After you enter the bar and see the main restaurant area, you can follow the place further back into more restaurant seating and then a live band/ extra bar area. The place is nicely decorated, perfectly lit and you don't need to use your phones flashlight just to view the menu. When we entered, we informed the hostess that we had reservations for about an hour ahead and we'd just grab a drink first. The bartender was nice, friendly, and efficient. They had an extensive drink and beer menu with a good amount of local and others on tap. There was a show at the TU center so the place was a bit full. We didn't expect to be seated for a while but they sat us probably a half hour before our reservation which was really nice, especially for a show night. The tables were close but you didn't feel like you were on each other's laps. The noise level was fine for a full house. \nWe ordered apps including muscles, soup, beer & cheddar dip, and a cheese board. It was all delicious. Our waiter gave good suggestions & he was very personable and attentive. They had a great menu, including several Veg & Vegan options which you don't find most places. After the apps, our meals didn't take long at all. They spaced it out like we requested which was nice because it can be a bit annoying when you  aren't even finished with the first few bites of your app and they bring out the entree. \nWe ordered burgers, sandwiches and mac and cheese but I will definitely be back for the other selections like the ahi tuna, salmon, other cheese boards and scallops. If you like sweet potato fries, you must order them.\n I wish I hadn't waited so long to go here."

Remind your date to get a appetizer or they will sit there envious, and hungry as you are served course after course of food. My food was cooked to perfection!  I have only positive things to say about all five courses!\nService was spectacular and the staff was well mannered and full of social niceties that many people and restaurants are lacking.",
   "Yono's is, without a doubt, the finest dining in Albany. An establushed culinary attraction for over 40 years, still expanding the palette of patrons with each visit. My guest and I ordered the prix fixe, I the 4 course and guest the 5 course rijsttafel. We also took advantage of the wine pairings with each course. The meals were superb, the wines delightful discoveries, many from New York State, and the service was exemplary.\n\nPictures are the second course plates. Exquisitely prepared and presented.\n\nVisit again and again!",
   "Everything about this place is fancy. The food, service and ambiance. But it is very expensive. They have a small menu but all the items are very well thought out and delicious. They also have wine pairing if you want.  The menu changes very often and the food is always fresh. There isn't a good place to park for free so heads up. \n\nWorth a visit for a celebration or something but too expensive to go regularly.",
   "Atmosphere just right with available seating on arrival... good timing during meal. Brett\u2019s service excellent! Cream of asparagus soup very flavorful... with fabulous catch of the day Cod... bourbon pecan tart... with coffee piping hot... Loved it!!!",

It is much nicer on the inside than it's strip Mall location would suggest. Parking is easy. They had live music the night I was there that was at just the right volume; a nice complement to conversation.",
   "One of the best restaurants I have ever visited. We were travelling and came upon this gem on our way. The food was excellent, the service fantastic and we had the greatest time. We ordered various dishes and all were excellent. The desserts were to die for. We will miss this place.",
   "The food was incredibly delicious. Everyone was very professional. They do not rush you, so if you\u2019re on a date, that\u2019s great. But if you\u2019re looking for a quick meal, this isn\u2019t the best choice. I would definitely return, but I\u2019m giving 3 stars instead of 4 because we were sort of forgotten after our desserts were brought to us.",
   "It is a small place with a lot of intimate areas. The menu is large and they have no issues with customizing your order. The portions are large and the food is very good. The eggplant parm is an appetizer and nicely done. They have a small area in the back with a large table for both groups. The place fills up fast. Even early so reservations are a must. The bathrooms are spacious and very clean.",
   "We ordered takeout during the mandatory lock down and were anything but unsatisfied. For starters the bread was phenomenal, soft inside with a good amount of crust (the olive tapenade is delicious and that's coming from someone who doesn't like olives at all!) . We ordered the Mixed greens and Cesar salad and were blown away by how flavorful the dressings were. For our main course we ordered the Chicken Antica and the Mediterranean and were delighted by how savory the sauces were. Chicken was juicy and well prepared. Abundant amount of shrimp in the Mediterranean with an amazing sauce. Overall it was a great meal and we will definitely be ordering from them again and look forward to eating in the restaurant once that's a possibility again. Highly recommend!"

   "Wow, what an exceptional restaurant!  Aside from the wonderful service, the food was all delicious!  The hanger steak was exquisite, and all of the appetizers were very delicious!  Lovely calamari, very tasty hot feta dip, among other things like the eggplant appetizer.  Really wonderful desserts, including the baklava, lemon sorbet, which came out inside of a lemon (very classy), and really tasty rice pudding.  Great wines from red to white!  For a 5 person dinner we had the most wonderful 3 course dining experience and every penny was well worth it!  We will be back often!  The setting is also very classy with a great live music set up at the front of the restaurant.",
   "Excellent Greek food. They cook to order so plan on a long enjoyable meal. Food is expensive but that is paying for quality and taste. Very good, even the simple things. \nMy only complaint is how noisy it can be when they are close to full. The beautiful hardwood floors and wood work reflect all the sound.",

   "We fondly remember our first meals at Caffe Italia. They included a trip to the liquor store on Allen St. to get our wine, a polite and professional waiter, and a very impressive linguine with steamed clams and white sauce that had ample garlic. The classic pot of espresso, with a bottle of anisette placed on the table, accompanied their home made cannolis to finish our meal. Time passes, now a thorough brigade service anticipates your needs, artfully navigating through a packed house. Our evening's entrees; Veal Luciana, Seafood Primavera and, of course, linguine with steamed clams and white sauce, were delicious and substantial. Caffe Italia remains true to its traditional \"Romeo Way\", but we do miss the pot and bottle to finish the meal."

We all found something on the menu to eat but there were no items on the lunch menu that would be the reason you would think of Jacks.  We had a nice meal but the lack of any steak and only one seafood entree on the lunch menu really missed the mark!  That's why only 4 stars.",

   "Just had the family style roast chicken meal and could not be more impressed. The ordering process was so easy. The food was outstanding. I don't know what part was my favorite because it was all so amazing. You can tell how much effort they put into each and every meal. Will definitely be returning. Thank you for still serving during these times.",
   "Such great food and an amazing staff.  My family and I have been going here for a little over a year and the food is consistently delicious.  We met the head chef and owner today, who were super welcoming and friendly.  The staff is super.  Great mix of savory and breakfast/sweet menu items...like chicken. And waffles.  Their French toast and home fries take it to the next level though!",
   "We just ordered the family style fried chicken meal and holy smokes. First, the ordering process was fast and easy. I called around 1:25pm, and chose our pick up time for 5:30. At that time I walked in, my bag was labeled with my name, and boom. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. The biscuits are so good; fried green tomatoes should be the title of a movie; and the fried chicken was superb. We\u2019re so fortunate to have places like this, and even more proud that they are providing meals to hospitals, first responders, etc. \u201cduring these uncertain times\u201d [btw thanks for your email every giant company I\u2019ve ever thought of]. But seriously, order a meal from Cuckoos Nest, you\u2019ll be pumped.",
   "A cozy atmosphere hosts very good food and great cocktails. The crave chicken sandwich and grit tots are excellent. Our waiter Miles was very helpful in helping us choose what tot get. Will definitely eat here again next time we're in town.",
   "May be the best southern cuisine in Albany (it's my first time here)... best chicken sandwich I've had in a while. Tasted the chicken entrees too but found it salty. Other than that the rest are good.  Stopped by in Albany on the way to VT. Tip: plenty of parking space right behind the restaurant."

   "Ramen was tasty but the conditions of the place are very old, dirty, and broken. It was hard to be there. Again. The soup was good. But I kept wondering about the conditions and couldn't help myself thinking about the germs in the kitchen and around us. Is the kitchen as dirty and greasy as everything around us? The bathrooms were ridiculously small. How can you (or waiters) clean yourself there?",
   "Absolutely delicious! Seats are a little uncomfortable, hard solid wood booths or metal stools. I only mentioned because my husband has back issues and was ready to leave as soon as we finished. We've been looking for good Ramen closer to home and we certainly found it!",
   "One of my Albany favorites! If you want authentic ramen in the Capital Region, this is the best place to go to in my mind. The atmosphere is very cool, despite the somewhat cramped dining area. If you don't mind being a little squished - when it's busy, that is - then you'll love it here!",
   "Happened to come across this restaurant in an old industrial area that seems to be attempting a revival as a hip residential area. Small diner turned ramen noodle shop. And what an excellent job they did. The ramen is well done, both the noodle and the broth. Fellow diners said the pork dumpling was excellent, too."

And there is more than just tofu and salads. Me and my friends have tried over half the menu and have not had one complaint. The bowls are a great size, definitely suggest if you are hungry! \nMy friends love the Jax- typically sells out due to popularity.

   "Horrible food that was very overpriced. I had a lobster \"bisque\" that was little more than a flavorless broth with a cracker in it. The main course was a portion for a super model and was of similar quality. We had to wait almost an hour and a half  before we had our appetizer. I'm not sure what the issue was but the waitor blamed it on the kitchen and gave us a free bottle of champagne over it. Regardless it was clear that there was a serious lack of communication with the staff. I will never go back. Have never been more disappointed. \ud83d\ude41",

And at least three still empty as we left. I don't think they took into account that the sub Arctic air blowing in every time front door opened. No fun had! Also food arrived warm not hot."

Breakfast menu was simple and direct and the options just right, price was a bit high, but like the normal diner high. Everyone was nice and the atmosphere was pleasant. I got a window sofa chair type seat and the view outside was serene and calming. I ordered a egg Benedict and green tea. Food was good. It was also the only place open on Christmas and it was warm. Quick tip, your water glass smelled a bit funky 8/10",
   "The food was amazing.  But best of all, our server Salvatore was the best ever. Very knowledgeable about the dishes and he explained everything very well. He is a great asset to your  stablishment.",
   "Really nice venue, friendly staff and great bar service. Bartender Alanna, very prompt and attentive, politely and friendly - she's great at what she does. Enjoyed the drinks \"Hip Hop Anonymous\" was my favorite. Will definitely revisit.",
   "Good food, good service. I get grilled salmon every time I go - it's delicious and I can't seem to cook salmon as well at home. (I try to only order things out that I don't cook at home.)",
   "I highly recommend the weekend breakfast/brunch menu. Pancakes are amazing as well as the honey whipped butter. NY Benedict was worth the price in my opinion. Dinner is great for the most part. The best thing about this place for me is the Campfire in a Jar. It is one of the best desserts I've ever had. I love the modern interior and cool ambience."

Pretty greasy, not much flavor (especially considering the creative menu), and didn't seem all that fresh.  Might give it another shot someday, but not going out of my way to do so.",

Cool decoration albeit not Mexican, and friendly staff. We were a group of 7 and we had a take booked online, however the place was half empty on s Fri night so I don't think reservations are needed.",

My husband got the pizza navona (margherita pizza essentially, fresh Italian style pizza made in a brick oven, best in Albany) like he usually does and I got their reasonably priced ($15) salmon. It was a proper portion which meant I was unable to overeat its deliciousness like my American nature wants to and FULL of flavor, the roasted asparagus, greens, and onion in the yogurt sauce was sooooooo good. We also got the chickpea panzanella side ($3, great price for a decent sized side that most places would charge $6 for) and were very pleased. I do wish they had pasta offerings for lunch besides a pasta salad, but I was not displeased with my options. I'll be back and I'm probably going to have to try their turkey pepperonata sandwich next. \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd6a\ud83d\udc4c",

   "While the bartender was very pleasant, clearly the kitchen was attempting to pass along food very poorly prepared. My friend and I both ordered their $14 Reuben sandwich. Both came out burnt, with over done fries. Really disappointing since clearly they attempted to use some really nice ingredients. We had order at later point in the evening, and perhaps the cooks felt that we were the standard intoxicated crowd, given the large numbers of bars in the area, unable to tell the difference. However, we weren't and left disappointed. My best guess is the bartender felt a bit embarrassed about the food, as once it was laid in front of us, eye contact was not made again until it was time to pay. That being said, she listened to our displeasure at the meal professionally and completely. Perhaps, the only saving grace for this location.  The location itself is nicely decorated, however stay away from the restrooms if possible, as they have a very strong odor reminiscent of some dive bars with the ice filled urinals of old. All being said and done, this location left an actual bad taste in my mouth, and while I hope they begin to produce a product worth consuming, I won't be returning.",
   "This is a place that many people bring up, but I feel disappointed for the price of the things on the menu and the level of satisfaction I felt.\n\nI've come here twice, and feel I spent $30 for a $20 experience each time. It's not much money, but the disappointment stings. It's slightly above average food, presented well at a higher price point. But Applebee's is just as good.\n\nThe staff are nice enough. It's less loud than Lionheart which is about next door, and I feel has equivalent food, so it's a matter of preference. \n\nThis is a decent enough place meet someone for a short bite, but I don't see any reason to go out of my way for what I get here."

Believe it or not a lot of people go vegan for the environment and your excessive use is really deterrent for those people. \nThe side containers are recyclable but you provide no area to do so!",
   "Very good quality vegan food. The coffee's great too. While you can have these anytime of the day, this is perfect for breakfasts. The ambience is wonderful!"

Who would have thunk it, a great Taiwanese restaurant in middle of NY upstate.\n\nGot soup dumplings and spicy sour steamed dumplings, both great.\nOur group ordered house special soup (beef and pork chop) with thick noodles, mapo bean curd, beef and curry pot and fried chicken with fried rice.\n\nWe were not really hungry, but that changed when food arrived, we killed each dish. \nVery rare we order many and all turn out to be good.\nPrices were fair too.\nWill be back, highly recommended. Thanks.",
   "Taiwan Noodle is absolutely amazing! The place may not look like much from outside but the food is tremendously delicious and authentic. The restaurant is clean and well organized. I will definitely be coming back often! Also the service was very good and all the workers friendly!",
   "Homey Taiwanese food. Authentic, but nothing that will blow your mind. They\u2019re consistent and the flavor is solid. Great type of food for a rainy Sunday afternoon. The minced meat and egg rice is the best, along with their beef noodle soup. The bamboo rice is lacking because the flavor from the meat failed to deep into the rice. This is the type of place for a quick meal and home style cooking. Reminded me of my times in Taiwan, but didn\u2019t quite hit the mark.",
   "Definitely would come back here for their dim sum! All of it was good and reasonably priced. The seafood casserole was filled with perfectly cooked seafood, but may not be everyone\u2019s favorite dish. Their noodles were just fine."

   "Food was excellent as always. Over the past 20 years Whenever I am visiting Albany I make it a point to stop there for dinner. Although the restaurant has changed hands-on number of time the quality of the food has not diminished. The owner of the restaurant was kind enough to take 25% off of our bill because we were having dinner 45 minutes before the sale price was slated to begin. Woul highly recommend"

The food is localy produced (grown) and freshly made how you want it every time",

And orders other stuff it is really good. The ingredients they chose is fresh and good quality and the way how they make the food just make ppl feel so great to eat and stomach really happy about it too",
   "Delicious Gourmet Chinese food. Great customer service. Parking available in the back of the restaurant or on the street. This place is a go to when I\u2019m in Albany.",
   "Rain is the best Chinese in the city! Great service, full menu selection, slightly pricey but not so for what you get. And the food is FRESH! Everything from shrimp to chicken to vegetables is very fresh. Hot food comes hot and cold food is cold. Nothing on steam tables. 5 stars for me!!",
   "This is my go-to Chinese place since moving to Albany and it's pretty solid each time. However, there are some things that bug me about this place which I want to note. I've only ordered take-out so I can't speak much about the service but the people at the counter are always professional and courteous. \nMy main issue is with the dumplings and crab rangoons - there's too much filling. The pork dumplings taste like you're eating bacon with how much pork is packed in there. This may not be a bad thing to some people. Hell, you might actually look at it as a good thing which is understandable. But I like a good ratio between filling and the outer shell and Rain overdoes it on the filling.\nTheir hot and sour soup is also pretty weird. I ordered it once and there were very questionable pieces of meat in it. My guess is they re-purpose their burnt/unusable meat and put it in the hot and sour soup. I'd avoid it if I were you.\nI recently ordered the wok seared salmon with garlic sauce and it was delicious. I'm a big fan of spice and this was super spicy. But...there was no warning of it being spicy (at least not on their online menu) so beware of surprises. I was kind of disappointed in the lack of vegetables as well. The description states \"served with mixed vegetables\" but all I received were mushrooms and onions. For the price, some zucchini or broccoli  would have been nice (asparagus is really good with salmon, just FYI).\nOverall, Rain is probably the best you're gonna get in the area. Always consistent and the food (aside from the hot and sour soup) is fresh and cooked well.",

The food was very good that I had. I had the smash burger. Others in the party said the food was very good as well. The Bish-up looked very good.",
   "I was super excited to finally try The Bishop.  I was happy I read reviews before I made a reservation because previous reviews said that it took awhile to get food was very accurate.  And I would highly recommend reservations since this is a very small place.  My friend and I quickly put in our drink order in, but it took awhile to get our beers - I saw them sitting at the bar for a little while.  Both my friend and I ordered the french onion soup since we heard that it was pretty amazing.  I thought the soup was pretty good although my friend said that her soup wasn't really warm.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for the soup.  I also ordered the smash burger which was very disappointing.  The two patties weren't as smashed as one would expect and honestly, it was very bland, seemed to be no seasoning.  Also, our waiter never checked in on us the whole night.  I had to get his attention in order to get the check.  \nThe whole experience was a bit disappointing.  I did go on a night when there was a show at the TU so I can understand that service might not have been the best, so I would try the place again on maybe a quieter night.  However, there aren't many places to eat in downtown before a show so I feel like The Bishop still needs to deliver on quality.",
   "The food was good and so was the customer service. It got pretty busy after my group walked in, and our waitress never forgot about us. We also needed menu modifications due to dietary restrictions and it wasn't a problem at all. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in the area.",
   "Wonderful duck with brie and French fries cooked in duck fat. Have also had a great steak salad. Imaginative delicious food and great service. Love the view to outside. Also a fireplace. Highly recommended. Great addition to downtown.",
   "Beautiful place! Decor is spectacular, the selection of whiskeys is impressive, they make great drinks and are super friendly. Recommend you check it out! I was there too late to try the food menu but plan on a return trip for sure."

   "One of the most talked about Chinese restaurant in the Capital Region is perhaps Zi Jing Ge, because compare to other Chinese restaurants around the area, this is one of the better ones. You can order lunch and dinner for under $10 and usually comes with a lot of food, which is something I like. For students, they get 10% of the bill, which is still better than nothing. The environment of this place is fantastic, and has a contemporary look to it with calligraphies hanging on the wall. I enjoyed their food even though it\u2019s the typical Chinese food you find in other Chinese restaurants, but still, it was delicious. I would definitely order from here again."

To our surprise, we found the food to be pretty good. Everyone enjoyed there meals. We decided to eat there every other movie visit.",

   "Best pad thai ever!!\nIt\u2019s sweet and salt with just a bit spicy. with a top of peanut crunch, perfect!",
   "I wish I could give some negative ratings to this place. I went there for lunch  with my friends and ordered drunken noodle with chicken. The food was good and tasty but you would not believe the amount they have given for one person. The quantity was much less compared to any similar kind of noodle plate I had in USA or Albany in any Thai place. \nBut that's not the worst part. The worst part is when I asked politely about the amount, a woman(may be the head/manager) came shouting at me saying that's what they serve. \nAnother of my friend ordered pineapple fried rice with no meat and it wasn't of less amount like mine.  \nI have heard average reviews about this place so I went but it seems like it was my bad luck or may be they are the worst kind of people to run a restaurant and need to learn how to behave with customers.\n\n(I wish I had the picture of pineapple fried rice or similar noodle from a different restaurant to compare)",
   "Small but cute with a nice ambience. Menu has a nice selection of pan-Asian dishes. I ordered the salmon green curry and my husband got the pad thai. Both were excellent and well presented. Taking one star off as we asked for a spice level 7 and they turned it up to 11 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
   "Don\u2019t order from here if you\u2019re looking for pho. The broth taste like it\u2019s just hot water and a beef bullion. The chicken yakisoba, Thai iced coffee and spring rolls were good though.",
   "TapAsia was delicious and authentic thai resturant located on Lark Street ik m Albany, NY. I had the Aloha which was a scallop and Chicken dish seved in a half pineapple. It came in a few different levels of spice and flavor, i has hot thai. It was VERY SPICY but flavor was great and if you like a lot of heat. That be your dish. \n\nWe had sticky rice and mango for desert. \n\nEverything was ok n ppint and waitstaff couldnt be friendlier. \n\nAtmosphere was trendy and warm. Very clean. We sat outside on the small patio.\n\nA hidden gem."

   "Since it was my first time there I was offered samples of their three barbecue sauces. All of them had great flavor with good spice.\n\nI went with the quarter okie chicken plate with cornbread, potato salad, and mac and cheese. The chicken was delicious and very moist. The cornbread had either maple in it or maple butter which was great. Mac and cheese is kind of what you would expect from a school room lunch but better. I didn't even have room to finish the salad. \n\nI'll definitely be back.",

   "The wings were great, however almost everything else was a let down. If you're going to spend $85 on a couple of dishes you'd expect them to be good. The mac n cheese was super plain. The bacon mac n cheese had crumbs on top that were way over cooked and made the meal not a because they were all stuck together and very hard. The chicken sandwich and the pulled pork was good also the sauce is great quality its just the side dishes that need work.",

   "This was our first visit and we already know that we will be back. When we made our original reservation it was to use a Groupon but then found out that our reservation was for the first night of Albany's annual restaurant week. Dinner included an appetizer, entree and dessert for $25 per person. It was well worth it. We also ordered 2 different bottles of wine to accompany our meals off a nicely varied menu. Everything we had was well prepared, beautifully presented and delicious. We look forward to experiencing the full menu choices on our next visit. We do wish that the restaurant offered better parking options as they have no parking lot of their own and most parking options entail a significant walk to the restaurant which can be difficult for those with a disability.",
   "LaSerre never disappoints! Our server, John, was knowledgeable, courteous and attentive without being obtrusive and the food is always phenomenal from appetizer through dessert! We will continue to return. If you have never been there, treat yourself; you will NOT be disappointed!",
   "Tucked in the back streets off State St near the Times Union Center. The restaurant is nicely decorated with nice wood paneled walls, and dark mirrors, and a few wine bottles and wine glasses. It was dimly lit with a chandelier and some wall sconces. It could be a somewhat romantic setting, though the seating was fairly close to others. The atmosphere reminded me of a cross between a study in a fancy house, the kind that would have a leather arm chair, and a speak easy. However, something about the decor seemed like it was only 80% of the way there but lacked some finishing touches.\n\nThe waiter was attentive but without being annoying, he seemed to come around at just the right time. There were about three or four other groups dining at the time, but the place wasn't very large, so it was probably at least half full.\n\nWe ordered two martinis, one chocolate flavored and one that was more tropics themed. We then ordered off the restaurant week menus which are three course prix fix menus. For an appetizer I ordered fig caprese. It was good, though only a slight variation of a regular caprese as the fig taste wasn't too strong. The main course I choose the beef bourguignon and my girl got the mushroom ravioli. The bourguignon was a bit salty for my taste, though it tasted similar to many of the beef bourguignon I've had in the past. The ravioli tasted really good, had a very nice mushroom flavor without being overwhelming. There was two choices, a flourless chocolate cake and a lemon something (I kinda stopped listening after I heard chocolate). We both ended up getting the chocolate cake, which was so rich and thick it was like eating a creamier version of fudge. I didn't finish the cake as the sweetness was a bit overwhelming, though I did finish the other half later as a snack.\n\nOverall it was a nice place, though it probably doesn't stand out on anyone's toes 10 list.",
   "One of the best filets I\u2019ve ever had! The restaurant and it\u2019s ambience were perfect, service was excellent and the food was incredible. Couldn\u2019t ask for more!",
   "Food is really not fresh, made my stomach sick after coming home. I told the server the food isn\u2019t fresh and he told me back \u201cno other people said anything\u201d. The food is also overpriced and really not worthy your money."

   "My husband and I have been coming here since inception and I feel the time is appropriate to leave a review. \nSometimes we come just for drinks, other times we bring family and friends for a brunch or dinner. Consistently we were impressed with the quality of service but more importantly,  with the food they serve. I love when I find a place that understands the essence of food. It needs to engage the senses. The inviting aroma arising from an appealing plate arrangement calling you to take a bite. And when you taste it,  the richness and depth of flavor caresses your taste buds. That is exactly what I get in this restaurant and what brings me back. I find their prices reasonable as I usually end up paying more for the food of this quality.",
   "I love a good neighborhood dive, but this is a pretty clear upgrade over Center St Pub.\n\nDrink menu is well-priced \u2014 signature cocktails were all $10, every wine was $9 or less and beer was as it should be \u2014 and varied. Food menu was small but had variety.\n\nPlenty of space, too. Huge bar, lots of tables and a more cozy area under the domed windows that remain from CSP. TVs and wooden/cork dartboards are here for anyone looking for activities while you drink.\n\nMy one (minor) complaint is you have to print the actual beer on a beer menu. Saying it\u2019s a Jack\u2019s Abby \u2018seasonal lager\u2019 or a Grimm \u2018double IPA\u2019 doesn\u2019t really help."

I got chicken with mushroom and the mushrooms were the big black mushrooms I am not a fan of the way they taste. \nI want to give this place another try though since all the reviews make it sound so tasty hopefully I will find something I LOVE :)",

   "This is probably the best Chinese food I've ever had. The restaurant is an unassuming little hole in the wall, but it is a hidden treasure. The menu has a lot to choose from, including some items that Americans might find strange, which I consider a mark of authenticity. As the name suggests, there are a lot of seafood options on the menu. This is a fine place to either eat in or take out; the atmosphere is pleasant. For those who eat in, there is a large round table where groups can sit down for dim sum. Dine-in customers also get hot oolong tea, which may be the best hot tea I've ever had in a Chinese restaurant. The fact that this place is open late is also a plus. I recommend Ocean Palace to all my friends who ask what a good Chinese restaurant in Albany is.",

   "Delicioso! Simply put. Have only been there a couple times but they have great food in good portions for a decent price. I recommend the BBQ Chicken salad. Already ate HALF before I even took the photo.",
   "Great place for drinks, wings, laughter and sports! I enjoyed my time there!! Highly recommended fam.",
   "I used to go to Junior's all the time... back in the day. This was my first time back in a little over a year and it has changed. It appears that some updates have been made and the menu has changed a bit.\nWe ordered mozzarella with raspberry sauce. It came out with marinara but when we told the waitress she returned fairly quickly with the raspberry sauce. We also ordered the Harvest Salad. It used to be called the Autumn Harvest Salad and it used to come with chicken on it. It was good but I was surprised when it came out without chicken. We also ordered the boneless moonshine wings. The boneless wings were good but they were a bit small and I'm not convinced the price is in alignment with the quantity. Overall it was pretty good.",
   "The food and service are always GREAT!!!  The Manger and the staff are top notch.  Great environment coupled with the food and service.... Can't go wrong.  Give it a try and you'll be glad that you did.  Don't leave without trying to peanut butter whiskey.... Awesome",
   "Friendly and quick staff. Ordered for take -out and thenfoid was hot. Moonshine wings have a mustard base sauce which is pretty good."

   "Great place to have a delicious meal. This places looked small from outside but had lots of space inside. The entrance is on the side. The food was amazing, and the menu has so much to choose from. The service was great, and I would highly recommend it to others visiting the area. It was nice to have a reasonably priced dinner while visiting upstate NY.",
   "Went for Happy Hour and got an AMAZING Strawberry Margarita for $5! The guacamole was fresh and delicious and the service was top-notch! I will definitely be visiting again soon!",
   "Food was okay, I could tell it was microwaved because of the beans. Devil meat was not spicy, just had chipotle sauce. They give alot of chips and salsa which is nice. Decor and atmosphere is lively and beautiful. Might be one of the few Mexican places here so maybe go once for drinks and appetizer.",
   "We were staying in Albany for the baseball hall of fame weekend and went here on Sunday after the induction ceremony and were totally impressed.  We're from Seattle and have oodles of Mexican joints. This is in our top 5. Margaritas by the pitchers are the way to go. My wife have the child rellenos with poblanos was excellent.  I had the chicken and beef\nfajitas was enough for two and very good. Sarah our server was excellent and very sweet. \nIf you got a hankering for Mexican,  the patron is a must!"
