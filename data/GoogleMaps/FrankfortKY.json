I highly recommend checking out the Salato Center if you have never been.",

Some things have been added which is nice but as nature may go, I was sad to see the dragonfly marsh pretty much dried up. That was one of my favorite spots as a child. Great place to go to see some interesting animals and learn a lot.",
   "Loved this experience. It's not overwhelming and very beautiful and educational. The entrance fee isn't much and they have plenty opportunity for walking trails.  All the animals were outside and playing and the streams were gorgeous!",
   "The price is reasonable and it is an educational for kids of all ages. It isn't a zoo so don't expect a large variety of exotic animals it is filled with local wildlife. It makes a nice day especially if you pack a meal and a fishing pole for trip."

   "What an amazing distillery. It just has so much character. Did the hard hat tour and loved it. Even my teenage son thought it was cool! I have always loved their bourbons and it was neat to see the process up close.",
   "My wife and I toured Buffalo Trace Distillery this morning.   We arrived about an hour early and were the first two in line.   I was upset at first because there was no EH Taylor in the gift shop.   \n\nThen it was time for our tour.   What a great experience!   And we were blessed to have Freddie as our tour guide.  (Even though he advised me to buy a new hat. (I was wearing my Maker\u2019s hat).   Freddie is very humble and shared some amazing stories with us.  I quickly forgot about the gift shop not being stocked with EH.   We finished the tour with a tasting, I must mention both the tour and tastings are free!   \n\nAs I was walking downstairs, back to the gift shop I saw people carrying those beautiful E.H. Taylor cardboard tubes.   I quickly ran to the back and Score...I grabbed one of the last 3 left!  \n\nPerfect day!   \n\nJason Wachenschwanz\nColumbus, Ohio",
   "Buffalo Trace Distillery was by far my favorite place to visit of the three I got a tour of this weekend. The place was amazing and full of sight, what made it more amazing was my tour guide David. He knew American Sign Language and signed the whole time. I understood more about the process from David than from the other places without the accessibility provided. The facts about how large this place is, how big the still and processing tanks are just blows my mind. The other distilleries I visit had tanks in the 7000-7,500ish gal tank, these had up to 9,400 or in that range. I like the fact that they recycled their leftovers and used the \u201ctar\u201d to produce energy for the whole system. **I highly recommend that if you are Deaf, or knows someone that wants to visit Buffalo Trace, to call or email them and request David. He is not an interpreter but does an really good job making sure you understood the history and science of making Bourbon. **",
   "This is an amazing distillery.  I did not do the tour, as time did not allow it.  Their gift shop still took about an hour to peruse through.  Their prices are extremely reasonable for this type of place.  I will definitely stop back and attempt to do the tour.",
   "Such a cool place. Learn a bit of history, take a free tour around the grounds see where the make all the delicious bourbons. It was a dream come true to be able to come visit this place."

   "It was a really cool place and it really works, every 5 minutes it moves, I talk to someone that takes care of it and there are few clots like this around the world but this is the only one in the US. It was beautiful.",
   "From the time I was a little boy, I have enjoyed the Floral Clock and tossing coins, making a wish as the coin went into the water. \nMy dad would take us riding around town and one of our favorite places would be the Capitol area, I do recall as a youngster, just how the mansion was an eye sore, now it is a beautiful home, a pride of Frankfort.\nI have seven children and they all have been to the clock numerous times, all throwing a coin into the water, some of them wishing and those to young just enjoying following suit with their siblings.\nTo this day, I still find myself riding around with my family and we continue the tradition of heading to our State Capitol Grounds.\nWonderful memories...",
   "If you need a respite from traveling across the state what, take the exit off of I-64 to the Kentucky state capitol in Frankfort magnificent building and complex with this extra special surprise. Beautifully maintained",
   "I enjoyed seeing this beautiful floral clock on Wednesday, June 27, 2018 and on Tuesday, April 3, 2018.\n\nIt impressed me to see a large outdoor clock with plants inside it, as it did when I first saw it in 1972 on my eighth grade class trip. During my June visit this year the clock looked magnificent with colorful blooms and greenery. However, the plants did not look that beautiful on the April visit, probably due to it being early in the growing season in Kentucky.\n\nA plaque near the clock provides details about it. And a nice fountain is located below its base that added to the beauty during my June visit. The fountain did not have water in it when I visited in April.\n\nI urge persons in the area to take a few minutes to visit Kentucky's Floral Clock, read the plaque, and take a photo of it. There no charge to view or photograph the clock. Since it is outside in a public area, I guess it can be viewed 24 hours a day. \n\nThe clock is located beside the Kentucky State Capitol Building. I walked from downtown to the capitol building and the clock, but the Frankfort city bus service has a stop near the clock. The bus service runs from early morning to late afternoon Monday-Friday except for holidays, with a more limited schedule on Saturday. It runs once an hour and only costs 25 cents.",
   "This was a neat place. The clock is huge and the flowers look amazing. Very unique place to visit."

Make sure to breathe in the perfume of the sweet magnolia blooms. If you go to the floral clock, go around to check out the tropical garden at the back dedicated to Governor Bert Combs.",

Everyone should go.\nIt's a bit of an adventure just trying to find it, but trust your directions and the field opens up to you.\n\nMake sure you bring water bottles in the summer. There are water fountains, but it's more convenient.\n\nI still find myself day dreaming and my mind drifts to the works I visited in the park. Pictures don't do justice to something 20 feet tall that you can touch and spin and stand under. \nLike all good art, you leave with the feeling that your sense of the world has been challenged in some way.",

   "I had a great time at this place. I stopped here while on a road trip from Missouri to Virginia. It was the perfect place to stretch my legs and walk around. There were no paved sidewalks, simply open fields, with mowed paths. There were sculptures that encouraged climbing as well as those that requested be left untouched . The paths themselves were wide enough to fit a group of people and enclosed enough to keep the next sculpture more of a reveal; which was nice. \n\nMy son was able to run and burn his energy and I was able to enjoy the art, hopefully instilling an appreciation of it in him as well. \n\nThere\u2019s a donation box near the entrance/exit . I know not many people carry cash but the place is free so leaving what you can helps, I\u2019m sure."

A pedestrian bridge can take you to the other side of the river where there is another park with trees and another bridge (more for sitting down on a bench and having a smoke; I think that one side of it is fenced-in, i.e., cannot go across).",

I\u2019d highly recommend you to check this place out if you come to Frankfort.  They have to benches on the dock.  A few trees that over hang the dock for some natural shade.",

There are a few openings to expansive fields and some panoramic views. The red trail makers are not clear at some turns because of the unmarked maintenance trails. So bring the trail map. Also my step app clocked this walk closer to 3 miles than one and half. You should not get lost.",
   "This is a nice, quiet place. It has, however, seen better days. When I was there it was in need of maintenance and mowing.",
   "Wonderful, a refuge not only for the wildlife, but also for you. No endless housing sprawl, traffic, noise, and asphalt. Don't get me wrong, I like living in Lexington; but access to this place is priceless. I couldn't stop watching the precious little creatures flitting about sipping water and looking for seeds. Good that it's a bit out of the way; I rather prefer it. Well done, Audubon!",
   "Clean, however I must have gone at the wrong time of year, saw more wildlife on the road getting there than in sanctuary",
   "This is a nice place to come for a walk. There are very few visitors most days. Today there were only three cars when I arrived. I only saw two people on the trails. I hiked the Red Trail today, which is a nice 2 mile walk when combined with the yellow Trail. For a Wildlife Preserve though you see very little wildlife. I saw evidence of owls and heard a woodpecker and heard a few wild birds, but that was it. There is no entrance fee though they suggest a donation of $4. Also the Buckley Wildlife Sanctuary is now run by Life Adventure Center of Woodford County. Basically this is a good place to come if you want to get away from it all for a little while and just have some solitude in nature.\nEDIT: Definitely more wildlife now, as Whitetail Deer have come back. I see a few every time I'm out there!"

We purchased the premier tasting. Francine suggested a couple of wines that were out of our \"normal\" wine preference and we were pleasantly surprised. She also made a few simple sangrias, which were very simple and delightful. We also had 2 cheeses (with the tasting), which made the tasting complete. The cheeses were delicious! We also had the privilege of tasting several wine jellies, which were just heavenly. We ran into a few, very nice locals, which made for great conversation. Near the end of our tasting, Joey came in and did a toast from his grandfather (and founder), which made our experience even more special. If you are passing through or in the area, please stop in here. You will not be disappointed!",
   "Been wanting to try some Kentucky wine, and my husband and I were lucky enough to stumble upon this winery. The tasting room is located in the house. We were a little hesitant when we stepped out of the vehicle, but were warmly greeted by one of the winery owners, Joey Sloan. The tasting room, like it's owners, was inviting. \nFrancine, Joey's wife and co-owner, was helping us with our tastings. We are mostly semi-sweet to sweet wine drinkers, but she convinced us to get out of our comfort zone and try some dry wines too. Mixed a few of the wines with fruit juices to make our own sangria. \nShe gave us a nice history of her family and their winery. Francine also makes wine jelly, so we received nice samples of that too. Cheese and cracker platters were also available for purchase. One of the nicest winery experiences I've had in a long time.",
   "Francine and her son were amazing! Best presentation I have ever came across.  From pairing each wine, telling us how to mix different sangria's  and the wine jellies such an awesome experience.  We will be back!",

We realized he was one of the owners even before he told us because he was so passionate about his work & the horses. Even though he is a young man, he is quite experienced & knowledgeable about the breeding process & the horse industry as a whole. He was always ready to answer our questions & provide additional information when requested. Being able to see & touch the mares & their foals was a wonderful experience for us. As Brett's parents led some horses by, they also greeted us & shared their expertise with us. The farm itself is breathtaking--some of Kentucky's finest, most beautiful rural acreage with a rich history of its own. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed this visit. We highly recommend it to anyone traveling through the area who is interested in horses, history, or just the beauty of our great Commonwealth.",

If you have kids this is a excellent place to bring them to not only learn about horses, history,  genealogy, interaction with real horses, but shows too. I would highly recommend this place if you are in town or the area. I live 4 hours away and well worth the drive and money to visit.",
   "Spectacular! So much better than we expected! Just phenomenal! The horse museum is so fantastic! Could spend hours there. So interesting. \n\nIt's a great space, it's really a fun for all ages!",
   "Southern Light Christmas show was fun and creative. Lots of food, animal petting zoo, local merchants booths and a 3 mile course of top notch lights. Very classy and fairly priced. Good family fun. Its an annual program that everyone should attend. The Ky. Horse park provides great community service with this program.",
   "Went during Southern Lights, always enjoy the atmosphere. Cheaper through the week and less waiting in lines for the vendors that offer their  merchandise,  food vendors and the exotic zoo. The zoo is free but you can buy carrots and seed to feed the animals for a reasonable charge of $3.00 and $2.00. Camel rides are also available for a fee. The gift shop offers all types of horse related gifts for the horse lovers on your list. Also, they offer train rides for all to enjoy, no fee for this. And for the train enthusiast, they have several indoor scaled train displays. Some are interactive, some are not. But an enjoyment for all.\n We go every year, have made it a tradition."

   "Heaven on earth! One of my favorite places. So much fun even if you don't bet.  You see all types of folks; so fun to watch people and of course the horses. Such a beautiful place! Great for families too.",
   "Keeneland is a great track. It's very laid back compared to Churchill Downs. The setting is also beautiful tucked into the rolling hills of Lexington. Only problem you'll potentially face is a little traffic, but if you time it right you won't have a problem. Relaxing and beautiful.",
   "I have yet to go to Keenland as a general admission spectator. My first time in April 2019 was through a clubhouse name-on-a-list type deal per Malone's whose GM was supposed to have a box. We weren't given the number so never did end up sitting in a box just clubhouse grandstand. Never ate in the dining room but got dressed up almost for nothing. Really enjoyed Blue Barbecue brisket plate. Now the same venue is only serving the sandwich but it is still really good. During this Fall Meet, we had a reservation in the Paddock dining area. The service took a while but they made up for it in the end. The lunch selections had some traditional foods and great salad options. Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary. Horse racing and access to the horses was easy. Took in a few races down at the dirt, a couple in the mezzanine, and some from the paddock walk abouts. Also did valet parking and that ran like clockwork, cost $10.",
   "Nice place to walk on a misty morning.  After enjoying breakfast at the Track Kitchen, walk the grounds and watch horses running for practice.  Good food, courteous service, beautiful campus.",
   "I love Keeneland!  If you ever visit Lexington, Kentucky, this is a must do.  You can get so close to the horses and jockeys either up by rails or in the paddock area.  Plus, there are so many ways to bet on the horses and watch the races.  Their food and beverages are great as well.  If you want some more up close and personal behind the scenes experiences, they offer a wide variety of tours for a small fee.  It really is for everyone.  You can spend as much or as little as you want and still have a great time.  Not to be missed!"

Nice facility, modern gift shop, good tour and good tasting.\nWhat the cool thing is you can pick and buy private barrel for under nine grand. \nDon't forget say hello to Jimmy Russell and ask him to sign your bottle.",
   "Did the tour while on vacation. It was nice but the highlight was meeting Jimmy Russell in the gift shop and having him sign a bottle of Single Barrel Rye and getting our pic taken. He talks with you like he's known you for years. Very awesome experience if you are a lover of bourbon.",
   "Nice selection of bourbon products in the gift shop each time I've visited.  Always something available that's not readily available in the local package stores.  Unlike another, very large and popular distillery in the area (cough, cough Sazerac's Buffalo Trace) this gift shop is worth the visit for something unique being available to come home with.  Thank you!",

He was very knowledgeable  about every place we toured, plus he added humor to the tour!  We had a delightful time ending the tour 3.5 hours after starting, and we came away with much more knowledge about horses, the farms, and previous famous horses than when we started!  We highly recommend this tour company.  You won\u2019t regret it!",
   "Very interesting tour to learn more about the industry. Saw some notable races horses and some intriguing facilities. Mike our tour guide was very knowledgeable.",
   "Our Guide was fantastic! We were met promptly, our mini bus was full. He was local so new all the history of Keeneland  Racey, the farms we visited and was a Betologist! Who knew one can be a connoisseur! Our involved visiting the racetrack, stopping by the visiting Budweiser Klidedales, visiting the resting place of Seattle Slew and big money winner Curlin's stud farm. We stopped at Kenny MCpeek's farm and met Curlin's Colt. We made our way past other Kentucky farms.  Remember to tip your Guide!",

Vicky was so informative and extremely passionate about educating us all about the farms, horses, etc.  It was breathtaking to see Keeneland, the gorgeous farms and the beautiful horses!! I loved being able to get up close and personal with the yearlings and the retirees.  It was a fabulous day that we'll never forget!  Thank you!"

   "This is as close to a home distilling family run place as you will find. The tour was great for the information and conversations with the female guide. I give the tour experience a 5 star even though the place is small and a bit bootleg.\n\nI give the bourbon a 3 star because I was not too fond of it. I am more of a regular beer drinker but have bourbon or whiskey about once per week. Take it for what it's worth.",

   "Loved this tour! First off, be sure to make a reservation before as they have limited hours. Also, the ticket price ($10 per adult) includes a free tour at their bottling and warehouse facility in Cox's Creek. The tour lasted about an hour, included a short video about the history of the distillery and walk around the property. After, we went inside and saw the column stills and doubler pot still. My favorite part was seeing all of the old cypress fermentation tanks, with the opportunity to dip your finger in and try them all! The tour concluded with a tasting of their four products, Four Roses, Four Roses Small Batch, Four Roses Single Barrel, and Four Roses Small Batch Select. I enjoyed the Single Barrel and Small Batch Select the most, plus you get to take your tasting glass home! Big shout out to Eileen, she was our guide and did a fantastic job!",
   "Didn't have time to do a tour, so my brother and I decided to do a tasting since we were only familiar with the Single Barrel product that Four Roses puts out.\n\nEileen led our tasting of all four products and was great. Very informative with the history of Four Roses and also had a lot of knowledge on how each product is made and the different recipes that go in them. Great explanation on how and why each product differed on the nose, palate, and finish. Will ask for her when we come back to do the tour!",
   "After visiting an different distillery, I felt like this was an step down. The most frustrating thing was finding out that the tour was using headphones and microphones, which was fine because I was Deaf and can read lips but a lot of the tour were when the back of his head were facing us. Please add closed captioning/subtitle to the short video at the beginning of the tour and maybe an cheat sheet with numbers of the places we are stopping at and the fun facts that the guide talks about. Ideally I would love to work on creating an Deaf Awareness day where all the distilleries on the trail are interpreted.",
   "Four Roses is fabulous. They are unique and thoughtful. Any event you attend at Four Roses is worth your while. In fact I told my husband last night it\u2019s like a family at Four Roses. Everyone is friendly, helpful and always smiling. If you get the opportunity to meet Brent Elliott or Al Young they are both nice guys that gladly share their time and knowledge with you.",
   "We missed the walking tour, which is on the hour, so we opted for the taste of history (takes about 30 minutes). It was seven dollars to try four bourbons. As a nice added bonus, you get to keep the glass you use to taste.\n\nFred was very friendly and informative. He even went out of his way to find out what products were available in Australia for the couple that was visiting from there.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out this distillery."

   "Lots of play area for kids. The lines were long which is to be expected, but it was hard to deal with only because it was almost impossible to find out where the line was in the store. There were two different lines. Maybe 3. We had to ask a few customers where the line was before we found the end. Could use a bit more organization on super busy days like today. I love that they had baskets of sunscreen to use for those who forgot it and bubbles for smaller kids who couldn't quite play on all the different areas. My toddler loves the corn box and spent most of his time there. It was nice that it was shaded and had seats for parents to watch. We used the fall fun pass ($12 kids, $5 parents, under2 are free) which gave us access to the playground, hay ride, and corn maze. The hay ride (which doesn't feature any hay, which is nice) takes you out to the pumpkin patch and corn maze. Once you are there you are free to pick a pumpkin and when you get picked up there is a tent to weigh and pay for your pumpkins. 48\u00a2 a pound which is a pretty decent price I feel like. We spent about 5 hours there and we're worn out by the end of it. Worth the money and had a good time! Oh, and the apple cider and donuts were delicious!",

   "THIS A BEST PLACE FOR KIDS TO HAVE A GREATNESS OF FUN, A LITTLE BIT A WAY FROM  DOWNTOWN LEXINGTON. THE ROAD TO THERE, IS EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAN AND NOT CROWDED,  A QUIET PLACE FOR KIDS TO PLAY WITH MANY  GAMES AND FUN RIDES .\nTHE RESTAURANT IS VERY CROWDED, SO BRING YOUR OWN FOOD IF YOU ARE IN HURRY, OR JUST GET ON LINE EARLIER OR JUST BE PATIENT AND STAY ON THE LINE BECAUSE IT GOES FAST.\nBE THERE, ON TIME, AND PAY FOR YOUR  ADMISSION FEE, IS CHARGED FAIRLY BUT YOUR ARE NOT CAN GET IN  WITHOUT IT.\nTHE KIDS ARE VERY HAPPY AND DON'T WANT TO LIVE SO BE PREPARED FOR IT.",
   "I was visiting family in the Lexington area and they took me here.  What a lovely way to spend a fall day.  Pumpkins everywhere!  Delicious fudge! Great place to take the kids as there is a playground, a trampoline-like device and various other activities.   Plenty of parking."

   "This was a really cool stop I just wish I went there in the Spring or Summer when it was warmer. One thing you will notice right away is that the people working there are so ridiculously nice it's amazing. Also they have a really great indoor learning facility with live animals, fossils, bones, skins and more. The trails are really well pathed so even people with wheelchairs, crutches and walkers can enjoy it no problem. This is a wonderful way to get out of the car and stretch your legs and give the kids a way burn off some energy that's both entertaining and educational.",

If you\u2019re looking for something a little different in bourbon country yet still relaxing then this is a must do excursion! Can\u2019t wait to come back and do it again!",

They showed us lots of points of interest and catered to our 3 year-old's love of turtles by slowing down the boat so she could see them sunbathing. The boat was pristine and had all of the necessary safety equipment. I would highly recommend this adventure!",

Even though we had arrived on time and had time to look around and waited. People started running to the conductor to get inside. Even though the Conductor was \"Yelling Open AIR only\" people who started to arrive in first class tried to board the train. I paid for First class and I arrived 45 minutes before like it stated online. Before it started and had a few people try to move us out of the way. They should board people by time of arrival, let the people who have been waiting longer in the HEAT, get on first. It was 90 degrees today. Not to add, people need to switch sides/seats so other people can get a better view since the right side has all the views.",
   "We loved the ride (in the first class air conditioned car.  The only limitation of the entire experience is the fact that it seemed too short (and we understand the track is safe only so far).  However, the value for the price per person is exceptional.",
   "A nice Museum and about an hour or so train ride up to a closed bridge and back. Good place to spend some time and see some railroad memorabilia.",
   "Very enjoyable experience & fun for the whole family. Great bunch of volunteers working there, very friendly & informative about the trip as well. We will be back!",
   "It was fun with my family and my son absolutely loved the experience... Definitely recommend is good for autistic children or was with mine... The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the day we went we booked 1st class  but due to technical difficulties with the generator that runs the A.C we had to step down to second class. In no way was it their falt nor do I blame them the staff was real nice but it... The ride was enjoyable and you get to see some of the stables and stuff for the pure breed horses as well..."

Attended for their President's Day event and there was so much to do.  Great activities for the kids in each room with good interaction and a fun way to learn about history.",
   "Went there to see one of the authentic places that Mary Todd Lincoln grew up in. It did not disappoint. We were taken on a tour through the house and shown their amazing collection. The tour guide was knowledgeable and shared many details about the family history. Would recommend for any history buff looking for an interesting excursion in Lexington!",
   "This tour was so education and informational. The home is has furniture from the Todd family, passed down through the generations that eventually returned back to the family home, and other pieces from the time period. \n\nThe tour guides are very knowledgeable and happy to answer questions, even from the youngest guests on the tour.",
   "While in Lexington touring the University of Kentucky, My son and I, toured the Mary Todd Lincoln Home!  It was very interesting! Our tour guide was very informative and knowledgeable. The home, which contained beautiful relics  (many original) gave a sense of how life may have been back in those days! My favorite part was using the homes original staircase, and touching the stair railing which was  touched by Mary Todd Lincoln, and quite possibly Abraham Lincoln!",

   "Beautiful inside and out.  The garden is stunning when in full bloom, and the home tour is something every Lexingtonian should experience at least once.  A lot has been done to make the grounds more appealing in recent years, including all the giant steel sculptures, mulched walking paths, and other interesting art and exhibits.  They've also tried to attract different markets and age groups by offering events such as yoga on the lawn.  The employees are not the nicest you've ever encountered, which has dissuaded me from taking others on the tour, but there's so much to see that one aspect shouldn't deter you.  The grounds have lots of historic aspects, too.",
   "Great tour, but didn\u2019t realize not Henry Clay\u2019s house. It was torn down by son and rebuilt on same foundation. So, the same room, but not really. That said, still a very nice historic house.",
   "For history lovers, this is a very interesting place to see. I really enjoyed viewing the original coach Henry Clay used traveling back and forth to Washington. Seeing. Furniture from the 1800s and the beauty of the Mansion itself ensures a worthwhile trip! Make a point to check out the formal Garden!",
   "The grounds are a great place for my 3 year old to run around and discover nature. Unfortunately the tour is not suitable for kids her age. Too many boundaries and not interesting enough for her. Good for adults, though.",

   "Really nice sized aviation museum.  They have more planes than you would think.  Took my 5 year old daughter and her friend.  They loved seeing the planes, sitting in a helicopter, playing a flight sim game.  Perfect for an hour or two.  For the big kids, aka Dad, they have about 5 or 6 fighter jets and tons of planes from many different decades.  Most notably for me is a F-14 Tomcat.  It has been there since 2005, but it never gets old seeing one of the largest fighter planes ever made.  Truly amazing engineering.  Take a couple hours on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and check out the much overlooked Aviation Museum of KY, it's right by Bluegrass airport.  $10 adults, $7 6-17, under 6 free.  If you like aviation at any level, you won't regret it.",
   "A wonderful museum! My brother and I went and the staff was very knowledgeable and interested in talking to us about the planes. Had a wonderful time and loved the little plane earrings they sell!!",
   "Staff was extremely friendly and informative. Most of them are volunteers. It doesn't seem like they change the exhibits regularly. It was cool sitting inside of a Cessna 150 and a Bell helicopter. Many different types of aircraft and articles. Took about 1 hour to see everything if you take your time. Two separate rooms house all of the exhibits. Check it out!",
   "Interesting displays and great, knowledgeable staff. We'll be coming back!",
   "Happily surprised and really enjoyed this museum inside their is a helicopter and small airplane you can get inside and with working pressable buttons and you have to try the flight simulator. I also need to mention the very kind friendly knowledgeable employees working there."

I was also expecting a larger turnout of art vendors --so this was a little disappointing.  \nThe old house is beautiful and full of Kentucky history making it worth the entry fee and visit.",

   "My family was visiting from out of town and were looking to tour one of Kentucky's many distilleries. The other distilleries that we looked at were either booked or closed on Sundays. Luckily, we stumbled on Castle and Key. We arrived early and got drinks at the bar. The bartender (Jordan) was super friendly and obviously very knowledgeable. The drinks were excellent (coming from someone who doesn't normally drink gin.) The tour was a ton of fun. The distillery has such an interesting history behind it and our tour guide, Russell, was an excellent host. I would highly recommend Castle and Key and can't wait to try their bourbon once its ready.",
   "Fabulous place, authentic & true to their mission to preserve a beautiful storied site and produce high quality spirits to match.  Well worth the trip, a standout in an area with many tour options.  \n\nWe brought our family here today and did the 1.5 hour tour.  The tour was led by Richard and Russell and provided great insight into their spirit production and extensive access to the full site with history and insight into the preservation efforts.  The buildings were beautiful and almost stuck in time in the best way possible.  Their bar, event space, and welcome areas are gorgeous and were thoughtfully furnished.  They also have well designed outdoor spaces perfect for nicer weather.  We also were lucky enough to meet Rick Key, their resident rescue cat who is sweet and adorable - he is worth the ticket alone.   \n\nTheir team was passionate about the site\u2019s history and focus on quality spirits.  Everyone was very welcoming throughout our visit.  The tour finished with a very intimate and creative tasting of their vodka and gin - both were delicious and we typically do not enjoy clear spirits.  They have their first bourbon (fingers crossed) releasing in 2022.  Unlike other distilleries they are not releasing branded bourbon from other producers and are focusing solely on their own production with bottled in bond products - very promising things to come!",
   "I booked this experience for my girlfriend and I. We had a great time, our tour guide Tony was great and very knowledgeable. We met two other couples on the tour and we all had a great experience. We can\u2019t wait to come back in the spring when the weather is a little warmer. We heard there are talks of turning the old administration building into a hotel/bed and breakfast, and maybe even a rooftop bar! We hope to see progress on that the next time we come back. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a personalized distillery experience!",
   "A fantastic place to see... From the guided tour to the cocktails afterward, I would highly recommend it.  Suggest taking the 1 and 1/2 hour tour.  There is so much history steeped within the walls and on the grounds. This is definitely a place to go if you\u2019ve never been and/or to take visitors from out of town/State that are interested in bourbon, gin and vodka distilling.  There is also a lovely sunken Garden and much more to see and learn while being there!   Two thumbs up!!",
   "Tour host is the best I\u2019ve ever had.  Tour showed the  full circle that bourbon \ud83e\udd43 industry has taken.  To see the restoration of this property is amazing.   Future looks bright for this company. Best tour I\u2019ve ever done.  I\u2019ve almost finished entire bourbon trail and definitely suggest this  visit."

   "Absolutely amazing. Adults will appreciate it more than the kids but if they know the story they will love it as well. So much to see and so many people there trying to see it. You need to give yourself a couple of days to see everything without over tiring yourself and to assure you get to see it all.  The crowds can get large so reading the exhibits can be tricky that's a good reason to try to see it over a couple days instead of one long day.  Lines moved very quick to get in and on a shuttle to the Ark. Landscaping is awesome outside of the Ark providing several picture perfect photo shots. Handicap friendly.  The kids will get tired as it is allot to see. The small petting mini zoo like areas outside are very hot though with limited shade, small cramped areas for the animals to walk around in and little to no seating to rest your tired legs. The snack shops outside of the Ark were not open so cannot review those.  The Ark's gift shop is wonderful with so many options of things to purchase. Prices aren't cheap but neither is the quality of the items. A great place to visit but wear comfortable shoes, and pace yourself.",
   "Everything I thought it would be and more. This is a one-of-a-kind exhibit, a must-see. The park grounds are well-maintained, the staff is professional, friendly and helpful, and the guests are very friendly as well; everyone works together to keep the place clean and family friendly. I loved the buffet and really enjoyed the zoo. I would recommend this place for religious and non-religious people alike. Great place to take your family in Kentucky! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",
   "The most amazing experience. Well worth the money. I do highly recommend getting there first thing so you can truly enjoy everything they have to experience. Puts such an awesome realization of what Noah and his family were able to accomplish. Makes the Bible that much more real! \n\nI am planning on saving up to bring my children there. It is a once in a lifetime experience that should be experienced more than once!!!!",
   "This is definitely worth seeing in person. It\u2019s incredible that such a large ship could be built before modern day technologies and machines. I\u2019ll admit too, I didn\u2019t realize Noah had Dinosaurs on the ship. So many animals and so many different species. Its amazing Noah and his family could take care of all of them. It must have been exhausting for them. Not to mention, the smell they must have dealt with. \n\nWe visited during the off season so there were parts not open but the ship is the main attraction, so it didn\u2019t bother us that we only saw the ship. \n\nThe only thing that did disappoint us was the lack of food choices. Only the restaurant was open, which is a buffet and very expensive for someone who doesn\u2019t want a lot to eat. I would have rather spent money on food from the other spots where you can buy smaller portions cheaper. However, with that said, the buffet food was good. Not worth the money good though. \n\nAs a side note, we stayed at the Hampton Inn a couple exits away from the Ark. If you want somewhere to stay within minutes of this place, I highly recommend that hotel.",
   "It is a great place to take the family.  Walking into the Ark you get a wow factor just seeing how enormous it is.  They explain evolution vs. creation and give so much data explaining the two arguments.  It is very well done."

   "We visited yesterday, I mentioned that I was a teacher and had a student, who was a struggling reader and loved horses, so I pick up free reading material about horses for my classroom. She asked us if we could wait a minute, she returned with a host of various horse reading material and activities as a gift for my classroom! I can\u2019t wait to see the student\u2019s face. Thank you so very much.The museum is a wonderful place to visit and learn about this specific breed of horse. They currently are remodeling to bring even more wonderful educational exhibits and it is included in admission to the Kentucky Horse Park.",
   "I worked on the remodel so there wasn't much to see.",
   "Great place to spend a day or two.  Get close to some beautiful horses and explore the history behind our equestrian heritage.",
   "Cant wait for the remodel to be done! Great place nice staff and lots to do! A very nice place to stop especially if you love horses. Must see place even if your traveling through!",

   "We went here twice so far this winter to take my daughter and her friend ice skating.  You can skate for hour and a half for $15 and they furnish the skates. You have to park at the parking garage on Main Street and walk about 2 blocks to the park. They have a stand that sales hot chocolate and coffee and other snacks. Its downtown so it's well lighted and so is the parking garage.",
   "The atmosphere is great during the holiday season with the ice skating rink. The ice is a little rough since it is outside and not in a controlled space. If you are going to skate for the first time I would recommend doing the indoor version first.",
   "This park is awesome and well designed fot the community here. It reminded me of home in Chattanooga but they don't have a professional football stadium or baseball team. The Red's do come during off season to play there. So, much to do here, architecture, history, art etc. \nWhat's not to like",
   "Beautiful place! Love the fountains! \u2764\ufe0f We went too the tree lighting. They have an ice skating rink, hot cocoa, funnal cakes! Great time!",

   "I am not a big history buff nor an I into architecture, but after driving past this place numerous times, decided to take a tour.  What a fantastic attraction.  Our docent, Ron, was amazing. Full of fun stories and interesting facts.  I was surprised at how many kids were on our tour and they were fascinated by the stories Ron had to tell.  A beautiful property that is just going to get better over time and the renovations continue.  This mansion is massive and stunning.  Words nor pictures cannot do it justice.  I'm looking forward to going back to see the gardens in full bloom and then again at Christmas for the candlelight tour.",
   "Impressive and well worth a road trip. Kentuckys Ward Hall is amazing and they are trying to restore it to what it once was. Tours are by pre determined dates and extremely cheap at only $7 per adult. Highly recommend checking out and listening to the tours guides in depth knowledge of the history of the home and the people that called it home.",

   "Fantastic \"hole in the wall\" type restaurant. Found this after hitting a few stops on the bourbon trail. Excellent selection of bourbon and beer to go along with American-style food. We had the Spicy Burger, and it was great. Nice atmosphere with very friendly staff. Definitely check it out if you're in the Frankfort area.",

   "Serafini is one of my old favorites! I used to work in Frankfort over a decade ago and this used to be on the regular lunch rotation. It is one of the beat Italian restaurants in town in my opinion. Food is always fresh and delicious and this time around it didn't disappoint either. We were short on time and decided to head to Serafini for lunch. Service was great and the ambiance was perfect. The restaurant seemed immaculate too. I had the BBQ burger and my colleagues had the pork chop and the chicken salad sandwich. All the meals were delicious. We will definitely return when we are in town for work! Try it! You won't be disappointed!",

Pleasant to chat with, kept up with the drinks and kept us up to date with the progress of our lunch order.  The salad bar had a nice selection of fresh fruit and veggies.  Restaurant was clean and well maintained.",

   "Stopped in for an early lunch during a cold weekday. Being early, plenty of seating was available. I had a booth in the bar. Service was attentive and food (ordered from the lunch menu) was available fast. Rolls with cinnamon butter were great! The food (country fried steak with mashed potatoes) was exactly what I expected from a roadhouse. Only complaint is several people entered the bar directly from an exterior door, so my seating location was often met with a rush of cold air.",
   "We were immediately seated.. Our server was very friendly. We waited maybe about 15 min on our food which was great in service time and the product was awesome. I honestly have nothing bad to say about our visit."

   "Tried to call in an order and get an uber to pickup.  Pat was rude from the get go.  He was extremely impatient as I was asking for pad thai and wanted something else.  I apologized that I was not entirely prepared but had attempted to look at the menu online several times (in fact, even closed and reopened it and it's still just spinning an orange bulb).  I took the uber there to order in person (look at a menu).  He confronted me immediately asking if I was the person who called saying the website with the menu was down, I said yes.  He proceeded to tell me I was wrong and it was up and then pulled out his laptop to prove it to me.  I asked him not to argue with me at this point (I had checked multiple times and it wasn't).  I said I would just like to order.  Of which I then did.  I was given a ticket name \"BOSS LADY\" see the photo.  No spoon for my soup, no soy sauce had to ask for both.  Got back to my hotel and the soup was so clear, it really needed the soy sauce.  The pad thai, no sauce at all, no shaved carrots, not bean sprouts, not green onion.  Rice noodles, chicken and chopped peanuts.  Won't be going back there again.  Enjoy the attitude and fine cuisine.  Gross",
   "Red chicken curry was great.  Wife had paid thai- very good and a generous portion with lots of chicken.  Service was fast even though it was a busy Saturday night.  Constant stream of takeout customers too.  Can't wait to go back",
   "Please stop being so rude and yelling at your customers. It's not how you run a successful business. It's not their fault that they have not been there before and do not know your menu enough to make a decision within a minute of being there. Give them time to look it over. I have been here twice and had a bad experience both times. I heard the owner several times yelling at customers and making a scene in the restaurant. Yelling for things that is clearly not the customers fault, but in the mind of management, thinks he's always right. I do not want to give my business or money to someone who does that. It is embarrassing for the customer and looks terrible on him. I will not be returning."

The pizza takes a unique spin on NY Style while adding their own originality to it. The crust is flavorful, the cheese is fantastic (although a little greasy which you can expect when using FRESH mozzarella), and the sauce has a great balance to it as well. Check Buddy\u2019s out, your tastebuds will thank you for it!",
   "This is a great pizza shop! It's indie decor and simple layout remind me of a coffee house feel from my college days. Hand written chalkboard menu offers a great variety of food choices. \n\nA touch of oregano, combined with a unique style of sausage offered a great surprise for your taste buds. The sausage was not your run of the mill store bought meat. This was very tasty without any extra spice.\n\nBe sure to stop in when you can.",

I wish there were free refills and better (any) table service but I willingly sacrifice this for the pizza. Go here and go often and get the big bear. You can thank me later.",

It's not that dirty dumpy style pizzeria you would think of out of small places.  It's clean and smells good.  They have a good draft beer selection and the food speaks for itself.  Seriously.  Read that again.  The food speaks for itself.  We tried the Garlic knots and made our own pepper pizza with all the different types of peppers available.  The crust is from a fresh dough, the sauce is perfect and not too acidic.  The cheese is one of few times you'll get a good cheese pull and the flavor of everything together is nothing short of a flavor explosion in your mouth.  I hope they expand soon!",
   "The best pizza I have had in forever.  We tried the Masterpiece.   Perfect description of this pizza.  Everything thing was so fresh.  You have won me over. I have now found my favorite pizza restaurant.  Can't wait until you can open your doors and we can eat in.   I put my email address on the bottom of my receipt, hope to hear from you.",
   "I'll preface this by saying that I visited when we were about a month into the quarantine time, so normal life business might be different. My fiance ordered from here through a delivery service, and he said it was delicious but slow. Thinking it might have been the fault of the delivery service, we decided to try doing a pick up order. We called, ordered, and were told it would be 30 minutes. That was fine by us. We arrived at the store after 30 minutes had passed. The sign on the door said to call and get in line, so we got in line and called to tell them that we had arrived to pick up the pizza we had ordered. The girl on the phone seemed really confused, and after a few minutes said that someone would come out to give us the pizza. We took that to mean get out of the line and wait in front of the door. After another 10 minutes of sitting in front of the store, I went to the door and waved. A server brought a pizza to the door, but when he opened the door, all he had to say was that he was looking for Nancy and that he would have to help me later. I returned to my car, and we waited another 20 minutes while watching the server bring pizza to other cars sitting in front of the store. At this point, we had waited an hour for pizza that was supposed to be ready in 30 minutes, and we had no idea if we were waiting in the right spot or not. We ended up leaving. An hour and a half after we placed the order, I received a text from a number that wasn't the store number saying that our pizza was ready.  Maybe it's just that they haven't figured out their curbside system or that they were unusually busy, but I wouldn't have minded waiting if the store had simply communicated with us about the wait time or where to wait.",
   "DaVinci's is a bit of a splurge for us, but definitely worth it!  It has has quickly became my favorite pizza place by far.  We've gone multiple times and have not been disappointed yet.  Good crust, good sauce, good toppings - just really, really good pizza.",
   "Pleasant local business, decent pizza, comfortable and usually great service.  Specials are up on a chalk board in the corner, so those of us with glasses have trouble seeing.  Owner seems nice and responsive to the community."

   "The margarita here is probably the worst tasting margarita I've ever had. The bartender never even gave me a menu so I looked it up online. She seemed more interested in talking to guy at the bar while ignoring everyone. The tacos were pretty good with plenty of steak on them, 2 stars because of the tacos.",
   "The first salsa they brought out with the chips had no heat whatsoever, and had sugar in it?  Who does that? I asked for a hotter salsa and it was very good. The guacamole isn't really guacamole... it's just mashed avocado. The steak was very tender and had a great flavor, but the dish itself had too much salt in it. Nice atmosphere, friendly and good service.",
   "called in an order for pickup. Waited over 30 minutes in the parking lot before asking someone about my order. He said if we haven't brought it out, it's not ready. Rude little guy. I left and went elsewhere. Trying support local businesses during the pandemic, but I won't support this place ever again.",
   "Food was good...but service was terrible.  We got a la carte chimichanga ... 2 ea...she charged us a fortune...our bill for 2 was $40.  Instead she could have charged the meals for half the price.  She was rude as well and didn't refill or check on us at all.  We always eat here with our huge family and get treated much better.  I will not eat here again unless with big family.",
   "My first time at this restaurant and I was quite disappointed. The salsa had a bean after taste with little flavor which I don't like. The beans were bland and can tell from a can. The rice had no flavor and was mushy. Food here very bland and over priced. The service was ok but they could be more helpful and friendly. Over all it was ok but I won't be back that's for sure."

Last night we ordered China Wok rice and egg rolls and it was so salty and greasy...not the way it usually tastes. Tonight we ordered chicken cashew din and sesame chicken. No sesame seeds and completely wrong sauce. It tasted more like Gen Tso. No cashews in the cashew din. Called and talked to owner who offered to remake it if we brought it back to them tonight which we did even though we don't live close. She then said we did have the correct order but that they forgot the sesame seeds and cashews. Did not hold up her offer to remake it nor offer our money back. My husband had to ask for some cashews on the side. We get back home and are not satisfied. Called and talked to her again. She pretty much said my husband was lying about not having sesame seeds and the wrong dish. He just had sesame chicken a few days ago and this was NOT the same dish.  She apologized but still no offer to refund our money or comp a future dinner. This is not how to treat customers esp when they patronize your establishment often. Completely unacceptable and particularly offensive when we give you our business during the current pandemic.  Dinner was trashed, and we will not be going back.",

The special pork with egg rolls was great and added that whole container of fish sauce made it even better.  The chicken curry was so tasty nice stong curry flavor the way it should be. My only negative is that this place is not closer to our house. We would be here every day. Love it",

   "Mai Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant. First thing we noticed was a faint smell of cigarettes or something cooking that smelled like cigarettes. No one in the restaurant was smoking. Over priced for what you receive in my opinion. Bowls or fried rice from 9.50 and 11.50. The fish sauce for the bowls was delicious, with just the right amount of spice. Bowls have noodles, meat, nuts, and lettuce with thin egg rolls. So the bad. In 10 minutes of leaving restaurant I became very sick with with an upset stomach, you can use your imagination, but it was bad. One other that had a bowl became sick. Others were ok, that had fried rice. So I will give a three and assume the food just did not agree with my stomach.",
   "This is a cozy spot for lunch or dinner (or takeout)! I love all their phos - the beef is now my favorite, but whenever I'm not feeling great I love to get their spicy Korean chicken soup. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. One of my two favorite restaurants in Frankfort."

Didn't get my biscuits or cornbread which was supposed to come with my roast beef meal.  Server just brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  Now I understand when it's busy you try to move your diners out so you can seat the next ones but the customers next to us had already finished their meal when we were seated and didn't order anything else, they were just sitting and talking which is fine. Ordered dessert.  Came with the smallest scoop of ice cream on the planet.  Is rather eat at Denny's or Waffle House.",

In a matter of 3 weeks I\u2019ve probably spent $75 there. And all I want is my order replaced and he couldn\u2019t even do that? I will NOT go back.

   "Love the Chicken Baleadas, even though I can only eat part of one and take the rest home. \nMy husband had the Mami Monchitas Family Sampler and loved it. Had to Yale part of his home as well. \nThe Mango Margarita\u2019s are amazing!",
   "The menu is outstanding (authentic, as best I can tell).  The food is outstanding. The service is outstanding.  That's all  that needs to be said. Highly recommend this restaurant.",
   "The food was delicious! It was my first visit and our host was very welcoming and shared lots of information about the food. Definitely going back. Margarita was delicious too!!!",
   "Let me start by saying that if you have not been here and you are debating this place among any other, you absolutely have to go here. \n\nThe food is absolutely phenomenal. The service was impeccable. The margaritas were delicious. This place is easy to find, but off the beaten path. I'm willing to bet everything on the menu is delectable.\n\n12/10 must try.",
   "This place is awesome really good food and service. Will be eating there again."

   "Some damn good chicken, yes that good. Perfectly cooked, good size wings (both traditional and boneless) plenty of flavor from the sauces. Will for sure return for more delicious chicken wings",
   "I had their traditional Buffalo wings and I thought they were going to be breaded but mine weren't and the perfect amount of heat. My husband got the sweet chili and they were way better than Asian zing at Bdubs. Got a sample of the corn nuggets and they were amazing. Excited that Frankfort has a great place for our wings.",
   "Wing only joint; I was hoping they'd have some chicken tenders but they do offer boneless wings!  You can get them tossed in sauce or on the side. We ordered Garlic Parmesan and BBQ.  We got our wings tossed in sauce.  The chicken was juicy, the wings weren't hard, and they had the perfect coating of sauce. Ranch sauce tasted homemade - we'll definitely be back!\n\nAnd for the germaphobes, inside was clean. The cashier handled money but not the food. The cook wore gloves and she didn't touch cash/her face.",
   "Really good chicken with a nice variety of flavors and styles. Cooked to order, but certainly worth the wait!",
   "I had my first experience with the Chicken Koup today and left very satisfied. Currently, the Chicken Koup is best suited for online, mobile, and drive-thru orders, however I ate inside. There were only two seats at a bar, but that was perfect for my friend and I. We ordered onion rings, corn nuggets, a small order of boneless wings (8 count) and a small order of traditional wings (5 count). The boneless wings were great--no gristle or fatty parts. They were well-sized. The traditional wings are marinated or brined in seasonings for 24 hours, and you could tell. We tried the Koup Sauce (a Mayo based, tomato-like, special sauce), the Teriyaki sauce, the Sweetyaki sauce (a combo of Sweet Chili & Teriyaki), and the hot sauce (which I found most compatible to Louisiana brand hot sauce). All were great. Next time, I think I'll try the lemon pepper rub.\n\nService was excellent. The two ladies working inside were very helpful with the menu. All of our food was cooked fresh. I noticed their Health Inspection Score posted on the wall was 100. I work in Downtown Frankfort and had no trouble getting in and out on a one hour lunch break. If I were with more than just one other person, I would recommend ordering online and picking up inside or drive thru just to save yourself time. This is a new establishment, and I hope the East Frankfort/KSU community continue to show them some love."

   "I\u2019m on the road a lot and use chili\u2019s as my go-to restaurant so I\u2019ve been to many different locations in different states and this one just didn\u2019t meet the bar. When I walked in they didn\u2019t have anyone seating people which happens but someone is always eventually on it, so I stood at the podium and waited for someone to come over but no one ever did. After several minutes of standing there not sure what the deal was and making eye contact with multiple servers who didn\u2019t say anything, I continued to wait and look around while being completely ignored (there was no rush, the building was less than half full, and one waitress was actually sitting at a table hanging out with friends it appeared she was serving). Eventually I walked to the back and caught a server and asked if it was seat yourself even though there was no sign and none of the other chili\u2019s I\u2019ve been to are like that and a waitress answered \u201cyea\u201d without looking at me. Luckily the server I got was a very nice man who earned these two stars on his own but when the food came it just wasn\u2019t good - and it\u2019s a dish I\u2019ve had before and really liked. It was disappointing for a chili\u2019s experience.",
   "Very  poor  service.  If you  was  known  by them than  you  were  great.  We wasn't  and the waitress wouldn't  even  look  are way. Was sitting  with  people  she  new. The bartender  was  so busy  I appreciate  him checking  on  us. We really  should  have  left.  Won't  go back. Food was also  cold.",
   "Chili's offers a menu for most tastes including limited vegetarian. The prices are reasonable and it has daily specials. The wait staff is courteous and attentive. I have found a turnover in staff but perhaps that's indicative of the industry. This restaurant is clean despite being understaffed at times."

They truly care about having quality ingredients, which translates into quality food.\n\nIt also helps that Megan is as attentive as she is. She brought out extra gravy for our biscuits.

   "First time diner:  Ordered the veggie omelette.  Very good and cooked perfectly. The accompanying hash browns were also very good. Food was served quickly and was piping hot. Pleasant staff. A solid choice for breakfast and I presume lunch and dinner as well. I\u2019ll be back.",
   "Road tripping through Frankfort and found this little gem! Nice location in downtown Frankfort. Cute diner with good diner-type fare. To hear Megan talk about her passion for making food is a real treat! I'd definitely go back if I was in Frankfort again.",
   "My wife and I had dinner on their opening night. Both of us ordered the meat loaf special. We both found it outstanding, as were the onion rings and mini salmon patties we ordered as appetizers. This is the same ownership as the Riverboat Grill a couple blocks away. They are open from 7 am to 9 pm seven days a week.",

   "All right I gave this restaurant a 5-star because of the way the manager on duty handled my problem even though it didn't happen on his shift. I had gotten 2 giant fish sandwiches from here at lunch time and asked for them to be plain and even though the receipt said plain when I got back to the office with my lunch they both had lettuce and tartar sauce on them. I called spoke with the manager on duty at that time, his name was Jared, he told me to bring them back that he would be glad to fix me fresh. When I got to the restaurant Jared wasn't there but the other manager was on duty (I didn't get his name sorry), but he was wonderful in fixing my problem and I will return to this restaurant cause I do love Captain D's fish and the great service!! Thank you for taking time to read this. \ud83d\ude01",

They were very busy.  Being a former manager of Long John Silver's,  I could appreciate the problem. \n The restaurant is  clean . People friendly.  \n Glad to see the new one opened on East side of town. Looking forward to trying it out.",

The floors were super sticky and hard to walk on, to the point of sounding and feeling like pulling velcro apart. The food looked absolutely nothing like the pictures. The bread on our Frisco breakfast sandwich was touching, as though there was basically nothing on the sandwich. This is the most disappointing, because they have a huge picture advertising it on the menu board. To top things off, the outside of the wrappers were extremely greasy, defeating the purpose of something to keep your hands at all clean. \nDisappointing to say the least.",

One of the best Hardee's restaurants we have been to I completely give Bryann that win though he went above and beyond for customer service to me and my wife just passing through never seen him before in our lives but treated like family elders !!!!

   "I came here with my papaw a lot before moving to Utah. The food is great. It\u2019s closest place you can get home cooking food in Frankfort Kentucky. The staff is like family to you. Highly recommend."

   "I was in the area checking out a couple distilleries, didn\u2019t see this location on the map and happened to found it as we were walking by. The burger was really juicy and good! I had the Beer Cheese and Bacon Burger with a side of Tatertots. I had an Bourbon Barrel Stout which was amazing as well.",
   "Our server was polite and attentive (trystin?) Our food came hot fresh and quick. Prices are very reasonable for the portions. Only complaint would be extra parking...not extremely difficult to find but could use a sign or something.",
   "Great spot downtown on the river! Looking forward to coming back when it's warm out to sit on the deck overlooking the river. Space was welcoming with plenty of seating.
