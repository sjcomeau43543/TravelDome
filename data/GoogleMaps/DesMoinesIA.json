   "Nicely sized zoo. Open all year round with fun events. Zoo brew on Wednesday nights let you check out the animals up close with a drink in hand. Fun times!",
   "This is a great local zoo!      There are lots of exhibits to see, but it can still be covered in a couple of hours.\n\nWe visited on a mild winter day, and it was fantastic.    There was no crowd, and many of the animals were still active.   (Even the flamingos.)     There is a great indoor area and plenty of indoor viewing areas scattered outside to warm up in when needed.\n\nBe sure to visit Barnaby, the ~80 year old tortoise.      He was very active despite his age, walked up to greet us, and began playing with a ball.     Amazing!",
   "Great zoo. Even in the winter they have animals to see. I love that it is small enough to visit in about an hour. I don't need to be stuck halfway through a zoo with a tired 3 year old.",
   "It is a small zoo, but well worth seeing. My sister and I took her kids and we had a blast looking at all the animals. Especially the red  panda.",
   "Great zoo. Lots of well planned patches and exhibits. Not too large yet not a little hole in the wall zoo either."

   "The Botanical Garden has many different plants and activities. Take a class, listen to live music, complete crafts, or plant your own garden. Check their calendar for upcoming events. There are always staff or volunteers ready to answer questions you may have. They have classrooms open with activities for children to do. They offer guided tours on the weekend, or just take the time to walk on your own.",
   "Absolutely, completely LOVE this place. There were families playing Uno on the upper deck, children \"hunting\" for certain plants on a scavenger hunt, and people quietly sitting, reading a book while they absorbed the warmth, humidity, and light. This has become one of my favorite winter Iowa destinations, especially due to my \"winter blues\". It's an inexpensive therapy! Also, check out the back room. It's well hidden and lovely as well.",
   "So much fun!! It was so pretty, and a great way to escape snowy Iowa for a day!! The plants and flowers were gorgeous. Loved learning about the plants, it was educational yet super fun. It had great places for younger children to learn. It was very clean, and the volunteers/staff were extremely friendly!! Can't wait to go again!!!",
   "The plants all look cool. The inside is always larger in my memory, but there's plenty more around the perimeter. The views here are amazing as one would expect by the river and inside a gigantic glass dome. Check it out",
   "I grew up going to the Botanical Center and I was so glad to come back to some beautiful updates to the facility. It is open all week (including weekends) from 10 am - 5 pm. There's so much veriety in the main garden and interesting fun facts. The waterfall is always wonderful and relaxing to sit next to and the upper balcony has been updated as well (some water drops from condensation). The original display from the front entrance is next to the bathrooms along with some really beautiful artwork. Tucked back by the orchids is a beautiful greenhouse display where there are a million photo opportunities."

   "So glad that Des Moines has this space. Nice local restaurants close by as well. Nice to take an hour with the kids for something to do. And it is free looks all day everyday!",
   "This place is incredible. Year round it looks nice, and the park keeps expanding with the space it has. It doesn't take much time to go through the entire park, but it makes a beautiful place to take food from the surrounding restaurants, or a nice place to read something from the nearby library. Speaking of which, everything surrounding the park is full of character and makes for a top notch experiance."

She is very kind and she has got a great knowledge of the history. I enjoyed and I got to explore a bunch of new things that I had never done till now. Thank you! I highly recommend people to visit the beautiful place. You will have wonderful experience!",
   "It's pretty good as far as capitals go. The gold is a nice touch with a lovely rotunda. It could use some updates as well as a better visitor entrance. The entrances are kind of hidden and appear as an afterthought, almost as if they are just stuck in wherever they fit instead of thinking of the visitor experience. Merchandise is reasonably priced but lacking in diversity of items.",
   "Wonderful tour of the Iowa State Capitol with the Ray Society. One of the painters (restoration artists) explained how they have restored the plaster and painted walls throughout the bldg. Very impressive. Beautiful wood carvings, mosaics tile floors  and carpets. Dana was an excellent tour guide. Very knowledgeable about Iowa history. Only 5 domed capitol bldg in US and covered in gold leaf.",
   "Beautifully preserved architecture throughout the Iowa State Capitol building. House of Representatives chambers are massive. Library is truly one-of-a-kind must see. Staff is gracious and welcoming. Great place to visit... just make sure to LOOK UP!!",
   "The Capitol was a great experience. We had two little ones with us so we didn\u2019t take the guided tour but we were still able to see almost everything. It has enough exhibits and things inside the building that you and the kids won\u2019t get bored. If you want to go up to the highest levels of the gold dome then you need a tour guide but other than that you can basically do everything yourself. There are a ton of neighboring sites adjacent to the grounds as well as a gorgeous view of the city from up above, a rare site in flat Iowa. Definitely glad we took the time to go, it\u2019s something we will return to visiting when the weather warms up."

   "Such an amazing farmers market! We would drive 30 min every week to go, its huge and has everything. Must try croissants or scones and bread at La Mie, or a breakfast burrito and some coffee! It's got everything: produce, canned salsa/jams, cheese, wine, meats, honey, juice, bakeries, arts and crafts, music, dog treats, and so much more. It's clean, safe, tons of entertainment, and port-o-potties for families/littles. Great location in the middle of restaurants (as if u couldn't find deliciousness at the market itself), can walk the bridge across the river. Best farmers market we've ever been too, and we've lived in 9 states.",
   "Fantastic. Great place to walk around and interact with a wide group if people. From crafts, plants, food and everything in between. Was able to sample a lot of new food and took some home. Had some great stuffed fill pickles. There was beautiful music of all types. Everyone should check it out when ever possible. Truly amazing.",
   "I love the November and December Farmer's Market. Though I preferred the previous location, the 2019 market iwas very enjoyable. It would be 5 stars if they would limit strollers to umbrella type. Most parents were carrying children and using strollers as grocery carts.1 family had a stroller baby/bed combo the size of big box store grocery cart.",

   "I must say that the museum is exceptional and wonderful.  The atmosphere is incredibly calm and relaxed which allows you to appreciate all the pieces calmly and in your time.  The attention of the staff in all the rooms was first class, the ladies I asked for recommendations and information went beyond a simple instruction, which is quite appreciated because it shows that the staff loves their workplace.  The variety of pieces in the permanent exhibitions is amazing with pieces by international artists such as Picasso.  It has a restaurant inside the museum which allows you to enjoy a snack during your visit.  My recommendation is that you go on Thursdays as they close until late and it gives you the opportunity to observe the whole complex calmly.  Best of all, all this wonder is free!  So it is definitely a must-see gem when visiting Des Moines.\n\nDebo decir que el museo es excepcional y maravilloso. La atm\u00f3sfera es incre\u00edblemente tranquila y relajada lo que te permite apreciar todas las piezas con calma y a tu tiempo. La atenci\u00f3n del personal en todas las salas fue de primer nivel, las se\u00f1oritas a las que les pregunt\u00e9 recomendaciones e informaci\u00f3n para poder observar mejor las exposiciones fueron m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de una simple instrucci\u00f3n, lo que se aprecia bastante porque se nota que el personal ama su lugar de trabajo y se agradece una atenci\u00f3n sincera y amable. La variedad de piezas en las exposiciones permanentes es incre\u00edble contando con piezas de artistas internacionales y del nombre de talla como Picasso. Tiene un restaurante dentro del museo lo que te permite disfrutar de alg\u00fan aperitivo durante tu visita. mi recomendaci\u00f3n es que acudas en los jueves ya que cierran hasta tarde y te da la oportunidad de observar todo el complejo con calma. Lo mejor de todo es que toda esta maravilla es \u00a1gratis! as\u00ed que definitivamente es una joya imperdible al visitar Des Moines.",

I was so taken by the art I almost touch it but you're not supposed to. Do not touch I felt like a kid when the attendee warned me.  I really had a great time walking around on each floor it's a maze within its self.  Really cool for any occasion.  #BUTTAFLIBEST1AWARD \ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udfc6",
   "Such an underrated place.\n\nShowcases popular artists like Pablo Picasso, John Singer Sargent, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Grant Wood.\n\nAdmission has been free recently.

   "This is a stunning place with amazing art as well as architecture and architectural craftsmanship. We visited today, Nov 12 and we went for the first tour. We had a wonderful and knowledgeable guide and we were the only ones there! A private tour! The guided tour is worth the extra expense as you will see more of the home and you will have docent guided tour with background and additional information. Whether you like textiles, paintings, pipe organs (amazing), sculpture or woodworking, you will delight in this amazing home. And we went with very cold weather and it was toasty warm! You will have stairs to climb. And there is parking. I cant say much about the gardens as it was all covered in a beautiful blanket of snow. This is a must see for locals and visitors. Enjoy!",
   "Beautiful home built in the 1920s designed to reflect the architecture and feel of a manor seen in Salisbury UK. The home is furnished worn some replicas and some authentic 16th century architecture and furnishings. Some of the paintings on the wall are quite gorgeous. Tours of the full house are only offered three times a day, but you can pay $8 to walk around the first floor only. I opted to self guided tour which ended up being very few rooms and the front garden.",
   "Phenomenal. Any one who loves history, England, or beauty should check it out. I was blown away. The story of the home and how it came to be is incredible to me. People with incredible sums of money these days would never build anything so amazing. A very unique find in the middle of Iowa.",
   "I've always adore this place since I was a child and my mother would take me. Fun half day activity for children 12 and up. Great little piece of history to partake in. Always great to go back for a visit. I recommend always looking at the website for time and date information though, because they do events that may interfere with regular business hours. If your ever in Des monies I highly recommend.",
   "We went to Mysteries at the Castle and had a great time with three of our kids. It was beautiful, fun and festive. The historic backdrop was delightful to show the kids and imagine with them how we would live there if it was our home. Will return to see the House when it is not a \"Castle\" :)"

   "It is informative, but read Desert. It's available for free online and can be accessed easily. This should be renamed to the Norman Borlaug BJ museum for what this really is. It feels far too much like it wants to celebrate billionaire philanthropy, US imperial hegemony, all packaged as if they're objective facts. \"Norman Borlaug saved 1,000,000,000 lives. Wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans feed the most people across the world. The United States must accept a paternalistic role in the developing world.\"",
   "Wow! Beautifully restored old library. It is a museum and a hall of fame honoring the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. If you are into architecture this $29.8 million restoration project is definitely worth seeing!  The museum, located in the basement, is informative.  On the upper level there is a art room displaying works that relate to those that are honored in the Hall of Fame.  It is only open to the public on Tuesdays and Saturdays, but it is free.  I understand you can arrange a private tour on some other days during the week.  Located on the river, it is a must see if you are in Des Moines.",
   "Amazing building, wonderful story about growing food! I'm picky, but I can't say enough about this place! [I'm straight A in 3rd World Social Development & Change (Sociology/Socioeconomics - UCSB)] I just happened to be renting a studio apt across the street. Lived there for two years before I even noticed the place!  When I visited it the experience was paranormal it was such a coincidence. Like I was brought there by some spirit or something. Amazing gardens and landscape with lots of rabbits and the Des Moines River flowing behind it. I witnessed people catching and cleaning Alligator Gar fish off the bridge. You never see this in CA where I'm from. Best experience for me in Iowa, so far was the World Food Prize Hall.",

   "This is a nice walk and a suprisingly pleasent area.  Only 3 stars because Des Moines and much of the USA have this weird idea of isolating things rather than complimenting things.  This walk and the Asian park are isolated from other things.  In my humble opinion, the road the goes along the park near the Botanical center should accommodate businesses and shops.  A place to get a bite or a drink and/or some shops.  Its essentially a desert.  \n\nYou drive there.  You park.  You walk. That's it.  There is no place to get a bite or to shop.  Typical American desert of a park.",

   "A fairly recent artsy installation on the western bank of the Des Moines River in downtown Des Moines, right next to the western entrance to the iconic Iowa Women of Achievement Bridge.  When it first opened, there were a few more swings installed on the fishing pole, but when I visited this time, there was only one lonely swing left.  The park is nicely lit at night and adds a more \"fun\" element to the river front space in downtown."

I really amaze at the architecture and designed of this place. Walking distance to botanical garden, women of achievement bridge, rotary riverbank park. I hope we raise enough fund to fix this place and get the ponds to work properly with Iowa weather. I think it's will look a lot better with the ponds and waterfalls completed.",
   "Cool place to pull over and walk through. The pagoda is quite beautiful and affords a scenic view of the city across the river.",
   "I'm sure it was beautiful at one time, but it's in a bit of disarray. With cleanup and straightening on the items in the garden in would be really nice. The location on the river is great.",
   "It's a very pretty scenery to walk by on. But the river definitely worth walking by and viewing and makes for a pleasant walk. Also close to some other items to explore as well. May need some maintenance and weeding should be done but it was around fall areas and it wasnt bad. Overall the actual area is  cleaned and pretty.",
   "Such a surprise to fin. Lovely little park to walk through. Peace and tranquility"

   "Definitely a fun location to take all ages during the summer.  They have rides for nearly anyone and they have a waterpark on-site.\n   If you can afford to spring for the cost of Adventureland Inn and plan on staying the night it's worth it.  The trolley to and from the park that runs every 15 minutes or so is great.  You also save on parking doing it that way. The hotel has 2 pools and a sports bar inside that offers a great, affordable breakfast.  It's also a solid place for dinner but obviously there's cheaper hotels in the area.  But also plan ahead because the rooms can fill up fast.\n   Since it's not one of the bigger parks the lines are typically much shorter.  Shorter lines make for a much better experience without having to pay extra for fast passes to get a quick line wait time.  This is definitely our goto amusement park but once our kids are a bit older we'll probably venture to a more exciting location with bigger attractions.  For younger kids Adventureland is great though.  I cant imagine the impatience in contrast.",
   "Enjoy and hang on. Love the live shows, wave pools and slides. The Monster is worth the wait and the Phoenix was so much fun.  I would recommend buying your tickets online though because you can usually save a little money and you don't have to wait in line for tickets. The lockers for rent are very small, far to small to be practical.  I wouldn't have thought of amusement park as event space, but it was pretty cool being on the park grounds without a trillion other people. They have added a racetrack with mechanical horses that goes around a track.",
   "I stay over. So hang at the wave pool then get some eats and back to the room come out later enjoy walking around and maybe hit a ride or 2. Prices are right and look for the coupons. Advetureland in consistent and friendly great staff.",
   "Went with a group of four for the day. We had a lot of fun and got a chance to do almost everything. I do wish they would open a few ride for adults who dont love huge rides. My wife gets sick on roller coasters and feels she can only ride baby ride with the lack of other options. I hope they see this and maybe look into one for adults that's not so extreme.",
   "The best destination for fun in the sun and thrills. Close to hotels shopping and Casino.  Save on parking by parking at hotel and riding the free shuttle.  Pack a picnic lunch for a mid day break. Enjoy and hang on.  Love the live shows, wave pools and slides.  Great family fun with discounted tickets at local grocery stores"

   "The architecture and design of the building are interesting, the expositions inside the museum are simple but good and, if you read the information, you can learn something new about Iowa.",
   "Wide variety of exhibits, from war memorabilia, to movies filmed in the state and more modern events, as well as history on the states expansion and development. Lots of history and items relating to the civil war, including personal effects of generals and soldiers who were from Iowa. Admission to the museum is free and there is a cafe located on the third floor.",
   "Many interesting expositions about the history and culture in Iowa from various historic periods. Free entrance was a surprise.",
   "I hadn't been here since I was a kid--what a mistake! My wife and son and I were just enthralled with the in-depth exhibits covering coal mining (as you walk through an elaborate coal mine), the Civil War, and the pre-European history of Iowa and much more. The Civil War exhibit really affected me; it really showcased the personal costs of the war. I will have to come back on my own to spend a day going through everything more thoroughly. We went with a big group of kids (ages 3-11) for 2 hours, and they had a great time as well."

To sit and watch the large number of feeders draw birds of all kinds, sizes, colors and with unique calls. Just give yourself a gift. Hike the trails, watch the birds and calm yourself.",
   "The lodge is beautiful and can be rented for events. There are plenty of camp sites with power. The hiking trails are well maintained and offer views of the Racoon River. This is my favorite cross country skiing place after fresh snow. I would also say this is the best first day hike, as the snacks, hit cocoa, and REI folks are fantastic! A boat ramp is available and there are two entrances, with plenty of parking along the park drive. The newer playground features a rock with climbing, swings, sand, however it's in the sun and quite hot in the summer.",

It's a relatively well known spot for photographer's looking to get an image of Boston and it doesn't disappoint. It's a great park, well worth a walk around. If you park in the lot and you plan on getting a sunset photo, be careful, they do lock the gates after dark.",
   "This park amazed me! It is so lovely. My children ages 3 and 4 absolutely LOVED it. This was one of those parks I had to bribe them to leave. There is parking and restrooms. They also have beautiful walking trails and after playing on the park we took a nice walk just the 3 of us and our pup love. My children made it through the entire trail and loved it. I left my phone and was a little nervous but felt safe enough to walk through the trail with kids. Not being from the area makes me nervous to go on hikes without my husband but here we felt safe and the beautiful hand built bridges over little water ways and an easier trail to take for the kids and I. Will definitely go back!",
   "The kidlettes love this park.  It is highly maintained and the traffic (child count) stays relatively low.  It is the perfect park for kids of the younger sizes 2-5 and for bigger kids too 6-9ish. Bathroom facilities, swings, acres of manicured fields, local biking trails in/near the nearby woods, and disc golf adjacent the property.  There is a smaller secondary park across the highway (geared toward 4+) that is a great overflow playground, field, parking, etc.  \n\nIn the early mornings the park is usually very clean.  The ground crew mow early and frequently and are usually done by about 9am or so.  Occasionally a raccoon or two will get in the garbage, but very very rare.  Not a ton of seating , so bring a chair or blanket.  Also, if anyone reading this happens to have a spare plastic steering wheel, the park is missing two child's play steering wheels.\n\nOh hey, almost forgot; on one occasion,  someone dumped a truck load of used tires in the nearby creek adjacent the pedestrian bridge.  Not an issue that is too alarming for the Southside of DSM, but I here is the kicker; on a separate occasion (unrelated), open alcohol containers and an alarming number of crushed pills and residue were left on the green table under the walkway.   So that's a thing .\nMosquitoes too.\n\nLastly, make sure to assess the stacked hexigons as they accumulate water after rainfall.  Just FYI.\n\n99% of the time this park is great.

I did purchase a bottle to enjoy at home.",

   "As a group, we felt completely unwelcomed and rushed through the tasting. Had to keep reminding server that we hadn't been served from the bottle she was rushing to put away. Samples were served in plastic cups, and the amount was so small it barely covered the bottom of the cup - very difficult to give it a good sniff or 2-3 sip tasting! Personally did not enjoy any of the wines (whites/ros\u00e9s very sweet). First winery visit (of many) where I chose not to purchase a bottle(s). Outdoor grounds pretty, good sized patio."

   "It's sad to watch a snowman melt... and messy.  Even so there were a few hearty Iowans attempting to enjoy the remnants of winter at Sleepy Hollow in spite of the slush and mud.  The workers I encountered were friendly.  The chalet looks nice.  Given another 12 inches of snow it might be worth the price.",
   "I would say five stars, except that it cost sixty-nine bucks just for me and my Daughter to get through the gate.  That left me with very little cash for vendors.  Neither the event nor most of the vendors take credit cards.  If the park took credit cards (or charged a reasonable amount at the gate) I could have used my cash to buy souvenirs. I have several Friends who bend at Sleepy Hollow and they didn't make much (partially because of the turn-out, probably due to weather, but also because they charge exhorbitantly for vendor space, too).  Otherwise, it was a five star experience.\n\nSuggestion:  Let vendors vend outside of the gate in the space between the bridge and the entrance and/or in the parking lot just before the bridge, too & charge them like half the amount.  That way patrons could shop on the way in and out...",
   "I think Sleepy Hollow is awesome, especially for Iowa (we really don't have too many places like this so it's very nice). In the winter, you can go snowboarding or tubing down their huge hill with a lift that takes you back up. They have go-cart racing, mini-golf, and many other fun family activities!! I'm excited to go back out there to experience anything new. \nThey also have events for holidays and such. One event I will be attending every year is the Renaissance Faire! Always held in September, and it's very fun. They have an AMAZING Halloween event as well; the last time I attended was a few years back, but it had 3 main attractions and they were super scary and super fun!! In the winter they have the activities named above (might have new things now too!).",
   "Over all this place has some potential. The staff I engaged with was extremely nice. It was very once that they have everything you need there, including boots for a few extra dollars. \n\nOnly half the area had snow on it. I was told it's because it has been to warm and they needed it to be below 27 degrees to make snow. I found this odd because it has been below that temp for several days prior to visiting. They still charge full price even though only half of the place is available. \n\nIt seemed a little crowded because of the lack of snow, but lots of people. The slope was a little aggressive for young beginners and I seen a few people, including my son get hurt. If they had more snow and some beginner/learning slopes that would have been helpful. \n\nWould I go back? Sure, but not anytime soon, maybe if we are back in the area next year.",
   "The renaissance festival is a great experience,  with a lot to offer for kids and adults.  Food and drinks are delicious and only slightly pricey at $5 a drink and $9 for a Turkey leg. So much to see and do you can't fit it all into a single day!\nOrder of Wrath live steel fighting was the best event, in my opinion.  Where many of the other shows feel scripted, these warriors clash in a live, gladiator style arena that I felt was the most realistic and exciting show of the day! The joust was worth checking out as well, and interacting with the friendly characters throughout the festival really makes the experience unique."

   "My 11 year old daughter and myself just completed a 5K at Water Works Park, they done some upgrades and it looks amazing. I was so happy to see the amphitheater it looks awesome. The walking trail that we used for the 5K was free of any trash or debris, its a very nice nature walking area we had a great time!",
   "It's just a nice place to chill.\nUsually quiet.\nI saw the new fixture and thought I would take a look.",
   "One of the largest natural parks in the United States. Almost twice the size of central park in New York. Drive through it is relaxing.",
   "Nice trails seen a few deer. Good nice easy trails some a little more difficult but it's also February",

   "It was a fascinating tour of a historical home. The people who lived there and the fact that the home still exists are what's important here & of interest. The tour is very interesting and the guide I had was very knowledgeable. I'd recommend checking it out if you have time. Just try not to draw comparisons to Salisbury House or Terrace Hill.",
   "Great tour guides!  So informative.   Great for groups traveling from other countries, too!",
   "The house is unassuming from the outside but has a wealth of history inside. I took my younger son on a tour with me. He really likes history so he enjoyed it. I don't think it would be of interest to children that don't like history. There are two factors in play with this house. First, it was one of the first houses in the area. Second, it was discovered that the house was on the underground railroad. I would highly recommend this tour for people interested in one or both of those topics. The tour guide was very knowledgeable.",
   "Tour hostess was very interesting and really explained a lot of the small Victorian details.  Our 12 and 16 year olds enjoyed it too!",

Come spend a couple hours on Saturdays from 10am - noon and help the Polk County Conservation staff clean it up.",

The people employed there were required to live and work as if they existed during the era they were portraying. So you got a real picture of life then, and they could answer questions for us about the tasks they were performing . Not so anymore. What's more, the people visiting had a sense of the worth of the kind of museum experience they were witnessing. They appreciated it. Not so anymore. I saw alot of students there with 1 teacher for 30 kids. Not behaving. No respect for others. Teachers helping kids pee next to the trail instead of using the restrooms. Kids taking things that had been placed as examples of tools used in the era. Extremely disappointing. I wonder what happened? Is this just another example of how the latest grown generation has little use or appreciation for why we used to teach our children manners and respectfulness?"

Grocery store couple blocks away within walking distance for a long day in the park. Some tree shading areas around the ball fields which was a major plus especially for long days at the ball fields even days lol. Great place to hold adult softball tournaments,  but most of all youth travel ball tournaments great on site staff very friendly and helpful...No ATM onsite but take debit and credit cards for the snack bar reasonabley priced. Fields are pretty big,  takes a Big bat to Go Yard... Overall pretty good complex and we'll taken care of. Sorry and a skate park...",

We decided even before leaving the place that we will be coming back! Be prepared for a challenging hour (or less if you're lucky). Great way to build teamwork and work together to accomplish a rewarding end result.",

   "This place is fantastic, and they were very flexible with us when we ended up booking the same room as another group of strangers. We had a blast figuring out clues though we definitely needed some help along the way. The staff is really nice and friendly and fun, and the room we got was aesthetically awesome! The rules were straightforward though the clues varied in difficulty. In the end, we escaped The Phantom with only one minute to spare! I'm excited to go back and try future rooms.",
   "Harrison and Renea were amazing and helpful guides. There were 4 of us who did the Informant. The amazing guides made sure we were never stumped too long without revealing answers. This is my first time I've actually escaped a room and I felt incredibly accomplished! Well worth the money for a heart racing, cleverly designed escape room! I can't wait to go back!",
   "We were here on a Friday night to celebrate my boys' birthdays. You need to make reservations for the timeframe you'd like (you get an hour for $25/person). We were able to get an 8:30 slot on Friday night, the day before we were going. Tickets are non-refundable, so plan well. 5-7 slots are available per room.\n\nGabe chose the hardest room, The Phantom. It has a 35% escape rate. We all had to sign waivers and promise not to damage things in the room. Then off to two videos about 2 or three minutes a video. One for safety and the other to set up the premise of the room. We were guided to the room, told we had unlimited hints and away we went. This room was waaay harder than we thought. In the hour, we got about halfway through all the puzzles to be solved, and we had decided to divide and conquer. This was our first time ever in an Escape Room and hindsight says we might have wanted to start on a different room as it took us a bit to orient ourselves and figure out where we needed to go first. \n\nBut it was a blast!"

   "Chamberlain Park is a nice park just outside of downtown Des Moines.\n\nThere is a playground, a swing set, and a shelter.\n\nThe downsides are that there is not much parking besides on the street, and I didn't see a bathroom.\n\nBut probably the biggest upside is that there is plenty of shade, which is good for hot days.",
   "Hidden gem. Didn't know it was there, but a very nice well kept park",
   "There was trash there. Liquor bottles on the ground.",
   "Great little park WITH SHADE! Almost always has other kids to play with. Couple downsides though. There's a broken (fenced off,) slide that hasn't been fixed yet and sometimes there's loiterers. \nUPDATE: I haven't seen any loiterers near the playground for quite some time. (Hooray!) Lately there's been lots of happy use from this park. The parents and kiddos who visit are generally very nice and polite"

   "Ewing was relatively clean and has an interesting slope design to it, so your pup will wear out faster due to running uphill consistently. The back half of the yard is flatland, so easy for people to walk around on. The only takeaway from here is there's no bins to dispose of waste bags inside the fencing. Just one way out in the parking lot upon entry.",

When she brought us our drinks we placed our food order.  We got garlic cheese bread for out appetizer, salad with house dressing and stuffed chicken.  The food was ok but under seasoned.  Nothing was bad just not memorable.  At the end of our meal we got a free piece of chocolate cake and just like the rest of the meal it was okay.  We may come back to try Simons again but it won't be for a while if we do.",
   "The food here is incredible and the experience is even better!! The owner is one of the most genuine people you'll ever meet and they treat you like family. This is THE best food in town and considerably under priced. The flavor will exceed your expectations every time. I can't say enough great things about this place!",
   "I love this place! If you want great food and upscale  dining experience in a small neighborhood setting, this is your place. Simon the owner is always there and will greet you when you come in and will walk you to the door on the way out. This is nice personal service and his patrons are loyal fans. If there is a line for waiting he knows exactly when you came in so it's never a problem and no need to put your name on a list. \nThe food is incredible, its high dining experience at very reasonable cost. Its ideal for a date setting as it's very cozy and comfortable. The place has a rustic feel with a splash of modernism. Lighting is low and atmosphere is welcoming. So if you are looking for incredible food and a cozy atmosphere without the price tag please visit Simon's. Wait til you see what's for dessert \ud83d\ude09",
   "Amazing... Like always. Just go! Be patient if there's a wait, you'll be grateful you did!"

   "Excellent service! Amazing professionally cooked food! Definitely a great bargain and top level fine dining experience.",
   "Tried it out based on the reviews. Excellent place to go. High end restaurant, with great prices. High serving. Would recommend to anyone. Their pickles spears are homemade. Their tomato basil soup with tortellini was the best, I never had tomato soup that good before. I would recommend the soup.",
   "Family lunch. Great waitress Janelle or Chanelle. Wonderful onion rings and my Kill Bill Tenderloin was delicious! Pleasant chat with the manager and he was very much involved with the staff. He even cleaned the table next to us and was patient with our questions. One of my favorite places to dine.",
   "The fries are fresh potatoes sliced and fried topped with a few pinches of salt. It is DELICIOUS! The chicken is crispy and taste SO good. Lastly the sundae was AMAZING. vanilla ice cream with creamy crunchy chocolaty goodness with delicious nuts throughout it. The best part about it is that its topped with toasted marshmallow covering the goodness until you start eating it.",
   "Nice place for a date or other event. Has nice outdoor eating area. Perfect three months of the year. Everything on the menu is pretty good."

   "We made an early dinner reservation and had excellent service from the staff. The hostess was really helpful and our server Leviathan was very attentive and personable.\n\nAbsolutely order the hot brown and fried pickles, both were delicious. I got the waffle and fried chicken which was also really yummy. We were celebrating our 3 year anniversary and Bubba's comped our dessert (peanut butter icebox pie was phenomenal). Thank you for the dessert and helping us celebrate this special occasion and of course, for the great service and food! We'll be back :)",
   "Nice place to celebrate birthday! Shown are 2 piece chicken with sides of Cole slaw  and cream corn. Also shrimp and grits. Group also had chicken pot pie., Kentucky hot brown sandwich and chicken fried steak. All enjoyed!! Great drink selection too",
   "Even though we had a large party we still had great service. Very friendly staff. We tried 6 different appetizers and they were all excellent. Especially the mac and cheese bites. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was great. Not too greasy and nice seasoning. The waffle was huge and delicious with the honey butter. Had the whiskey pecan pie for dessert. It was phenomenal.",
   "Great first visit.  We don't get downtown too much these days but this place is worth a special trip. The service was perfect I didn't even really look at the menu too much I just asked her what she thought was good, and she nailed it.  From cocktails to apps everything we tried was excellent. The butter me up, \ud83e\udd43  leather and tobacco bourbon cocktails, so good. Spicy shrimp and grits, Smokey green beans, Fried Chicken, deviled eggs, some kinda fried crawfish thing, everything was great.  The only thing that bummed me out a little bit was missing the Raccoon River Brewing Company.",
   "Nice lunch. Went in with a group of about 10 for lunch. We had a reservation so I was surprised that they hadn't put tables together prior to our arrival. They remedied that quickly though. Service was really good for a table of our size. Food all came out at once and I got several drink refills. I had the Southern Protein Bowl because I wanted something on the healthier side. Most of the delicious looking southern fare they serve doesn't really fit the bill. Although the protein bowl didn't not seem like an together cohesive dish, I appreciated the effort to give me something besides plain salad with chicken breast (which they also have if you are less adventurous and not willing to break the calorie bank). I will return when I'm in the mood to do live it up. The bread basket looked delicious."

   "Great service, great food, as always! LOVE Fong's pizza and the servers are always friendly and happy to help. Was delighted to hear I could try a can of cider and if I didn't like it I could order a different drink without being charged! I loved they would do this! (I really liked the Wilson's Orchard Cherry Crush cider so didn't need to change it, but would not have tried it without the reassurance I could change my mind! Food was served quickly and warm. Love their thin crust and delicious toppings! Can't beat Fong's, and even bought a second pizza to take home with us!",
   "Any visitor to Des Moines must try Fong's pizza. The crowd favorite is the crab rangoon--and it won't let you down. But don't overlook other options. I enjoy the Thai pizza as well. You will find many nontraditional options on the menu. And check out the specials which rotate with the seasons--particularly around the holidays. Pizza innovation and a fun atmosphere!",
   "I have always enjoyed Fong's Pizza. They have unusual combinations but they are well balanced and hit the spot.\n\nThe crust reminds you of good homemade style crust. It's not the generic dough that every other pizza joint seems to use. It's got good texture and it's just the right amount.\n\nThe toppings are fresh and quality. You're not getting a flavoured grease pizza, you are getting a pizza worth sitting down and sharing.\n\nThey have pizza by the slice and pizza by the pie. I recommend them to everyone.",
   "Delicious pizza! I absolutely loved the crust. The waitress forgot to get my friend's drink, but other than that, the service was good. The price is good also. I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap our bill was. I'll definitely go back!",
   "The service was great! The pizza was delicious.. Drinks were great. Definitely going to go back for more some day soon."

   "My husband and I had a great experience at R\u014dCA! We had arrived early for our reservation and sat at the bar, the bartenders were very attentive and took their time explaining the drink menu or food menu, my husband had the Smoking Gun and I had the Maxwell\u2019s Silver hammer, we soon were seated and try several shared plates, we tried the spicy green beans, Fondue, crab croquettes, ratatouille, and seared scallops. The flavors were so good! The only disappointment was there were only 2 scallops. For dessert had a Fig Manhattan martini. The server was very attentive and the chef even came out and checked on tables. Overall a great experience.",
   "We had an awesome small plate experience here. Our family has a soft spot for fondue. It was great. We had the Thai shrimp and it was incredible. The reconstructed nachos are super tasty, but over priced. If they were larger it would be fine, but it's really only enough for one of you're not sharing and two if you are. The caipiranhas were excellent.",
   "Wonderful pre-theatre spot. RoCA remains one of our favorite restaurants in Des Moines. The shared plates are delicious, especially the Asian Lettuce Wrap. Another favorite is the flatbread. Service is spot-on--friendly and attentive. Share small plates, or order a meal. If you're lucky, the dessert will involve a bubbly crisp a la mode. RoCA provides a friendly, comfortable dining experience with personalized service. A true gem!",
   "Loved it the cocktails were delicious and the food spot on. You get what you pay for forsure",
   "Great low-key place for cocktails and wine. My wife and I have been there a few times and have had great service each time. The wait staff offered excellent drink suggestions and the food was outstanding. Great place for a date night if you are looking for a place to have intimate conversations."

Not only did he recommend his favorite app (calamari) but he made sure that we were taken care of. Everyone at the bar area deserves a raise. I even got a lesson on oysters. The young lady in the back answered all of our questions. I am so happy with our experience. Please come visit this restaurant.",
   "The service, the food, and the price were all great. Went with my sister, her husband, my niece, my nephew, my cousin, and my girlfriend. We all enjoyed the meal. When they brought out the appetizer, my girlfriend mentioned how she wished she picked a different side; the staff overheard and changed it for her. This spot is great for savory and sweet. I also liked the movie Django Unchained. Ha... if you\u2019re in Des Moines, go to Django!",

Also got the scalloped potatoes and Expresso cheesecake. We brought some bottles of wine for a $25 cork fee per bottle.  Decor in the restaurant was nice, they did have the cows and farm murals on the walls which I thought we cool but didn't really make sense in the setting.",
   "It was really good food. The Mac and cheese and for $1 more bacon. These were big chunks of bacon. My only complaint would be they are a little chalky from the flower but that's being but picky. The bone marrow appetizer was quite different and delicious. I liked it with the tomatoes as my wife liked it with the caper salad. The tomahawk steak was delicious. Cooked spot on. I would have preferred a little more salt and pepper seared on top. We were pretty shocked that the table next to us sent their steak back. The menu has what the temps mean. Underrated in all of this is the bread. The bread really was basically perfect. The service was amazing. The experience overall was a ton of fun. I wasn't a huge fan of the chocolate raspberry cake, but that's not the reason to go here. The cake itself was very good. I wasn't a fan of the raspberries (I love raspberries) and how the were in the middle.",
   "Wasn't very happy with the food. The service, ambiance and location are all amazing. The food? Who the heck is cooking this? It was mediocre at best. I've literally had better EVERYTHING, elsewhere. I was expecting one of the best meals I've ever had and it didn't even register in the top 10.\n\nOnce again, DSM suffers from lack of taste. I'm not sure who, in their right mind, is rating the food so highly here.",
   "Amazing food &. customer service. Michael was our waiter, and we couldn't have asked for better service. Great place to celebrate a special occasion.",

The service was on point the decor was nice two levels. I would definitely recommend this place",

The restaurant just has that cheaper restaurant feel now, instead of the upscale restaurant vibe it had before. And if you want to actually be able to eat & enjoy brunch food, don't go here, you'll spend the entire time waiting in line for the food.",

Grilled cheese bar, all the breakfast options, soups, tacos, deserts, bloody Mary bar and mimosas and many more. The quality of the food is good and better than most buffets for having so many options. I will be back and try to bring many people with me.",

   "Two thumbs up to Buzzers Billy's! A couple of weeks ago we celebrated our 16th anniversary and it has been a tradition to have dinner & drinks here every year (other then flood years) because we got married in Alabama and Buzzard Billy's makes it feel like we are in the south again. Of course this year we could not go out to eat so they brought the south to us! Had great food but was lacking our favorite Hurricane drinks. Not allowed to have alcohol delivered via 3rd party service but when the manager Jeff heard about our anniversary tradition he delivered our favorite beverage himself! I was so happy I forgot to give him the tip I had in my hand for him! A big thanks to Jeff and Buzzard Billy's for making our anniversary dinner fabulously memorable once again! Can't wait to come in for more great food and drinks in the future! Thank you Jeff!",

   "If you love German beers, you'll love the only German beer house in Des Moines, the Hessen Haus.  For some reason people really enjoying drinking their beer from the glass boot, but clearly the 1L giant mug is a better deal.  Food is the typical German fare with a few choices of sausages.  We're not a huge fan of the giant pretzels either, but it's definitely soft and soaks up plenty of beer.  Actually, we usually don't care that much about the food by the second liter of beer.  Parking has been slightly problematic recently due to the closing of the lot next to the restaurant, but with some patience, a street spot does open up eventually.  The service is really good, especially for large parties.",
   "Food was DELICIOUS!!!  When we first got there it was a few minutes before anyone even paid any attention to us. We had to sit at a dirty table and wait another few minutes before it was cleaned off.  After this.... it was definitely worth the wait. I will be going back!  (Hope service is better next time around)",
   "Great German restaurant. German cuisine is honestly not my favorite but the menu had something even for me and it was delicious! I had a very nice waitress and enjoyed the outdoor seating on a nice evening.",
   "Amazing! We lived in Germany for 7 years and this was the first German food we have had in the US that actually tasted German. We had a Jager schnitzel and salad and a giant beer. So yum! The spatzle was amazing too!  The atmosphere made us feel like we were back in Germany. We loved it!",
   "I celebrated my PhD today in this great restaurant. happy to tell that we passed a pleasant evening and the restaurant was unquestionably one of the reasons for that strong evening. The stuff  cooperated in a very nice style, the cuisine was very good and my guests were so  glad. We shall definitely visit again for more joyful events. Thank you very much."

   "Awesome restaurant and wedding venue. Amazing food in both parts. Whatever they are doing in the kitchen - they do it so right! Haven\u2019t had anything from here I didn\u2019t love, and all of the staff I\u2019ve met have been great. Absolutely recommend the taproom whether you are looking for a place to get married or just a place to grab a bite and a beer.",
   "Awesome selection of Iowa beers. Very cool place whether you are from here or elsewhere (like me). I want to take this idea back to my state. Love to support local beers. One of the best selections of all kinds of beer I\u2019ve run across.   Pretty lively for a week night as well. If I\u2019m ever back in Des Moines, I\u2019m headed here.",
   "Went here for dinner with another couple. Although they were very busy and we had a bit of a wait, we had no problem being quickly served at the bar (which was completely packed) while we waited for our table. Food was amazing. Service was great especially for how busy they were. Menu was pretty simple. Mostly burgers and salads. Entree's were to be expected of a bar and grill.",
   "The Iowa Taproom was a nice end to my VERY long day yesterday. The hubby and I split a self created flight and we all ordered something different so everyone could try everything. There wasn't one thing that we didn't like. The quality of the food, the taste and the value for the money was excellent. Our service was excellent and we all enjoyed the warm and calm atmosphere. It was a very enjoyable experience and I, personally, can't wait to go back again.",
   "We had a great time here! Beers were great, as was the service. The craft root beer they have on tap is delightful as well. We had a variety of appetizers and meals, all of which were very tasty and satisfying. We would definitely return!"

I'm not a big eater and don't care for hugh portions, but seriously, it was three spoonfuls if this, a single bite of that, and a few squirts of goo to decorate the plate. My husband walked across the street after a five course meal and got a sandwich at Jimmy John's.",

Ended up being the last table seated, with 5 people and felt forgotten when we were ready for the check.\nI will be back, but moreso for a date night rather than a family outing.

We had the salmon club and Turkey sandwich- both were incredible- fresh ingredients, rich flavors, and very filling. We might even grab food for the road tomorrow because it was so good. I would highly recommend!",

The portions are perfect and the presentation is artistic. The atmosphere is beautiful, however, the clientele is young and fashionable and the temperature is a bit chilly. The food is so spectacular that I will return to try each item on the menu! Enjoy!",
   "First time here and I am very impressed! Food was amazing, service was amazing and coffee was great. My only complaint would be that I wish they had syrup for their coffee as I would have loved to get a vanilla latte! 10/10 will be back.",
   "This is the best place in town for a quick upscale breakfast with fresh ingredients and perfectly done eggs. I alternate between my favorites of Avocado Toast with poached eggs or the Everything Bagel Toast with poached eggs-so much flavor. Ambiance is upscale but not stuffy. Prices are over $10 for breakfast, but it is necessary for high quality ingredients and perfectly prepared food. Worth every dime!",
   "St. Kilda has some great eclectic dishes. We went for breakfast I had the breakfast tacos which were delicious. My husband had the \"cubano\" sandwich... we are from South Florida and he said that sandwich could compete with the Cuban sandwiches back home.

   "Unique Midwest take on Mexican flavors. The flavors are all there but the remix of proportions makes the food special.\n\nVery friendly staff and nice ambience.",
   "I enjoyed the venue; very clean, cordial staff, and nice patio area where we sat. I would definitely make this a spot for taking my wife on a date night. However, I didn't agree with the prices. For 3 tacos, a sandwich, 3 salsa dips, and one drink it was just shy of $50. I understand trying to set yourself apart and make it upscale with a unique style/flavor/take but when it boils down to it other places are much cheaper for roughly the same quality in taste."

Inventive, Real, wholesome and minimally processed food is at the heart of their weekly menu. I've tried many items from freezer and frozen cases. Chia pudding, stuffed pepper soup, chicken pot pie, tuna salad crunch, chickpea hummus, are just a few of my faves. The quality is superb and I love that they arent afraid to season the foods with spices and herbs. This is a Far better option to have healthy meals from a LOCAL small business than ordering the food boxes online. Highly recommend!",
   "I visited The Grateful Chef to grab something quick and healthy for lunch recently and was surprised by how unique and wonderful this place is. It seems like more of a location to grab larger, pre-made lunch and dinner meals - there is a giant selection of really creative, delicious sounding meals that need to be taken home and baked off. As for me and my needs, I was wanting something immediate and had a hard time between choosing the grab-n-go options... so I got the two that I wanted most: A fresh veggie and hummus sandwich and a smashed chickpea salad. The sandwich was very fresh, had unique flavors and texture, and was both light and balanced, and the smashed chickpea salad was also exciting with the flavor combinations and texture (red onion, dill pickles, turmeric, mustard). I don't have any allergies and haven't adopted any sort of diet (gluten-free, vegan, etc.), but these options both fell under those categories and I completely loved them both.\nI am new to Des Moines, and even more new to what the south side has to offer, so this was such a wonderful surprise. I will definitely be back and plan on telling more people about this place - especially friends and family that are looking for exciting vegan &/or gluten free options.",
   "The grateful chef was an amazing place so many organic made to order pre-made meals it was just absolutely a fantastic place to bedefinitely a top choice for any vegans out there that want a good quality meal for a very good price and the juice cleanse juices they have outstanding"

   "We showed up at around 11 a.m. on a Saturday when Farmer's Market was winding down. We wanted to get a bite to eat and something to drink. We got seated right away, and there was only a handful of other people sitting at the bar area and a couple of tables with customers sitting in their outdoor area. So they definitely weren't busy. Then it took about 15 minutes before the server arrived to take our order. 15 minutes later, glasses of water arrived for everyone. 10 minutes later beer arrived for everyone. So this is primarily a bar and from the time we walked in the door and were seated, it took 40 minutes for beer to arrive to our table at a time when they were definitely not busy. The food items to choose from at that time consisted of their breakfast menu. The Guinness potatoes and onions were quite undercooked. So the beer was just fine, but the food was not so great, and the service was pretty slow.  I really liked a lot of the decorations, and it did have a design aesthetic which is reminiscent of an English pub. But unfortunately the food and service were just not up to par.",

But tonight I decided since A DONG is the cleanest restaurant I have ever been to on a regular day, I would order from them. I walked in wearing a mask, they had baby wipes, disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer on the counter for customer use. The polite wonderful lady that rang up my order, wiped my debit card before handing it back to me. She gave me a complimentary ginger tea and an extra order of springs rolls on the house. They were clean, courteous and the food was delicious. Not only are they the best restaurant in town, but they are the ONLY restaurant for a pandemic. I was so impressed.",

   "Consistently great! My sister recommended this place to me when I first moved to Iowa about 10 years ago. It has been one of my favorite places. Remember that this is Vietnamese food, not Chinese food. Some people go there expecting it to be something else. It is a very clean restaurant with super friendly staff. There is never a long wait for your food. Everything is done in a very timely manner. Same menu for lunch and dinner, with a lot of different options. Everything is fresh and comes in good size portions. Not expensive either.!"

They make sure they greet you and let you know they will be right with you even when extremely busy,  they get to you asap and you don't wait long to be seated and have drinks and order taken was only 3-5 mins and that was with a full house they literally only had 4-5 small tables remaining when we arrived and we arrived at the same time as another couple and they we're seated at the same time as us and order taken right after ours!  We always have a great experience,  and their plates are well worth the money!  The kids plates also come with a large amount of food!  You will not be disappointed by coming here!  I highly recommend it!!!",
   "Love the place! Try to get here once a month! I have never had a bad experience here. The food is great and the service is always exceptional. Everything from the salsa to the dessert is awesome!!"

   "Easily the best pretzel bites you'll find anywhere.  The cheese sauce is very obviously house made and I would consider trading state secrets for the recipe. (The server informs me that it's the same cheese sauce they use for their mac & cheese.)\n\nThe chicken pesto bowl has a rather more subtle and smokier pesto, which works to the benefit of the dish. Many pesto recipes over-salt the sauce, which would overshadow the mushroom and fresh tomato flavors. Definitely a solid choice for the salt-conscious as well as those looking for a meal not dominated by one flavor."

Servers are VERY friendly and the service is fast as well! FULLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!",

It's very much a special occasion place and you'll enjoy every minute of a the candle lit, nice old house vibe.\n\nWe started with the polenta cakes which were simple but incredible. They were a perfect, light starter. Then I followed up with gnocchi (literally the best in Des Moines) and my boyfriend got the New York Strip. Both were delicious and came with great sauces and were perfectly portioned. We left stuffed, choosing to drink our dessert downtown.\n\nMy recommendation is to make a reservation. It's a small place that can fill up quick. Also pick a meal and wine pairing the wait staff recommends because there are lots of things you can't get anywhere else. They know what's best so you better trust them \ud83d\ude09.",

   "Amazing dinner experience at The Angry Goldfish. We had an awesome waitress who was also working as a bartender! We didn\u2019t catch her name, but she was wearing a maroon Exile t-shirt! Our drinks, apps and food came out so quickly and everything was hot and AMAZING! We ordered the Sriracha goldfish and the pretzels and beer cheese for appetizers. (Beer cheese and pretzels were OUTSTANDING!) Then, we ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese and a side of mac and cheese and the meatloaf meal. Both were amazing and we would eat again! Then, I paid and accidentally left my card. The waitress came running out to our car to give it back to us!",
   "This place has a clean and cozy atmosphere! The food.... the food is PHENOMENAL. All homemade food. Small menu, which for me is perfect, with tasty choices! Their AG burger is definitely a go-to. It has a zesty sauce on it that's to die for!\nTheir signature spicy goldfish crackers are really good and honestly, I grab some to go, too! \nThis place is perfect for our date nights!",
   "Small neighborhood atmosphere with home cooked food and a relaxing environment. Whether your in work clothes or dressed up you should feel comfortable. Wait staff is amazing. Worth checking out!",
   "The place is pretty chill and the interior looks cool. Especially like the bathroom sign, it gave me a good laugh. Had a small poutine with my wife which tasted very good, nice strips of steak and delightfully savory. My wife had a Goldfish Mule which according to her was on point and one of the best that she ever had. We both tried the fish and chips which I very much liked. My wife was excited that they made not only all of their entrees fresh but the sauces were homemade too. Great atmosphere and the staff was friendly, be happy to come back again.",
   "What an amazing place! We stopped in on a Saturday around 12:30 to a crowded house. The only seats available for two of us were at the bar. We were greeted with friendly faces and INCREDIBLE customer service. Monty was our server, but the other bartenders chipped in for drink refills, etc. \nWe started out with fried pickles, then I ordered the warm bacon salad (minus the feta) and my son ordered the Sriracha tenderloin and fries. We split the fries with a side of brown gravy. Everything was absolutely superb. It was fresh and hot out of the kitchen, and even after finishing our meals, the remaining fries were cooler, but still delicious. The dipping sauce for the pickles was spicy and I assume has Sriracha, as was the tenderloin, obviously, but not so hot that it was overwhelming. There were just great mixes of flavors.\nThis was my first visit, but I will be back. It was so FANTASTIC!!"

There staff always seems to be slightly behind the ball too which for what you are paying you would expect more. For example, we had to wait like 10 minutes to get small plates as they were all out of them and waiting for them to come out of the washer... There Saki bombs are less than desirable on presentation too.",

I went for brunch, and it was a bit of a slow say given the ongoing viral epidemic, but the food was excellent, the decor was tasteful, and the staff was attentive and kind. I hear this place also has a supreme happy hour, but I wouldn't know anything about it. I do recommend!",
   "Worst dining experience. I always heard great things about Eatery A and was excited to try them out, especially after seeing they had a gluten free crust and dairy free cheese for their famous pizzas. While ordering I\u2019m informed they are out of vegan cheese, not a big deal, but then find out their gluten free crust has dairy. So the waitress says you can either get the normal gluten crust without dairy or the gluten free with dairy. Neither of which I can have. Unfortunately, the rest of their menu is very limited for allergy sensitive people. I ended up a steak which was very undercooked and dangerous for me, which I didn\u2019t realize at first since it was so dark in there. I was only able to barely eat half of my meal. Additionally, we brought out of town guests and after they ordered the waitress came back to inform us they were almost out of what one of them ordered so they could only do a half order (apparently they were out of everything that night). At the end of the meal the waitress tried to make our guests feel better by saying she only charged us for a half of the order instead of the full. Really? So they charged us for what they served us? Not sure how that makes it better. Lastly, the bar tender chugging beer and dropping f-bombs just added the cherry on top. If you have food sensitivities or allergies don\u2019t go here. A very expensive bill for a very disappointing meal."

Follow the directions of the server and order a starter or two followed by one to two dishes per person and you'll leave feeling satisfied.\n\nEverything is very vegetable forward but that's what I enjoyed the most. Elevating vegetables in the bleak landscape that is not only American, but Midwestern dining is a feat. \n\nWe'll definitely be back at some point.",
   "Our first time visiting Harbinger and we enjoyed it. Smaller, intimate space. Focus on quality- NOT quantity so be prepared for that. Staff 5 stars! Everyone kind, welcoming, helpful, etc. Really felt like they wanted us there. We didn't have reservations so just sat at the bar. Fun watching all the drinks being prepared. I had the butternut squash which was an absolute delight. BF had peking duck which was good- we both liked mine better. $60 for 3 drinks and 2 meals. The taste and quality were so wonderful- portion sizes quite small.  Anyway- fun last minute decision and good time. Glad we tried it!",
   "Harbinger is an interesting place. I would definitely go once in a while for an experiential meal. My favorite aspect of the experience was the presentation of each dish and for a few of them I thought the flavours were really well orchestrated. The ambiance was not on par with the sophistication of the food. I would eat here again to see how things have progressed.",

Easily the best food I've had in the area, and I appreciate the focus on vegetables/vegetarian dishes plus their efforts to highlight things you won't find at most other restaurants. Great service, and it's fairly reasonably priced if you take advantage of the happy hour deals!",

   "Wanting a change of pace from pork dishes (no offense, Iowa!), my husband and I came here to check out the seafood options to plan a nice dinner at home. The variety of options were amazing and the prices were very reasonable on nearly everything that caught our eye. I had intentions on picking up some scallops because I have a weak spot in my heart (and belly) for that, but after looking around more, we ended up choosing some large swordfish fillets. When we made dinner later, we didn't have to do anything elaborate to the swordfish in preparation - the flavor and texture was hearty and wonderful. I have heard fantastic things from numerous people who have eaten here, and will absolutely be back in the future to dine - but the market portion itself is worth checking out!",
   "I'm no seafood connoisseur but I love their tartar sauce! Great service too, Jenny? even offered to get our drinks to go, which is a nice touch.",
   "pros: service was good and the lobster was pretty good. Location in Ankeny was easy to get to. \nCons: for being a seafood place I expected decent sea food. When shrimp is over cooked and the scallops are just okay, it\u2019s pretty disappointing since that should be something your really good at when your a seafood place. With the high rating I expected more. The atmosphere was okay but I thought it would be a little nicer given the price of food. I will likely not go back unless I try the other location as I have heard that one is much different/ better.",
   "A pretty darn good place to eat. Fresh seafood daily and fixed and presented beautifully.  I had Wild Gulf Shrimp, grilled. Delicious. Salmon looked beautiful..great pasta dishes too. You won't be sorry. Go early or you might have a wait.",
   "Awesome food & the staff was great\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f"

   "This little gem is tucked away in the corner of the market. Best pho I've had in the city. Get the crab rangoon as it's got the real thing in it. The seafood pho is the show stopper! Delicious and authentic",
   "Very busy place and for good reasons. Food is phenomenal. prices are great. I always leave with left overs",
   "Good portion of large Pho that won't break the bank.\n\nFlavors of the Pho leans toward the sweeter side with sprinkle hints of star anise and cinnamon. The soup is clean and has an alright depth.\n\nAfter finishing, it gets your mouth to the \"I need some water\" state.\n\nNice service and busy sometimes for seating.\n\nFor being tucked away in a Super Market, it is not a bad Pho.",
   "This is one of the only places I go for Pho, and I've been to many across the Des Moines metro. It is by far the best. The service is always fast and friendly and it's always a reasonable price. Plus, I love that it is inside of an Asian grocery. Always fun to walk around and shop on a full stomach. :)",
   "AWESOME PHO!!!! Best in Des Moines for sure! They have great Boba too and a selection of other awesome vietnamese dishes. It is in the front corner of the Asian grocery store."

   "Just got the simple gyro. Easily the most delicious gyro I've had in the area. The meat was tender and seasoned well, the tomato was extremely fresh, and the pita was extremely soft. The fries, on the other hand, were a little bland so I would recommend trying the Greek fries instead. Food came out very quickly and the staff was absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend visiting Olympic Flame!",

This is easily one of my favorite restaurants.",

After that, a dessert tray!\n\nAll good stuff...",

From pasta to chicken wings (one of the few places that still sell the ENTIRE wing) to pizza to lobster to great desserts, Noah\u2019s is still the one. We do mainly carry out, but try having a seat at the sunken bar. Great drinks & extensive wine list. Friendly service from managers, host & servers.",
   "I was referred to Noah's Ark by the concierge at my hotel downtown in Des Moines. I'm so glad I went there! I arrived at opening during lunch. The menu is so big, so much to choose from! I ended up getting the Chicken Parmesan lunch special, I think it was 12.95. A great deal. First they brought out one of their famous garlicky love knots. Then I had a house salad with their famous creamy Italian dressing. It was a generous serving of salad, and it was good. The dressing was to die for! I don't usually like creamy Italian, but the waitress told me how good it was. She was right! It was amazing! I'll have to buy some next time I'm there. The Chicken Parmesan was delicious. It came with spaghetti and a very big Dinner Roll! That roll was like two rolls. The chicken parmesan had a little bit of bell pepper and onion in it, which I loved! After my meal I was too full for dessert. But the waitress gave me a complimentary bite of some delicious cheesecake! That was very nice of them to do that. A good way to get me to buy a big piece next time I'm there!",
   "I admire this place! They offer tasty dishes, they have a nice menu, The chef in that restaurant is a specialist, I love a lot trying all their food. The food is always fresh and tasty, the attitude towards the customers  is very good too. I often go to  this place and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it with no hesitation.",
   "Based on the reviews I expected delicious food and good service. However, the best part was our server.  It was surprising that their vegetable side dishes were seemingly from a can and very overcooked.  The fruit salad - also from a can.  Their baked potato must be very popular as they had run out of them by 5pm.  The Spaghetti side was overcooked, very mushy and not drained that left a pool of water on the plate and which diluted the delicious sauce.  The Prime Rib was very undercooked for Medium Rare and was sinuous.  There was an old and limp piece of lettuce on the plate as decoration that is unnecessary and a waste.  One of the highlights was the Garlic Knot rolls provided prior to the meal.",
   "I go to this excellent restaurant often  as I enjoy the good mood that is part of this place. The crew is highly loyal and skilfull. The service is certainly fast. Needless to say, the food they cook is magnificent. I have been there more than once and I was always delighted. The pay is decent. I recommend this place to to all."

The bread that you start off with is fantastic. Soup or salad options are great. The server was always prompt with delivering our orders and the wine options were very reasonable. The pastas were so good! Can't go wrong with any of them. The dessert tray that they bring at the end looks so good I wish I could order every cake they have! The carrot cake was amazing though. And when we got our check at the end we were shocked at how affordable everything was. You'll love this place!",

There was a party of 10+ seated beside us that were celebrating a birthday and insanely loud, and while there were other dining rooms, this was the one my parry of 2 was seated in. I wish they had started using other rooms to accommodate because I couldn't hear myself think for the entire meal. Certainly not our server's fault though.",

   "The bar area is nice and the soup and bread was good, but they seated us in a drab area upstairs. Dipping oil wasn\u2019t offered but is available upon request (I spotted another table with some) Eggplant was greasy and not good. Service was great. Prices are way to high for this quality. They did remove the charge for my meal which was very nice of them."

In addition to that, the price is affordable. I sent my friends to this spot with great pleasure.",
   "The last time I visited Maxie's they were still at the original location on Ingersoll. That must have been the early 1970s. Decided to try them out tonight. now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. We pretty much had the place to ourselves probably because of the weather.\nOrdered the combination breaded veggies ; onion rings, breaded mushrooms, fried pickles & fried green beans. All were hot, crisp and perfectly seasoned.\nDinner was a Rarebit burger and the white cheddar bacon jam Burger. Both burgers were prepared exactly as ordered. all of that plus a couple of glasses of half priced house wine and expert service made for a surprisingly awesome evening. Maxie's will definitely be a place we will visit often from now on.",

Comfort food from days gone by still being served up and the service was spot on.\n My wife mentioned we had never been here before but always wanted to stop.

Hearing welcome to the family from the two of them really made our day.\n Thanks for great food and an amazing staff of employees .We will be back often. \n\nMike and Julie Davis",
   "It's a fair price for the food. Which is good but it's like dinner kinda food so it's what it is. But the staff is excellent and always happy and helpful.",
   "I can't remember the last time I rated a restaurant so low.... no greeting when we came in, 3 employees went past us and no one greeted or offered to seat us. Finally someone sat us after more people came in behind us.  The waitress was fine at first, got our drinks and appetizer, but then she got a table of 8. She took their drink orders and got all of their drinks, then got their appetizer orders and served those, then went to get their dinner order. Never once between all of that did she check on us, bring out our meals, refill our empty drinks that were on the edge of the table.\n\nSomeone else brought our food out around the time she was starting their appetizer orders and the fries and onion rings were cold so it had obviously been sitting in the back for awhile.  I also didn't get the salad with house dressing that I'd asked for.  \n\nWhen I saw her taking the dinner orders at the other table, I sighed and said something to my son and then someone else that was walking by  finally over - I think he heard me.  I asked him for refills on our cups and told him the sides were cold and that I just wasn't hungry anymore.  I did NOT ask for a discount, I just wanted something to drink and to leave.\n\nNeither of us finished our meals and for the first time that I can remember we left the food and didnt even bring it home for left overs or to feed to our chickens.... \n\nThe appetizer was good, my ton said he liked the baked potato.  Cold fries and onion rings on my plate - well those are never good cold.  My meal was, egh.  \n\nThe guy that refilled our water asked if we wanted the check, I said yes and I have no idea why he asked if I wanted two checks when I was having dinner with my 13 year old son.  That was odd.  He made a point of telling me that he took the appetizer off the bill (since my dinner was cold??)  I said that wasn't necessary, paid and left.\n\nI wouldn't go back.  I saw other great reviews but to have a waitress completely ignore us for that long, cold food, leaving a salad off... Simply not worth my money."

Not to mention the sushi is well crafted, fresh, and always hits the spot. 10/10 would recommend. \ud83d\ude07",
   "My wife and I went on a dinner date to miyabi 9 and had a wonderful time. we were well taken care of in all aspects of our service with some complimentary service being that it was our first time and we were blown away at the quality and craftsmanship that they put into their sushi as well as their desserts. The restaurant itself is quaint and very cozy and clean. we ate at the bar which we don't typically do but really enjoyed it watching and communicating with the chefs.  We will most certainly be heading back there in the near future because we left so satisfied. We would highly recommend Miyabi 9 for sushi over the many other options in the metro area.",
   "I was leaving my friend\u2019s birthday sleepover and realized I had locked my keys in my Jeep. While waiting for roadside assistance, I ventured down the street to find something to eat. Alas, I find myself in front of Miyabi 9. I sat at the bar, having the ability to watch the sushi being prepared. The owner was working, busily creating wonderful works of art as I watched in absolute awe. He personally took my order of smoked salmon and yellowtail tuna. Absolutely melt in my mouth, fresh seafood. It was utopian bliss for my palate. I also ordered a serving of the mini spring rolls, apparently looking so incredibly appetizing, the woman sitting next to me placed an order of her own! I will definitely return!\u2014I believe locking my keys in the car was fate. \ud83c\udf63 I\u2019d give Miyabi 9 five THOUSAND stars if I could!"

   "My family and I decided to try something new and chose Chucks! We came in last Saturday, while the restaurant was quite busy we were offered the choice of the music room - the room was fairly busy but we were seated immediately. Our server Kelsey greeted us right away with waters and assured us wait times may take a little longer. We weren\u2019t sure what to order, she recommended several of her favorites, we chose mozzarella sticks and wings to get started. They were  DELICIOUS. Great portions. Kelsey continued following up with us, refilling our drinks & making sure we were happy, she had a great attitude, kept smiling (which is a big deal to have a continuous smile and bubbly personality to me). She was very busy, having several other tables and rooms. We ended the night with a chicken fettuccine, a spinach ravioli, and a large buffalo chicken pizza. All was worth the wait! Very great tasting food, good pricing and great people!! Will be back soon!",
   "I've always driven past this place but never thought I'd ever go in. My boyfriend and I decided to try something new, and since this was right down the street from us, we ended up choosing this place. Best. Food. Ever! I ordered the Bruschetta Burger and was so impressed. My boyfriend ordered wings and spinach ravioli in alfredo sauce. Alfredo sauce is always a hit or miss with me but when I tried some of it from his plate... amazing! These people are so friendly and definitely know how to make food.",
   "We met friends for pizza at Chuck's recently and thoroughly enjoyed it! Great pizza and onion rings, tremendous service and perfectly mixed cocktails. The place isn't fancy, but is reminiscent of a classic 1960s neighborhood restaurant. We had the \"Everything\" pizza and it was superb! Last Friday my friend and I made a late evening trip to Chucks for pizza. It was delicious! We had some onion rings as an appetizer. They were thin and crispy and so tasty! Our waiter was right on top of things. I highly recommend this restaurant!!",
   "Great food and service. Very good portion size. I\u2019ll Definitly return.",
   "This spot is worth giving a shot. They have large portions for reasonable rates. Constantly clean and with excellent vibes. Will visit here again."

   "Ginnchiest place in Iowa!! How can you NOT love this place?? Great Beer and Food. Super cool place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon... I will visit again!!",
   "Food was absolutely delicious!  Perfectly prepared!  My tenderloin was crisp, but tender, not overbreaded or overcooked!  Fries were perfect, not burnt. Loved my meal, and Bloody Mary drink was outstanding, beautiful to see and refreshing to drink. Also, great place for a conversation.",
   "I don't know how they managed to make this relatively new bar feel so perfectly divey. The food, the music, everything was on point. Great comfy bar to hang out and drink in for a while. The chicken was salty, crispy and delicious.",
   "What a great dive with good service and good food. Worth a visit. Try the fried cheese curds and the Lil Smokies.",
   "The bacon-wrapped tator tots are the best! Atmosphere is old school... Takes me back to my childhood. Only drawback is it's always busy... That and it would be nice if you could get the beers from next door El Bait Shop!"

   "Really warm and comfy atmosphere. The dine in can\u2019t fit up to 45 people. Plenty of space but when it\u2019s the rush hour, you might have to come in early as there will be a line. Trust me, the food is worth the wait :) \n\nThe food being serve here are delicious (specially for the affordable price), you have to try out their Waveland\u2019s beat skillet! It\u2019s delicious and well season! It\u2019s a decent size for one person serving but not to worry cause you can always order anything you want in the menu half the size. My favorite food here is their hash brown, it\u2019s golden brown crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, super delicious ! \n\nThere limit parking on the front of the dine in but you can park on the street. It\u2019s usually a very short walk to the restaurant. \n\nIt\u2019s a family friendly restaurant and the waitresses here are super friendly and sweet. If you have any questions at all they will have the answer waiting for you. They serve they food hot and fast! If you\u2019re hungry, there won\u2019t be a long wait right after placing your order. \n\nHope you enjoy this dining restaurant!",
   "It was a great visit.  I'm visiting from New Orleans and love a good diner/cafe breakfast.  My cousin suggested Waveland Cafe.  It's in a quiet residential area and seems to be a popular spot.  I had pancakes n hashbrowns. Molly was a great server and took her time to make sure my order was to my liking. The food was delicious and the place was nice",
   "Great food! This was my 1st time visiting and it was extremely busy but in a good positive way...the employees were doing the best they could to manage. I would visit and suggest this place again",
   "Waveland Cafe is riding the crest of public approval these days and for good reasons! Good food, friendly service, hometown character and history.  My only complaint about the \"skillet\" meal was that it looked and tasted like an omelet over hash browns. Where's the skillet? Parking is a hassle even if you get a space out front - then it's hard to get out. Even so it was a full cafe at 10 am on Tuesday.",
   "Always great good and great service. I'm from a rural community and the Waveland is just like home. Cozy, comfortable, and hoppin'!"

   "Great place to pick up something quick and there are healthy options. My favorite dishes are the veggie scramble, Cajun tuna sandwich, salmon Cesar salad and the gyro pizza. I honestly haven't had anything I've disliked. The desserts are divine too - try the macaroons!!!",
   "service wasn't great. food was decent but got the complete wrong drink initially. 2 of the 4 macarons were broken",
   "Had the lemon shrimp grain bowl and the shrimp was amazing! There wasn't quite the lemon flavor I expected. Also, maybe a total of a quarter cup of grains in the bowl. Small flaws in an otherwise great meal.",
   "been going here since they opened. I love their Turkey club. Then last week go in for one and was told that all they had left was what was on top of the coolers for sandwiches. Mind you the sandwiches are just on metal platter ON TOP of the coolers. My daughter has went by at 8 AM and they are out there. So I want a fresh one. She wouldn't make one. After a few weeks ago when my supervisor had a sandwich with a bite out of it and had to go back and tell them about it... don't think they should be turning away business. I won't be back. too many places downtown to go to eat that will make fresh items from their menu. Maybe  they should say we won't fix things fresh off the menu any longer???!  just serve the warm sandwiches on the coolers... ick!",

   "We absolutely love this place. In fact, they closed just before the holidays and we were lost. The food is always fresh and warm. So good. The best pho in the area.",
   "Fawn's Asian Cuisine is a small stand-alone restaurant. We got there right when they opened on Saturday morning at 11 am. We didn't have a reservation, but they were quickly able to seat six of us easily.\n\nI started with their crab rangoons. They were really large, freshly made and had a very crisp shell. For my entree, I ordered the combination Lo Mein. The flavor of the sauce was fresh & gingery!\u00a0 The noodle dish contained large pieces of beef, chicken, and generously-sized prawns. It was a huge portion, and I was able to take half of it home.\n\nGreat prices, and great food!",
   "This place always pleases me. Nice choices of curries, pho or traditional Chinese . Lunches include soup, egg roll and entree. I had a tasty beef and snow peas and my buddy had chicken red curry- both were excellent.",
   "Amazing Pho! This was my first time here and I lived it. Service was super fast and extremely friendly. I had P6(chicken). The broth was very flavorful and the chicken was grilled to perfection. Will definitely be back!",
   "From the first moment  you come to this restaurant  they give you a nice feeling. Very courteous hosts, it is a kind restaurant to  pass time with friends or with your date. Great  food, qualified  chief cook and stuff, decent  pay and nice  service. Warmly recommended."

   "Our favorite neighborhood restaurant. The fajitas are awesome, and the husband has several favorites too. Chips and salsa while you wait is the perfect appetizer. \u2764",
   "Hands down my favorite restaurant. The food is always GREAT and the staff is so friendly. Even through this pandemic and having to take the orders to go, it is just as good!",
   "We arrived on a whim. Driving around at 7 PM on a Friday night looking for a decent place to eat. We drive by Tequila and decided to give it a try. It was a cozy, family-owned place with booths and tables. I ordered a Strawberry Daiquiri and he a Diet Pepsi. The salsa was nice and fresh and the queso runny, but very good. The entree came quickly. You order by number here, although it is a sit down restaurant with menus. I got #42 Shredded Beef Burrito and he the (forgot #) Tequila Burrito. Both we very good and pretty much the stand faire Mexican. However, he also ordered the Mexico City Taco which was to die for. And he said he'd order a plate full next time instead of just the one. Giving 4 stars because everything was adequate +, but a little lacking on friendliness. We intend to come back, although wouldn't make it a priority.",
   "The ladies up front are so friendly and helpful and the food is fantastic. Everything is fresh and affordable, the margaritas are strong, and the interior is warm and comfortable. Definitely the best food and service on the East side.",
   "Best Mexican food around. I grew up in so cal and this is the closest to that style of food I have found. This is my new #1 favorite Mexican food restaurant . The inside is nothing fancy but the food is good and the service is great."

The bar is stocked but I would suggest the malts and or shakes. You can get a beer anywhere. A nicely made malt with the extra metal cup can make any day great.",
   "Excellent 50's-style restaurant with a traditional American menu from burgers, soups and sides.\n\nBoth booth and bar-style seating is available.  The service is fast and friendly.  Very popular among locals and a great place to experience if you are just visiting.\n\nThe diner can be found near Drake University.",
   "Plan some extra time it's not fast. Our server wasn't paying attention and kept saying our order wrong. At the end he brought what he wanted not what we ordered. Told him three times we didn't get a shake. Never got it but was charged. They corrected it at the register. The food that we got was really good. It's worth a try. I hope you have a better experience then we did. Keep in mind the food was good.",
   "Great landmark with perfect diner menu. Happy staff. Upbeat atmosphere and excellent blue plate specials. KILLER MILK SHAKES. particularly exceptional sweet potato fries.",
   "Really has a nostalgic feel! Staff is friendly, prices are fair, and serving size is generous. And - they have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for hard to please children! Highly recommended."

   "Most times food is not bad and when you like their food everything is wonderful but when something is done wrong they instantly blame the customer. I have ate there many times over the past year and the quality has diminished. Today was not pleasant.. the chicken was bland, gravy juice was so funny that it completely leaked out before we got home. Disappointed, not that they will care.",
   "Best sesame chicken ever. I get it Everytime and it never disappoints. You get good portions for the lunch special plus you get soup, egg roll, and crab Rangoon. Clean and very friendly staff. Chicken is lightly breaded unlike hyvee. Much more quality and value compared to Hy-Vee Chinese.",
   "I order the food and have it delivered, when the person got to my door, my food fall out the bag, he say the paper already kind of wet when he picked up. So I call restaurant and let them know, they told me is not their fault,  after talks to them for few minutes on the phone. They told me to give all the food to the guy to bring it back and they will him get us the new one, an hours later, we never got our food! I can't believe this is how they treat the customer. Try to call them , they did not answer.",

   "Fresh delicious food! Much like Greek food with pitas, gyros, salads, wraps and basmati rice plates. Small place but definitely worth the visit!"
