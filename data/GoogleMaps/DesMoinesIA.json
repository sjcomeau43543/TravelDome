  "Nicely sized zoo. Open all year round with fun events. Zoo brew on Wednesday nights let you check out the animals up close with a drink in hand. Fun times!",
  "This is a great local zoo!      There are lots of exhibits to see, but it can still be covered in a couple of hours.\n\nWe visited on a mild winter day, and it was fantastic.    There was no crowd, and many of the animals were still active.   (Even the flamingos.)     There is a great indoor area and plenty of indoor viewing areas scattered outside to warm up in when needed.\n\nBe sure to visit Barnaby, the ~80 year old tortoise.      He was very active despite his age, walked up to greet us, and began playing with a ball.     Amazing!",
  "Great zoo. Even in the winter they have animals to see. I love that it is small enough to visit in about an hour. I don't need to be stuck halfway through a zoo with a tired 3 year old.",
  "It is a small zoo, but well worth seeing. My sister and I took her kids and we had a blast looking at all the animals. Especially the red  panda.",
  "Great zoo. Lots of well planned patches and exhibits. Not too large yet not a little hole in the wall zoo either."

  "The Botanical Garden has many different plants and activities. Take a class, listen to live music, complete crafts, or plant your own garden. Check their calendar for upcoming events. There are always staff or volunteers ready to answer questions you may have. They have classrooms open with activities for children to do. They offer guided tours on the weekend, or just take the time to walk on your own.",
  "Absolutely, completely LOVE this place. There were families playing Uno on the upper deck, children \"hunting\" for certain plants on a scavenger hunt, and people quietly sitting, reading a book while they absorbed the warmth, humidity, and light. This has become one of my favorite winter Iowa destinations, especially due to my \"winter blues\". It's an inexpensive therapy! Also, check out the back room. It's well hidden and lovely as well.",
  "So much fun!! It was so pretty, and a great way to escape snowy Iowa for a day!! The plants and flowers were gorgeous. Loved learning about the plants, it was educational yet super fun. It had great places for younger children to learn. It was very clean, and the volunteers/staff were extremely friendly!! Can't wait to go again!!!",
  "The plants all look cool. The inside is always larger in my memory, but there's plenty more around the perimeter. The views here are amazing as one would expect by the river and inside a gigantic glass dome. Check it out",
  "I grew up going to the Botanical Center and I was so glad to come back to some beautiful updates to the facility. It is open all week (including weekends) from 10 am - 5 pm. There's so much veriety in the main garden and interesting fun facts. The waterfall is always wonderful and relaxing to sit next to and the upper balcony has been updated as well (some water drops from condensation). The original display from the front entrance is next to the bathrooms along with some really beautiful artwork. Tucked back by the orchids is a beautiful greenhouse display where there are a million photo opportunities."

  "Very fun open area to walk around in, always something interesting to look at. Plenty of other places that are near by to go visit or eat at. Kid friendly, great spot for taking photos.",
  "Nice place to visit while in Des Moines, it's a free park, just find any parking spot and you are good to go. Fun for everyone.",
  "This is a unique collection of sculptures that will surprise you in downtown Des Moines. Nice setting and nice trendy food & drink nearby.",
  "So glad that Des Moines has this space. Nice local restaurants close by as well. Nice to take an hour with the kids for something to do. And it is free looks all day everyday!",
  "This place is incredible. Year round it looks nice, and the park keeps expanding with the space it has. It doesn't take much time to go through the entire park, but it makes a beautiful place to take food from the surrounding restaurants, or a nice place to read something from the nearby library. Speaking of which, everything surrounding the park is full of character and makes for a top notch experiance."

  "Iowa State Capitol is a wonderful place. I loved the hospitality they provide in there. The way they have decorated the history and kept it alive is beautiful. I want to thank Marcia! She is very kind and she has got a great knowledge of the history. I enjoyed and I got to explore a bunch of new things that I had never done till now. Thank you! I highly recommend people to visit the beautiful place. You will have wonderful experience!",
  "It's pretty good as far as capitals go. The gold is a nice touch with a lovely rotunda. It could use some updates as well as a better visitor entrance. The entrances are kind of hidden and appear as an afterthought, almost as if they are just stuck in wherever they fit instead of thinking of the visitor experience. Merchandise is reasonably priced but lacking in diversity of items.",
  "Wonderful tour of the Iowa State Capitol with the Ray Society. One of the painters (restoration artists) explained how they have restored the plaster and painted walls throughout the bldg. Very impressive. Beautiful wood carvings, mosaics tile floors  and carpets. Dana was an excellent tour guide. Very knowledgeable about Iowa history. Only 5 domed capitol bldg in US and covered in gold leaf.",
  "Beautifully preserved architecture throughout the Iowa State Capitol building. House of Representatives chambers are massive. Library is truly one-of-a-kind must see. Staff is gracious and welcoming. Great place to visit... just make sure to LOOK UP!!",
  "The Capitol was a great experience. We had two little ones with us so we didn\u2019t take the guided tour but we were still able to see almost everything. It has enough exhibits and things inside the building that you and the kids won\u2019t get bored. If you want to go up to the highest levels of the gold dome then you need a tour guide but other than that you can basically do everything yourself. There are a ton of neighboring sites adjacent to the grounds as well as a gorgeous view of the city from up above, a rare site in flat Iowa. Definitely glad we took the time to go, it\u2019s something we will return to visiting when the weather warms up."

  "Its always a motivation just to come out and mingle. Some of the best veggies crafts etc and love the wine tasting. Always spend more than I want and never stay on schedule when visiting so word of advice make it a day and stay ad long as you want a real plus.",
  "Such an amazing farmers market! We would drive 30 min every week to go, its huge and has everything. Must try croissants or scones and bread at La Mie, or a breakfast burrito and some coffee! It's got everything: produce, canned salsa/jams, cheese, wine, meats, honey, juice, bakeries, arts and crafts, music, dog treats, and so much more. It's clean, safe, tons of entertainment, and port-o-potties for families/littles. Great location in the middle of restaurants (as if u couldn't find deliciousness at the market itself), can walk the bridge across the river. Best farmers market we've ever been too, and we've lived in 9 states.",
  "Fantastic. Great place to walk around and interact with a wide group if people. From crafts, plants, food and everything in between. Was able to sample a lot of new food and took some home. Had some great stuffed fill pickles. There was beautiful music of all types. Everyone should check it out when ever possible. Truly amazing.",
  "I love the November and December Farmer's Market. Though I preferred the previous location, the 2019 market iwas very enjoyable. It would be 5 stars if they would limit strollers to umbrella type. Most parents were carrying children and using strollers as grocery carts.1 family had a stroller baby/bed combo the size of big box store grocery cart.",
  "Great people, one of the very best of Des Moines! Great for animals and children. We have some really talented vendors - awesome experience!"

  "Great place for a walk. Lots of trees and maybe you can see eagles or deer. I went to check our the new path to downtown. The bridge is nice but doesn't have great access for bicyclists at the north end. That narrow path is for bikes.",
  "Very nice park! So cool. You could skateboard, bike, run,  walk, and walk you dog here around the circle lake. Animal and kid friendly. There are two bridges. They have many chairs if you need to sit right in the front. Soo cool. Totally fun and a great way to get exercise! Awesome!! It's hard to get parking though.   But otherwise AWESOME trail.",
  "Great walking-biking trail, roughly 2 miles around Gray's Lake.  Parking in various lots around the lake.  Various Bike trails connecting to this trail.  Great brewery (Confluence), also adjacent to lake.",
  "Nice park. Can't wait to enjoy it more. The lake is great. They have a cool walking path. Enjoy.",
  "Such a wonderful public park. The nature trails and views are amazing. You can even get a great view of downtown. The bridge is beautiful. The staff at the desk are polite and helpful. The beach is kept clean during the summer time. Dogs are welcome. Waste cans everywhere to help us all keep it clean. VERY family friendly. Definitely another place to be proud of Des Moines for. \u2764\ufe0f"

  "I must say that the museum is exceptional and wonderful.  The atmosphere is incredibly calm and relaxed which allows you to appreciate all the pieces calmly and in your time.  The attention of the staff in all the rooms was first class, the ladies I asked for recommendations and information went beyond a simple instruction, which is quite appreciated because it shows that the staff loves their workplace.  The variety of pieces in the permanent exhibitions is amazing with pieces by international artists such as Picasso.  It has a restaurant inside the museum which allows you to enjoy a snack during your visit.  My recommendation is that you go on Thursdays as they close until late and it gives you the opportunity to observe the whole complex calmly.  Best of all, all this wonder is free!  So it is definitely a must-see gem when visiting Des Moines.\n\nDebo decir que el museo es excepcional y maravilloso. La atm\u00f3sfera es incre\u00edblemente tranquila y relajada lo que te permite apreciar todas las piezas con calma y a tu tiempo. La atenci\u00f3n del personal en todas las salas fue de primer nivel, las se\u00f1oritas a las que les pregunt\u00e9 recomendaciones e informaci\u00f3n para poder observar mejor las exposiciones fueron m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de una simple instrucci\u00f3n, lo que se aprecia bastante porque se nota que el personal ama su lugar de trabajo y se agradece una atenci\u00f3n sincera y amable. La variedad de piezas en las exposiciones permanentes es incre\u00edble contando con piezas de artistas internacionales y del nombre de talla como Picasso. Tiene un restaurante dentro del museo lo que te permite disfrutar de alg\u00fan aperitivo durante tu visita. mi recomendaci\u00f3n es que acudas en los jueves ya que cierran hasta tarde y te da la oportunidad de observar todo el complejo con calma. Lo mejor de todo es que toda esta maravilla es \u00a1gratis! as\u00ed que definitivamente es una joya imperdible al visitar Des Moines.",
  "The Des monies art center is a great place to see and experience,the building itself is a fantastic work of art! \u2764\ufe0fIt is for all ages to enjoy.you could easily spend two hours there \u2763\ufe0f \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\uddbc make sure to check out the lovely rose garden outside as well \ud83c\udf39 \ud83c\udf39",
  "Great place to unwind and really just retreat from the outside. The area is always quiet and easy to immerse oneself into the artwork. Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable and the area is kept clean. This place is a hidden gem.",
  "Visiting from New Orleans I was introduced to the Art Center by a relative who lives here in DMI (Des Moines  IA). I was greeted at the door by ver nice people.  I was so taken by the art I almost touch it but you're not supposed to. Do not touch I felt like a kid when the attendee warned me.  I really had a great time walking around on each floor it's a maze within its self.  Really cool for any occasion.  #BUTTAFLIBEST1AWARD \ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udfc6",
  "Such an underrated place.\n\nShowcases popular artists like Pablo Picasso, John Singer Sargent, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Grant Wood.\n\nAdmission has been free recently. The gift shop is one of my favorite places for gifts in Iowa. Please come here if you haven't already.\n\nEveryone here is nice and social."

  "This is a stunning place with amazing art as well as architecture and architectural craftsmanship. We visited today, Nov 12 and we went for the first tour. We had a wonderful and knowledgeable guide and we were the only ones there! A private tour! The guided tour is worth the extra expense as you will see more of the home and you will have docent guided tour with background and additional information. Whether you like textiles, paintings, pipe organs (amazing), sculpture or woodworking, you will delight in this amazing home. And we went with very cold weather and it was toasty warm! You will have stairs to climb. And there is parking. I cant say much about the gardens as it was all covered in a beautiful blanket of snow. This is a must see for locals and visitors. Enjoy!",
  "Beautiful home built in the 1920s designed to reflect the architecture and feel of a manor seen in Salisbury UK. The home is furnished worn some replicas and some authentic 16th century architecture and furnishings. Some of the paintings on the wall are quite gorgeous. Tours of the full house are only offered three times a day, but you can pay $8 to walk around the first floor only. I opted to self guided tour which ended up being very few rooms and the front garden.",
  "Phenomenal. Any one who loves history, England, or beauty should check it out. I was blown away. The story of the home and how it came to be is incredible to me. People with incredible sums of money these days would never build anything so amazing. A very unique find in the middle of Iowa.",
  "I've always adore this place since I was a child and my mother would take me. Fun half day activity for children 12 and up. Great little piece of history to partake in. Always great to go back for a visit. I recommend always looking at the website for time and date information though, because they do events that may interfere with regular business hours. If your ever in Des monies I highly recommend.",
  "We went to Mysteries at the Castle and had a great time with three of our kids. It was beautiful, fun and festive. The historic backdrop was delightful to show the kids and imagine with them how we would live there if it was our home. Will return to see the House when it is not a \"Castle\" :)"

  "This is a location I wish I could visit more often with my son. It's fun, interactive and provides plenty of creative freedom in terms of activities. As an avid astrophotographer I especially enjoyed the IMAX dome theater  with a presentation of the night sky. There are plenty of activities to keep one occupied for an entire day and there should still be something to enjoy next time.",
  "I love this place. It is/was my favorite place to be when I was a child and perhaps one of the early inspirations that led me to become the engineer that I now am. I would love for this place to grow, as it seems rather smaller than what I remembered as a child. In my honest opinion, the dome theater should be ditched and converted into an exhibit / virtual exhibit.",
  "My children and I frequently come to The Science Center. The exhibits are fun interactive and educational. Something to do for all ages.",
  "Fantastic Place for Kids!  Lots of hands on exhibits and a permanent Lego exhibit with large Lego models even adults can appreciate! Get your inner architect on with the build centers and test out some structures with the wind tunnel and the earthquake simulator!",
  "My daughter works at our local science center and wanted to stop here during our vacation to see what Iowa has to offer. What a great place. There is so many things to do and see. We had a great time here."

  "A beautiful building of purpose and great vision. Check the website for tours, and learn more about food security, along with some history of Des Moines. This used to be the old library, and comes with some stories as well!",
  "It is informative, but read Desert. It's available for free online and can be accessed easily. This should be renamed to the Norman Borlaug BJ museum for what this really is. It feels far too much like it wants to celebrate billionaire philanthropy, US imperial hegemony, all packaged as if they're objective facts. \"Norman Borlaug saved 1,000,000,000 lives. Wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans feed the most people across the world. The United States must accept a paternalistic role in the developing world.\"",
  "Wow! Beautifully restored old library. It is a museum and a hall of fame honoring the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. If you are into architecture this $29.8 million restoration project is definitely worth seeing!  The museum, located in the basement, is informative.  On the upper level there is a art room displaying works that relate to those that are honored in the Hall of Fame.  It is only open to the public on Tuesdays and Saturdays, but it is free.  I understand you can arrange a private tour on some other days during the week.  Located on the river, it is a must see if you are in Des Moines.",
  "Amazing building, wonderful story about growing food! I'm picky, but I can't say enough about this place! [I'm straight A in 3rd World Social Development & Change (Sociology/Socioeconomics - UCSB)] I just happened to be renting a studio apt across the street. Lived there for two years before I even noticed the place!  When I visited it the experience was paranormal it was such a coincidence. Like I was brought there by some spirit or something. Amazing gardens and landscape with lots of rabbits and the Des Moines River flowing behind it. I witnessed people catching and cleaning Alligator Gar fish off the bridge. You never see this in CA where I'm from. Best experience for me in Iowa, so far was the World Food Prize Hall.",
  "Love the architecture and the docent was very very helpful. The place is free and quite educational."

  "This is a nice walk and a suprisingly pleasent area.  Only 3 stars because Des Moines and much of the USA have this weird idea of isolating things rather than complimenting things.  This walk and the Asian park are isolated from other things.  In my humble opinion, the road the goes along the park near the Botanical center should accommodate businesses and shops.  A place to get a bite or a drink and/or some shops.  Its essentially a desert.  \n\nYou drive there.  You park.  You walk. That's it.  There is no place to get a bite or to shop.  Typical American desert of a park.",
  "Lots to see. Des Moines is most definitely on the map. Great place to exercise, relax, & site see....",
  "This was a very nice park and walking trail. \nThe bridge is spectacular!\nThe Chinese garden is awesome! \nThis is a hidden gem in Des Moines.\nWish is was warned to enjoy the park a little longer.",
  "Spent a lovely lazy afternoon strolling around beautiful DSM.",
  "A fairly recent artsy installation on the western bank of the Des Moines River in downtown Des Moines, right next to the western entrance to the iconic Iowa Women of Achievement Bridge.  When it first opened, there were a few more swings installed on the fishing pole, but when I visited this time, there was only one lonely swing left.  The park is nicely lit at night and adds a more \"fun\" element to the river front space in downtown."

  "One of our family favorite weekend walk area. Such a nice scene with flowers blooming in the spring, rock garden, river view, fall season also look amazing here, too. I really amaze at the architecture and designed of this place. Walking distance to botanical garden, women of achievement bridge, rotary riverbank park. I hope we raise enough fund to fix this place and get the ponds to work properly with Iowa weather. I think it's will look a lot better with the ponds and waterfalls completed.",
  "Cool place to pull over and walk through. The pagoda is quite beautiful and affords a scenic view of the city across the river.",
  "I'm sure it was beautiful at one time, but it's in a bit of disarray. With cleanup and straightening on the items in the garden in would be really nice. The location on the river is great.",
  "It's a very pretty scenery to walk by on. But the river definitely worth walking by and viewing and makes for a pleasant walk. Also close to some other items to explore as well. May need some maintenance and weeding should be done but it was around fall areas and it wasnt bad. Overall the actual area is  cleaned and pretty.",
  "Such a surprise to fin. Lovely little park to walk through. Peace and tranquility"

  "$5 donation for adults / $2.50 donation for kids 12 or younger. Tours are about an hour long. Includes short video on history of Terrace Hill and tour of first first 2 floors. Our your guide was very engaging and funny. Would recommend for anyone who wants to learn more about Iowa's history.",

  "Definitely a fun location to take all ages during the summer.  They have rides for nearly anyone and they have a waterpark on-site.\n   If you can afford to spring for the cost of Adventureland Inn and plan on staying the night it's worth it.  The trolley to and from the park that runs every 15 minutes or so is great.  You also save on parking doing it that way. The hotel has 2 pools and a sports bar inside that offers a great, affordable breakfast.  It's also a solid place for dinner but obviously there's cheaper hotels in the area.  But also plan ahead because the rooms can fill up fast.\n   Since it's not one of the bigger parks the lines are typically much shorter.  Shorter lines make for a much better experience without having to pay extra for fast passes to get a quick line wait time.  This is definitely our goto amusement park but once our kids are a bit older we'll probably venture to a more exciting location with bigger attractions.  For younger kids Adventureland is great though.  I cant imagine the impatience in contrast.",
  "Enjoy and hang on. Love the live shows, wave pools and slides. The Monster is worth the wait and the Phoenix was so much fun.  I would recommend buying your tickets online though because you can usually save a little money and you don't have to wait in line for tickets. The lockers for rent are very small, far to small to be practical.  I wouldn't have thought of amusement park as event space, but it was pretty cool being on the park grounds without a trillion other people. They have added a racetrack with mechanical horses that goes around a track.",
  "I stay over. So hang at the wave pool then get some eats and back to the room come out later enjoy walking around and maybe hit a ride or 2. Prices are right and look for the coupons. Advetureland in consistent and friendly great staff.",
  "Went with a group of four for the day. We had a lot of fun and got a chance to do almost everything. I do wish they would open a few ride for adults who dont love huge rides. My wife gets sick on roller coasters and feels she can only ride baby ride with the lack of other options. I hope they see this and maybe look into one for adults that's not so extreme.",
  "The best destination for fun in the sun and thrills. Close to hotels shopping and Casino.  Save on parking by parking at hotel and riding the free shuttle.  Pack a picnic lunch for a mid day break. Enjoy and hang on.  Love the live shows, wave pools and slides.  Great family fun with discounted tickets at local grocery stores"

  "Wide variety of exhibits, from war memorabilia, to movies filmed in the state and more modern events, as well as history on the states expansion and development. Lots of history and items relating to the civil war, including personal effects of generals and soldiers who were from Iowa. Admission to the museum is free and there is a cafe located on the third floor.",
  "Many interesting expositions about the history and culture in Iowa from various historic periods. Free entrance was a surprise.",
  "I hadn't been here since I was a kid--what a mistake! My wife and son and I were just enthralled with the in-depth exhibits covering coal mining (as you walk through an elaborate coal mine), the Civil War, and the pre-European history of Iowa and much more. The Civil War exhibit really affected me; it really showcased the personal costs of the war. I will have to come back on my own to spend a day going through everything more thoroughly. We went with a big group of kids (ages 3-11) for 2 hours, and they had a great time as well."

  "They really did a great job revamping this. I remember it was mainly an area for homeless people to hang out and usually bathe or soak. Brings in good food trucks now.",
  "LOVE COMING HERE WITH MY CHILDREN!  Its beautiful at night and in the daytime, and there's a place to sit for adults or kids who dont want to play in the water.",
  "Wonderful place to break for lunch. Nice fountain.",
  "Not like the old days but still pretty. And relaxing. Was a great backdrop for when I took my daughters senior photos."

  "Love walking around this park. Some ice fishing in the winter and will be fun to swim at the beach in the spring. There is a great dog park, softball fields, archery.",
  "Great place to take the family for a quiet and fun day. Playgrounds are clean and have many options for the kids to play on and keep busy. They have some good trails to walk on as well as run and bike. Lots of wild life roaming the woods. The trails have porta potties on them for ease of bathroom use. Very clean and well kept park. Good parking options and access to boat ramp and beach is a plus.",
  "We love going to this place! Never had a bad experience! Its huge as well, they have a small and a large dog area but most people just use the large dog area. Its 20$ a year so it's pretty cheap and you need to supply your dogs shot record which is nice and reassuring! Only problem is, sometimes after it rains there's a lot of bugs. But other than we've had a great time!",
  "One of the nicest, cleanest, well rounded parks I've been too. The trail around the lake is great to walk or run. The beach is perfect for kids and adults. And there's a busy house being built on the other end. Can't wait.",
  "Always enjoy bringing our dogs here to walk. Plenty of open space and places to explore."

  "Walnut Woods State Park is as hidden gem. It is local and a beautiful location to be part of nature. The bird blind is a particularly wonderful aspect. To sit and watch the large number of feeders draw birds of all kinds, sizes, colors and with unique calls. Just give yourself a gift. Hike the trails, watch the birds and calm yourself.",
  "The lodge is beautiful and can be rented for events. There are plenty of camp sites with power. The hiking trails are well maintained and offer views of the Racoon River. This is my favorite cross country skiing place after fresh snow. I would also say this is the best first day hike, as the snacks, hit cocoa, and REI folks are fantastic! A boat ramp is available and there are two entrances, with plenty of parking along the park drive. The newer playground features a rock with climbing, swings, sand, however it's in the sun and quite hot in the summer.",
  "Same great place. Just a few road changes since 1995.",
  "Very beautiful campgrounds, the beautiful trees. Very well kept grounds. Very peaceful. Bbq and picnic tables at every site.",
  "We went to a party in the lodge (Western area) and loved it.  Nice heated space and fire in the winter and open outdoor area for warmer weather. Of course the woods are great for a hike.  Big space right in the city."

  "I actually came here for a photograph of Boston which ultimately came out stellar. It's a relatively well known spot for photographer's looking to get an image of Boston and it doesn't disappoint. It's a great park, well worth a walk around. If you park in the lot and you plan on getting a sunset photo, be careful, they do lock the gates after dark.",
  "This park amazed me! It is so lovely. My children ages 3 and 4 absolutely LOVED it. This was one of those parks I had to bribe them to leave. There is parking and restrooms. They also have beautiful walking trails and after playing on the park we took a nice walk just the 3 of us and our pup love. My children made it through the entire trail and loved it. I left my phone and was a little nervous but felt safe enough to walk through the trail with kids. Not being from the area makes me nervous to go on hikes without my husband but here we felt safe and the beautiful hand built bridges over little water ways and an easier trail to take for the kids and I. Will definitely go back!",
  "The kidlettes love this park.  It is highly maintained and the traffic (child count) stays relatively low.  It is the perfect park for kids of the younger sizes 2-5 and for bigger kids too 6-9ish. Bathroom facilities, swings, acres of manicured fields, local biking trails in/near the nearby woods, and disc golf adjacent the property.  There is a smaller secondary park across the highway (geared toward 4+) that is a great overflow playground, field, parking, etc.  \n\nIn the early mornings the park is usually very clean.  The ground crew mow early and frequently and are usually done by about 9am or so.  Occasionally a raccoon or two will get in the garbage, but very very rare.  Not a ton of seating , so bring a chair or blanket.  Also, if anyone reading this happens to have a spare plastic steering wheel, the park is missing two child's play steering wheels.\n\nOh hey, almost forgot; on one occasion,  someone dumped a truck load of used tires in the nearby creek adjacent the pedestrian bridge.  Not an issue that is too alarming for the Southside of DSM, but I here is the kicker; on a separate occasion (unrelated), open alcohol containers and an alarming number of crushed pills and residue were left on the green table under the walkway.   So that's a thing .\nMosquitoes too.\n\nLastly, make sure to assess the stacked hexigons as they accumulate water after rainfall.  Just FYI.\n\n99% of the time this park is great.  Give it a shot. \ud83d\ude42",

  "Wine samples were small compared to other Iowa wineries I have visited.  The two I sampled were enjoyable. I purchased a glass for $7...that seemed a bit high.  Also they charge a corkage fee if you want to enjoy a bottle of their wine on premise. That was an incentive not to buy and enjoy there...that corkage fee was a first for me. I did purchase a bottle to enjoy at home.",
  "A beautiful space, helpful staff, and delectable wines make this a perfect getaway for a date and some time to connect.",
  "Beautiful location for weddings and events! Been there multiple times for the Amazing Wedding Race and it's loads of fun! Great staff and delicious \ud83c\udf77 wine! Looking forward to Officiating here!",
  "Excellent winery with beautiful grounds great wine and convenient location!",
  "As a group, we felt completely unwelcomed and rushed through the tasting. Had to keep reminding server that we hadn't been served from the bottle she was rushing to put away. Samples were served in plastic cups, and the amount was so small it barely covered the bottom of the cup - very difficult to give it a good sniff or 2-3 sip tasting! Personally did not enjoy any of the wines (whites/ros\u00e9s very sweet). First winery visit (of many) where I chose not to purchase a bottle(s). Outdoor grounds pretty, good sized patio."

  "It's sad to watch a snowman melt... and messy.  Even so there were a few hearty Iowans attempting to enjoy the remnants of winter at Sleepy Hollow in spite of the slush and mud.  The workers I encountered were friendly.  The chalet looks nice.  Given another 12 inches of snow it might be worth the price.",
  "I would say five stars, except that it cost sixty-nine bucks just for me and my Daughter to get through the gate.  That left me with very little cash for vendors.  Neither the event nor most of the vendors take credit cards.  If the park took credit cards (or charged a reasonable amount at the gate) I could have used my cash to buy souvenirs. I have several Friends who bend at Sleepy Hollow and they didn't make much (partially because of the turn-out, probably due to weather, but also because they charge exhorbitantly for vendor space, too).  Otherwise, it was a five star experience.\n\nSuggestion:  Let vendors vend outside of the gate in the space between the bridge and the entrance and/or in the parking lot just before the bridge, too & charge them like half the amount.  That way patrons could shop on the way in and out...",
  "I think Sleepy Hollow is awesome, especially for Iowa (we really don't have too many places like this so it's very nice). In the winter, you can go snowboarding or tubing down their huge hill with a lift that takes you back up. They have go-cart racing, mini-golf, and many other fun family activities!! I'm excited to go back out there to experience anything new. \nThey also have events for holidays and such. One event I will be attending every year is the Renaissance Faire! Always held in September, and it's very fun. They have an AMAZING Halloween event as well; the last time I attended was a few years back, but it had 3 main attractions and they were super scary and super fun!! In the winter they have the activities named above (might have new things now too!).",
  "Over all this place has some potential. The staff I engaged with was extremely nice. It was very once that they have everything you need there, including boots for a few extra dollars. \n\nOnly half the area had snow on it. I was told it's because it has been to warm and they needed it to be below 27 degrees to make snow. I found this odd because it has been below that temp for several days prior to visiting. They still charge full price even though only half of the place is available. \n\nIt seemed a little crowded because of the lack of snow, but lots of people. The slope was a little aggressive for young beginners and I seen a few people, including my son get hurt. If they had more snow and some beginner/learning slopes that would have been helpful. \n\nWould I go back? Sure, but not anytime soon, maybe if we are back in the area next year.",
  "The renaissance festival is a great experience,  with a lot to offer for kids and adults.  Food and drinks are delicious and only slightly pricey at $5 a drink and $9 for a Turkey leg. So much to see and do you can't fit it all into a single day!\nOrder of Wrath live steel fighting was the best event, in my opinion.  Where many of the other shows feel scripted, these warriors clash in a live, gladiator style arena that I felt was the most realistic and exciting show of the day! The joust was worth checking out as well, and interacting with the friendly characters throughout the festival really makes the experience unique."

  "Cannot rate this place highly enough. A fantastic area for children of all ages. My son is 15 months and he had a blast. I'm excited to see how the upcoming projects come out.",
  "Love this place and so does my daughter! It's still in the process of growing and it's not as fancy and flashy as other museums in the area, but it is ran with love and care. SO much to do and lots of new play stations developed thoughtfully. This place is a labor of love and truly a grassroots effort that is much needed in the Des Moines area. Give it a try, it's a wonderful and inexpensive way to spend a rainy/cold day!",
  "Great place to spend a couple hours away from home!  Lots of fun spaces for kids to play and use their imaginations!  Cost is 4.50 per child ages 1-10.  The toys are changed out daily so there's always something new to play with.  There's also a party room in back.",
  "small enough to be able  see  all the areas without losing site of the grandbabies, diverse enough to appeal to all interests of young children.  I took my 4 yr old grandson and 2yr old granddaughter, they had sooo much fun."

  "One of my favorite places to visit in Des Moines! A rich history of the state and great historical perspectives of Iowa High School activities!",
  "New volleyball display is amazing as are videos displayed in the 360 room. Hall of Pride is a fun interactive way to learn about Iowa.",
  "I really enjoyed my visit in this place! I learned a lot about the people of Iowa through the interactive activities. I will definitely recommend this place.",
  "The Rueben was great & I got a great dude salad!",
  "The Hall is ok, but there's a lot of walking and elevators can be difficult to find for those needing one."

  "It was a fascinating tour of a historical home. The people who lived there and the fact that the home still exists are what's important here & of interest. The tour is very interesting and the guide I had was very knowledgeable. I'd recommend checking it out if you have time. Just try not to draw comparisons to Salisbury House or Terrace Hill.",
  "Great tour guides!  So informative.   Great for groups traveling from other countries, too!",
  "The house is unassuming from the outside but has a wealth of history inside. I took my younger son on a tour with me. He really likes history so he enjoyed it. I don't think it would be of interest to children that don't like history. There are two factors in play with this house. First, it was one of the first houses in the area. Second, it was discovered that the house was on the underground railroad. I would highly recommend this tour for people interested in one or both of those topics. The tour guide was very knowledgeable.",
  "Tour hostess was very interesting and really explained a lot of the small Victorian details.  Our 12 and 16 year olds enjoyed it too!",
  "Has a connection to the Underground Railroad. Original owner helped found Valley Junction."

  "Calming. If you have questions staff available to onswer. Only open to public Friday noon to 2.",
  "It was a bit difficult to find at first since our GPS took us to the main building across the street. Thankfully, we read a review here that advised this and we found it right away. A lovely oasis in the cities center and so many gorgeous new blooms! Definitely a must stop if you are in the area! Staff was friendly and very helpful.",
  "Beautiful place to read, eat lunch, and stroll. Plus, they have experts there to answer questions and show you around. Would definitely recommend! They're only open for a couple of hours on Fridays (12-2) in the summer but it's well worth the trip over!",
  "Beautiful oasis in the center of town",
  "Excellent place to relax wonderful people to answer questions"

  "Huge upgrade in parking lot since Veteran's Pkwy was finished! Trail upkeep is only fair,  and the signage inconsistent and confusing. Props for having an audio tour! May I suggest a porta potty on the far end of the trail also?  Even so,  a hike on March 8th in 70 degree weather....AWESOME!",
  "Beautiful 548 acres of timberland in SW Des Moines.  Sadly, there are invasive plant species needing groomed out.  Mostly Vines and honeysuckle.  It's choking the trees and causing fauna to nest too close to the ground. In turn the creatures are too close to predators.  Come spend a couple hours on Saturdays from 10am - noon and help the Polk County Conservation staff clean it up.",
  "Beautiful, free nature trails with an abundance of wild flora and fauna.\n\nThere are several miles of looped hiking trails and a nice restroom area at the entrance. During our trip, we waved at a number of other friendly trailblazers along the way.\n\nHighly recommended!",
  "This is my favorite hiking spot on Des Moines! Be aware of the bugs during certain times of the year, but otherwise, no matter the season, these trails have the best views of greenery and nature and not too far to travel to get there.",
  "We weren't actuality in Brown's Woods but at the dedication of the Folded Flags veterans tribute. This is a new sculpture consisting of 15 accurately modeled folded flags in honor of our nation's military veterans. They light up at night and are very cool to go see."

  "We must have come on an off day. Not many people around. The printing press and blacksmith were VERY informative and talkative\n The general store employee said 'let me know if you have any questions' and silence. The woman in one of the houses said 'no I don't live here I just pretend to for 5 hours then I go home '\nI guess I was expecting to be more immersed with role playing and a learning experience. \nI mostly just walked around reading signs, which was disappointing.\n\nThe tractor driver was great too!",
  "Very fun for all ages. Worth going to if you love history",
  "Takes you back to a time long ago! Extremely cool for adults and kids alike, we always see & learn something new!",
  "We brought our kids here a few years ago, when they were just 6 and 4 years old.  We all loved it!  What an amazing way to learn about some of our nation's history!",
  "I had the benefit of visiting the farms about 37 years ago when they were truly \"living history\". The people employed there were required to live and work as if they existed during the era they were portraying. So you got a real picture of life then, and they could answer questions for us about the tasks they were performing . Not so anymore. What's more, the people visiting had a sense of the worth of the kind of museum experience they were witnessing. They appreciated it. Not so anymore. I saw alot of students there with 1 teacher for 30 kids. Not behaving. No respect for others. Teachers helping kids pee next to the trail instead of using the restrooms. Kids taking things that had been placed as examples of tools used in the era. Extremely disappointing. I wonder what happened? Is this just another example of how the latest grown generation has little use or appreciation for why we used to teach our children manners and respectfulness?"

  "Quite an amazing public park! Kids will love the play areas!  My own kids have dubbed the slide the fastest one they've ever seen! Some beautiful walking trails surround the park and there are numerous Play areas where kids can explore! This park really has something for everyone.",
  "This park is amazing. One of our favorites. A wonderful walking trail, multiple playgrounds in different locations, a pound. And so much more It\u2019s a great park for kids of all ages.",
  "Great little Ball Park lots of parking,  4 fields back to back , Soccer fields,  snack bar, bathrooms, play grounds,  plenty of parking 3 parking lots in the park and right next to the fields is a play ground for the little ones. Grocery store couple blocks away within walking distance for a long day in the park. Some tree shading areas around the ball fields which was a major plus especially for long days at the ball fields even days lol. Great place to hold adult softball tournaments,  but most of all youth travel ball tournaments great on site staff very friendly and helpful...No ATM onsite but take debit and credit cards for the snack bar reasonabley priced. Fields are pretty big,  takes a Big bat to Go Yard... Overall pretty good complex and we'll taken care of. Sorry and a skate park...",
  "When I grew up here in Urbandale (left 42 yrs ago), we had minimal park development, probably very little money available, dumpy Little League facilities. Now, parks and trail system here are impressive in comparison, sculptures especially. If residents were only as friendly as they were back in the '70s... I feel like a stranger here for sure.",
  "Fun place for kids to play. Nice playground. Big slides was popular for both kids and grown-ups."

  "Very fun experience! I went with coworkers who have not experience an escape room before either, and we all had the best time. We decided even before leaving the place that we will be coming back! Be prepared for a challenging hour (or less if you're lucky). Great way to build teamwork and work together to accomplish a rewarding end result.",
  "Best escape experience in Des Moines, hands down! We did the informant, and Cheyenne our guide, was amazing!",
  "This place is fantastic, and they were very flexible with us when we ended up booking the same room as another group of strangers. We had a blast figuring out clues though we definitely needed some help along the way. The staff is really nice and friendly and fun, and the room we got was aesthetically awesome! The rules were straightforward though the clues varied in difficulty. In the end, we escaped The Phantom with only one minute to spare! I'm excited to go back and try future rooms.",
  "Harrison and Renea were amazing and helpful guides. There were 4 of us who did the Informant. The amazing guides made sure we were never stumped too long without revealing answers. This is my first time I've actually escaped a room and I felt incredibly accomplished! Well worth the money for a heart racing, cleverly designed escape room! I can't wait to go back!",
  "We were here on a Friday night to celebrate my boys' birthdays. You need to make reservations for the timeframe you'd like (you get an hour for $25/person). We were able to get an 8:30 slot on Friday night, the day before we were going. Tickets are non-refundable, so plan well. 5-7 slots are available per room.\n\nGabe chose the hardest room, The Phantom. It has a 35% escape rate. We all had to sign waivers and promise not to damage things in the room. Then off to two videos about 2 or three minutes a video. One for safety and the other to set up the premise of the room. We were guided to the room, told we had unlimited hints and away we went. This room was waaay harder than we thought. In the hour, we got about halfway through all the puzzles to be solved, and we had decided to divide and conquer. This was our first time ever in an Escape Room and hindsight says we might have wanted to start on a different room as it took us a bit to orient ourselves and figure out where we needed to go first. \n\nBut it was a blast!"

Smoking section has more of a draw as it has the flashier machines up front. Whatever you decide to bet whether pennies to dollars I'm sure you can find a game to try your luck at. \n\nAlso they have card games such as blackjack and poker, roulette, craps and digital versions of all games.",
  "Love the new Sports Book! Been waiting so long! Glad Iowa wasn't last like usual. Looking forward to Poker online! Would be great for the state of Iowa. William Hill was definitely the way to go. Have used many sports book and by far they hands down are the best. Live lines by far are the best of any  Sports Books I've used (and this girl tried a lot!) Prairie Meadows has been a great thing for the community and love the expansion.",

  "Check in was suppose to be at 4. I arrived a little after that and had to wait until after 5 before my room was ready. They did apologize but at a place like this they could have made me feel a little better about it by offering a complimentary breakfast or something since my room was already steeply discounted by my company. The stay was good otherwise.",

  "Copper Creek Lake is a very nice lake with a well paved walking, and bike, path.\n\nMy family goes here a couple times a week just to get some sun and fresh air, and to let our daughter play on the playground for a little bit.\n\nThe only downside is that the walking path along the lake does not offer very much shade, so there are lots of times where you can get very warm very quickly, so make sure to stay hydrated.",
  "The only thing that would make this place better would be if there was a port-a-potty at the north end of the lake. With so parents that take there little ones there it's hard to get them all the way back to the restroom area without them having an accident. Just a thought.",
  "Great place to get out and enjoy the sunshine, walk the dog, jog, or play with your kids. A bit of country in the city!",
  "Great looking park with a stocked \"lake.\" Very peaceful walk around on the path which is a good length around. Perfect for a meditation setting."

  "I was attending an activity here. There are cabins shelters playground and plenty of space to play for a large group. Plenty of nearby shade trees lawn kept well.",
  "It was a good park, but they didn't have a basketball court for the boys so the kids had to do something else",
  "This is the city park that time forgot. It used to be a very popular place for family outings but for some reason the crowds all forgot about it. Sure, there are still a few people who know about it, but there's plenty of room for those who can find. It's beautifully kept, with huge, ancient pines, picnic tables and a shelter, plus playground equipment for the kids. Pioneer Park is an island of serenity in the heart of the Southside."

  "Great playground for parents of young children. Very shaded with giant cottonwood trees, big picnic pavilion.",
  "Chamberlain Park is a nice park just outside of downtown Des Moines.\n\nThere is a playground, a swing set, and a shelter.\n\nThe downsides are that there is not much parking besides on the street, and I didn't see a bathroom.\n\nBut probably the biggest upside is that there is plenty of shade, which is good for hot days.",
  "Hidden gem. Didn't know it was there, but a very nice well kept park",
  "There was trash there. Liquor bottles on the ground.",
  "Great little park WITH SHADE! Almost always has other kids to play with. Couple downsides though. There's a broken (fenced off,) slide that hasn't been fixed yet and sometimes there's loiterers. \nUPDATE: I haven't seen any loiterers near the playground for quite some time. (Hooray!) Lately there's been lots of happy use from this park. The parents and kiddos who visit are generally very nice and polite"

  "Nice place to take your dog.  Well kept, nice dog owners attend, never had an incident.  Worth every penny of the dog pass.",
  "Ewing was relatively clean and has an interesting slope design to it, so your pup will wear out faster due to running uphill consistently. The back half of the yard is flatland, so easy for people to walk around on. The only takeaway from here is there's no bins to dispose of waste bags inside the fencing. Just one way out in the parking lot upon entry.",
  "We love the big open park that is available for our dogs to run and socialize. There is such a great group of people and dogs that are there. Poop bags are available. Water and bowls for drinks!!!",
  "Very beautiful place and peaceful"

The city skyline is beautiful. They also built that new shelter out there. I would give it five stars if they had playground equipment for the kids.",
  "Looks like the park is starting to clean up really nice. New overlook of downtown and what looks to be a new lake they are digging out.",
  "Love the upgrades. Still need some more work, but still worth taking the family for a nice outing and picnic",
  "EMC Overlook, within the park, has a wonderful view of downtown. There's a 1 way driveway that goes thru the park. Definitely a unique place to take out of town friends and family! Check it out!",
  "a nice small park. Lots of big oak trees on rolling hills. Lots of improvements underway to enjoy soon."

  "We went later in the day, was sprinkling but as soon as we arrived the rain drops had stopped. My son is an only child and the other kids that were there were very polite and friendly played with my son. The other parents seemed very nice and it wasn't so crowded. Perfect amount of people and kids!",
  "It's an ok park, perfect for playing disk golf and a nice picknick spot. The playground isn't the best.",
  "I really like this little city park.  It has a nice 9 hole disc golf course, which is very inviting to new players. The course is not too intrusive to the other activities the park offers.",
  "Great place for family fun. The locals might overpower the pool area and parking is quite limited. The grand kids like it though, and that's what matters! \ud83c\udfca"

  "It was so fun to get outside and explore the wilderness. I liked that I could go in the direction I choose.",
  "Nice little state park with very nice trails and a couple playgrounds.",
  "It's a good place in general but the trails need to be maintained more because of the main way to get to the park the bridge is no longer there if there was a bridge.",
  "Nice park! We read there was hiking so we tried it out. One suggestion would be to have trail signage. We're looking forward to going back in the fall when the mosquitoes hopefully won't be as bad."

  "Fun place to camp.  Lots of trees no matter what camping spot you choose.  Firepits.  Firewood for sale.  Showers.  Had a great time.  Highly recommend if you want a nice place to camp that is family friendly.  Will definitely be back.",
  "Attended a Polk County Conservation lecture on Pelicans at the nature center. It was very informative, and taught by an authoritative naturalist.  The nature center is terrific, and has plenty of other things for small children to do. (Only a clueless baffoon would bring a toddler to a one hour lecture.)"

  "Oh, Yeah! This place is great. If you are bored of flat Iowa try the coal miners daughter trail (2 miles) and come back on the new ed beach trail and then use the road to get to the parking lot (about .75 miles total). Try the extra credit trail if you think you won't get lost on the most winding trails in the park. Hiking on the island in the middle of the north lake was really cool, first you go on the water front and then up on the ridge.",
  "Love it, secluded place of peace and tranquility. It is a great place for admiring nature, photography fishing, having a picnic, relaxing, you can bring your boat, canoe, bike.",
  "Nice little state park, the only bad thing I can say is the bugs were horrible",
  "Gorgeous park with a lovely loop to view the water.  Nice hiking trails and paved bike path. Plenty of places to fish or just relax and enjoy lots of wildlife. ONLY downside is having to listen to that damn firing range.",

  "Super nice park, checks all the boxes (and then some):\n- Dedicated parking lot with plenty of parking\n- Nice-sized shelter\n- Public restrooms\n- One tennis court\n- Full-sized basketball court\n- Wide open spaces with what appears to be a baseball/softball field backstop\n\nAlso, the two playground structures both looked to be full of functional things to do (slides and ladders of varying sorts) with a good differentiation where one was clearly for younger kids and the other would work well for older kids.",
  "This park has a bit of everything. Basketball court. Tennis court. Ballfield area. And good playground area (toddlers-elementary age) with wood chips in the ground. There is even a good size shelter with two rows of picnic tables. A grill for charcoal next to the shelter. Men's and women's public restroom. Great for walks or jogging. Hidden in a nice residential neighborhood. I don't live in this area but I envy those who do. Will diffently spot by if in the area again. ",

  "Great fun for family outing! Jason Brown on stage was awesome, plenty of food vendors (even a gluten free option!) Bounce house for the kids! Be advised that everything costs between $2-6, including bounce house and obstacle course. Bring cash! We had a great time. Very unique experience if you've never done it before.",
  "Peaceful place to watch balloons when they come around",
  "It was awesome the balloons were great there was a lot of them it was well worth going and the night glow was the best the kids got to go down on the field and got cards from the ballonist.  I recommend this to any one it was awesome, awesome. Lots of good places to eat there to. All around a 10 thanks for a great time.",

  "My kids enjoy this park nice pool in the summer",
  "Not a bad small park. Clean and some what well kept. Parking is a bit tight but you can still make it happen. Everything the kids wanted to do was right there. Small playground and a few other things made it a good place to run around for a bit amd burn off energy.",

  "Great place to spend a couple hours. Lots of activities for the kids and they love picking their pumpkins out at the end!",
  "Well we found our way to kick of fall! So much fun! The kids absolutely love it. The apple cider was amazing. We got some apple pie and ice cream which was also delicious. We had a great time doing the maze and playing the games. They have a great playground for the kids while the adults play games or relax and watch sunset on the swings. I can\u2019t wait to go back. It was awesome that everything was included in admission and food was reasonably priced. The kids loved the giant slide, and the air pillow. It was amazing! I highly recommend this place to anyone. This will definitely be our new family tradition.",
  "This place is so much fun for not only families but a group of friends! There is food, corn maze, activities and lots of pumpkins. Definitely check this place out if you are wanting to enjoy the Fall weather!",
  "Lots of fun activities for families! I do wish there were attendants making sure people were being safe. A giant woman was on the jump pad and fell into my daughter injuring her to the point we had to leave. Not really the farms fault...some people are just clueless."

  "Very important NWR of some the last remaining natural prairie. To the untrained eye it might not look like much, but this ecosystem is just an important as any other to our environment. Nicely maintained public information center and friendly staff.",
  "Such great displays, so much hands on education, lots of viewing opportunities, plus a great drive around the park with elk and bison too!",
  "We love Neal Smith! We love seeing the elk and buffaloes and we especially love the indoor area! There is so much to do for kids (and adults) of all ages. Bonus: It's all free! Our kids especially like the scavenger hunt bags for outside and the the puppet theater!",
  "I wish I had known about this place when I lived in Iowa because I would have visited it often. They have a great range of trails and outdoor activities as well as some awesome inside displays.\n\nWe volunteered for Prairie seed cleaning which was lots of fun and very interesting. If you're around and have time they have lots of opportunities for volunteers.",
  "The history and restoration of the native plants brings insight into today's healthy lifestyle of organic, fresh foods.  There is a larger than expected herd of free roaming buffalo.  There is elk as well; however we were unable to locate them on the 8,000 acres during our visit."

  "Amazing food and great service! Very charming atmosphere. Simon always walks around and checks in with everyone which makes you feel like a regular or right at home. Everything I\u2019ve tried here is delicious but especially that artichoke dip!",
  "Just ate at Simons for the first time tonight.  There was a huge line to get in and on a Tuesday night that is a good sign or so I thought.  The atmosphere is a little dark with some odd paintings but they have some cool lights which increases the ambiance.  Once we got seated the waitress was there to get our drink orders.  When she brought us our drinks we placed our food order.  We got garlic cheese bread for out appetizer, salad with house dressing and stuffed chicken.  The food was ok but under seasoned.  Nothing was bad just not memorable.  At the end of our meal we got a free piece of chocolate cake and just like the rest of the meal it was okay.  We may come back to try Simons again but it won't be for a while if we do.",
  "The food here is incredible and the experience is even better!! The owner is one of the most genuine people you'll ever meet and they treat you like family. This is THE best food in town and considerably under priced. The flavor will exceed your expectations every time. I can't say enough great things about this place!",
  "I love this place! If you want great food and upscale  dining experience in a small neighborhood setting, this is your place. Simon the owner is always there and will greet you when you come in and will walk you to the door on the way out. This is nice personal service and his patrons are loyal fans. If there is a line for waiting he knows exactly when you came in so it's never a problem and no need to put your name on a list. \nThe food is incredible, its high dining experience at very reasonable cost. Its ideal for a date setting as it's very cozy and comfortable. The place has a rustic feel with a splash of modernism. Lighting is low and atmosphere is welcoming. So if you are looking for incredible food and a cozy atmosphere without the price tag please visit Simon's. Wait til you see what's for dessert \ud83d\ude09",
  "Amazing... Like always. Just go! Be patient if there's a wait, you'll be grateful you did!"

  "Excellent service! Amazing professionally cooked food! Definitely a great bargain and top level fine dining experience.",
  "Tried it out based on the reviews. Excellent place to go. High end restaurant, with great prices. High serving. Would recommend to anyone. Their pickles spears are homemade. Their tomato basil soup with tortellini was the best, I never had tomato soup that good before. I would recommend the soup.",
  "Family lunch. Great waitress Janelle or Chanelle. Wonderful onion rings and my Kill Bill Tenderloin was delicious! Pleasant chat with the manager and he was very much involved with the staff. He even cleaned the table next to us and was patient with our questions. One of my favorite places to dine.",
  "The fries are fresh potatoes sliced and fried topped with a few pinches of salt. It is DELICIOUS! The chicken is crispy and taste SO good. Lastly the sundae was AMAZING. vanilla ice cream with creamy crunchy chocolaty goodness with delicious nuts throughout it. The best part about it is that its topped with toasted marshmallow covering the goodness until you start eating it.",
  "Nice place for a date or other event. Has nice outdoor eating area. Perfect three months of the year. Everything on the menu is pretty good."

  "We made an early dinner reservation and had excellent service from the staff. The hostess was really helpful and our server Leviathan was very attentive and personable.\n\nAbsolutely order the hot brown and fried pickles, both were delicious. I got the waffle and fried chicken which was also really yummy. We were celebrating our 3 year anniversary and Bubba's comped our dessert (peanut butter icebox pie was phenomenal). Thank you for the dessert and helping us celebrate this special occasion and of course, for the great service and food! We'll be back :)",
  "Nice place to celebrate birthday! Shown are 2 piece chicken with sides of Cole slaw  and cream corn. Also shrimp and grits. Group also had chicken pot pie., Kentucky hot brown sandwich and chicken fried steak. All enjoyed!! Great drink selection too",
  "Even though we had a large party we still had great service. Very friendly staff. We tried 6 different appetizers and they were all excellent. Especially the mac and cheese bites. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was great. Not too greasy and nice seasoning. The waffle was huge and delicious with the honey butter. Had the whiskey pecan pie for dessert. It was phenomenal.",
  "Great first visit.  We don't get downtown too much these days but this place is worth a special trip. The service was perfect I didn't even really look at the menu too much I just asked her what she thought was good, and she nailed it.  From cocktails to apps everything we tried was excellent. The butter me up, \ud83e\udd43  leather and tobacco bourbon cocktails, so good. Spicy shrimp and grits, Smokey green beans, Fried Chicken, deviled eggs, some kinda fried crawfish thing, everything was great.  The only thing that bummed me out a little bit was missing the Raccoon River Brewing Company.",
  "Nice lunch. Went in with a group of about 10 for lunch. We had a reservation so I was surprised that they hadn't put tables together prior to our arrival. They remedied that quickly though. Service was really good for a table of our size. Food all came out at once and I got several drink refills. I had the Southern Protein Bowl because I wanted something on the healthier side. Most of the delicious looking southern fare they serve doesn't really fit the bill. Although the protein bowl didn't not seem like an together cohesive dish, I appreciated the effort to give me something besides plain salad with chicken breast (which they also have if you are less adventurous and not willing to break the calorie bank). I will return when I'm in the mood to do live it up. The bread basket looked delicious."

  "Great service, great food, as always! LOVE Fong's pizza and the servers are always friendly and happy to help. Was delighted to hear I could try a can of cider and if I didn't like it I could order a different drink without being charged! I loved they would do this! (I really liked the Wilson's Orchard Cherry Crush cider so didn't need to change it, but would not have tried it without the reassurance I could change my mind! Food was served quickly and warm. Love their thin crust and delicious toppings! Can't beat Fong's, and even bought a second pizza to take home with us!",
  "Any visitor to Des Moines must try Fong's pizza. The crowd favorite is the crab rangoon--and it won't let you down. But don't overlook other options. I enjoy the Thai pizza as well. You will find many nontraditional options on the menu. And check out the specials which rotate with the seasons--particularly around the holidays. Pizza innovation and a fun atmosphere!",
  "I have always enjoyed Fong's Pizza. They have unusual combinations but they are well balanced and hit the spot.\n\nThe crust reminds you of good homemade style crust. It's not the generic dough that every other pizza joint seems to use. It's got good texture and it's just the right amount.\n\nThe toppings are fresh and quality. You're not getting a flavoured grease pizza, you are getting a pizza worth sitting down and sharing.\n\nThey have pizza by the slice and pizza by the pie. I recommend them to everyone.",
  "Delicious pizza! I absolutely loved the crust. The waitress forgot to get my friend's drink, but other than that, the service was good. The price is good also. I was pleasantly surprised at how cheap our bill was. I'll definitely go back!",
  "The service was great! The pizza was delicious.. Drinks were great. Definitely going to go back for more some day soon."

  "My husband and I had a great experience at R\u014dCA! We had arrived early for our reservation and sat at the bar, the bartenders were very attentive and took their time explaining the drink menu or food menu, my husband had the Smoking Gun and I had the Maxwell\u2019s Silver hammer, we soon were seated and try several shared plates, we tried the spicy green beans, Fondue, crab croquettes, ratatouille, and seared scallops. The flavors were so good! The only disappointment was there were only 2 scallops. For dessert had a Fig Manhattan martini. The server was very attentive and the chef even came out and checked on tables. Overall a great experience.",
  "We had an awesome small plate experience here. Our family has a soft spot for fondue. It was great. We had the Thai shrimp and it was incredible. The reconstructed nachos are super tasty, but over priced. If they were larger it would be fine, but it's really only enough for one of you're not sharing and two if you are. The caipiranhas were excellent.",
  "Wonderful pre-theatre spot. RoCA remains one of our favorite restaurants in Des Moines. The shared plates are delicious, especially the Asian Lettuce Wrap. Another favorite is the flatbread. Service is spot-on--friendly and attentive. Share small plates, or order a meal. If you're lucky, the dessert will involve a bubbly crisp a la mode. RoCA provides a friendly, comfortable dining experience with personalized service. A true gem!",
  "Loved it the cocktails were delicious and the food spot on. You get what you pay for forsure",
  "Great low-key place for cocktails and wine. My wife and I have been there a few times and have had great service each time. The wait staff offered excellent drink suggestions and the food was outstanding. Great place for a date night if you are looking for a place to have intimate conversations."

  "the french toast is life changing. best part of an all around amazing meal at a unique restaurant with great decor.\nother notable mentions: the cherry sundae, poutine, and hanger steak (not pictured)\nthe shellfish plate was perfect for our group of 7 - the lemony mussels were my absolute favorite! would definitely come back.",
  "The front desk staff were so polite. We got a seat at the bar and were welcomed by Shaun. He was one of the best bartenders I have ever encountered. Not only did he recommend his favorite app (calamari) but he made sure that we were taken care of. Everyone at the bar area deserves a raise. I even got a lesson on oysters. The young lady in the back answered all of our questions. I am so happy with our experience. Please come visit this restaurant.",
  "The service, the food, and the price were all great. Went with my sister, her husband, my niece, my nephew, my cousin, and my girlfriend. We all enjoyed the meal. When they brought out the appetizer, my girlfriend mentioned how she wished she picked a different side; the staff overheard and changed it for her. This spot is great for savory and sweet. I also liked the movie Django Unchained. Ha... if you\u2019re in Des Moines, go to Django!",
  "Very busy, very loud due to Tuesday all night happy hour but we were very well taken care of by Clint. Friendly, but not overly so. Effecient and professional.",
  "Sweet place. Great ambiance, great food and great service. A little pricey but you do get what you pay for. I liked the jazz music in the background too. Perfect place for a dinner date. Definitely recommend."

  "Came here for a date night and had an AMAZING experience. Felt that the dining area was congested - but forgot all about that as soon as we were seated. Our waiter made sure all of our questions were answered and suggested a few options based off other foods we enjoy. Highly recommend the parsnip bisque! Will definitely be coming back to try different dishes",
  "Came here for restaurant week and the food was SO good. I have come here and few times before and the prices are a splurge for my husband and I but well worth it. The food is always so good and presented in a lovely way. The atmosphere is quiet and lends well to a good conversation. The service was great as well with great attention to detail.",
  "Best place for fine dining in the area.   The chef's table is great to watch the kitchen and learn from the pro's.   Great wine and cocktail selection.   Wines are kept in a nitrogen dispenser so always fresh.  They are good at accommodating dietary restriction.",
  "Great food & we had amazing service! What a cool ceiling above the restaurant! Will definitely visit again on my next trip.",
  "The staff was extremely was extremely attentive and very accommodating. The dining experience was awesome. The presentation is very creative. The food was very hot when it was supposed to be. A little more expensive but worth it."

  "Had a really good experience, David was our server. He did a great job of explaining the menu and the specials. Ordered the veal chops which were cooked to perfection. Got the iceberg salad.  Also got the scalloped potatoes and Expresso cheesecake. We brought some bottles of wine for a $25 cork fee per bottle.  Decor in the restaurant was nice, they did have the cows and farm murals on the walls which I thought we cool but didn't really make sense in the setting.",
  "It was really good food. The Mac and cheese and for $1 more bacon. These were big chunks of bacon. My only complaint would be they are a little chalky from the flower but that's being but picky. The bone marrow appetizer was quite different and delicious. I liked it with the tomatoes as my wife liked it with the caper salad. The tomahawk steak was delicious. Cooked spot on. I would have preferred a little more salt and pepper seared on top. We were pretty shocked that the table next to us sent their steak back. The menu has what the temps mean. Underrated in all of this is the bread. The bread really was basically perfect. The service was amazing. The experience overall was a ton of fun. I wasn't a huge fan of the chocolate raspberry cake, but that's not the reason to go here. The cake itself was very good. I wasn't a fan of the raspberries (I love raspberries) and how the were in the middle.",
  "Wasn't very happy with the food. The service, ambiance and location are all amazing. The food? Who the heck is cooking this? It was mediocre at best. I've literally had better EVERYTHING, elsewhere. I was expecting one of the best meals I've ever had and it didn't even register in the top 10.\n\nOnce again, DSM suffers from lack of taste. I'm not sure who, in their right mind, is rating the food so highly here.",
  "Amazing food &. customer service. Michael was our waiter, and we couldn't have asked for better service. Great place to celebrate a special occasion.",
  "Amazing steaks. Interesting appetizers. Excellent servers and staff.\nJust know that this quality comes with a high cost. If you can afford it, it's fantastic."

  "This place is deceiving before you enter, the layout is amazing nice decor, nice place to have a decent meal or happy hour. I was not that hungry so I ordered the Asian lettuce wraps with Ginger chicken. It had a nice taste to it something different for the taste buds. The service was on point the decor was nice two levels. I would definitely recommend this place",
  "Americana used to be one of my favorite spots in Des Moines, for dinner and drinks and for brunch. I have done both recently, and I'm saddened to say that their quality has just gone downhill. The restaurant just has that cheaper restaurant feel now, instead of the upscale restaurant vibe it had before. And if you want to actually be able to eat & enjoy brunch food, don't go here, you'll spend the entire time waiting in line for the food.",
  "I've had dinner and drinks here but this was my first time experiencing the brunch buffet for 32$. Wow, what a good time. Grilled cheese bar, all the breakfast options, soups, tacos, deserts, bloody Mary bar and mimosas and many more. The quality of the food is good and better than most buffets for having so many options. I will be back and try to bring many people with me.",
  "Excellent service and food! My medallions were cooked to a perfect Medium Rare, and the mashed potatoes were to die for. I highly recommend!",
  "I really dig this place for many reasons. The food is great. The ambiance is very cool! The adult beverages are well mixed. And the prices are very fair. Definitely check out the brunch it is gigantic"

  "Fast service, even if there is a line. Glad to see this place has lasted years. Cool vibe and great food. I personally love the \"Walking Ched\" and the \"He's Coming to Get You Barbara\" burgers. Sure, they are probably not your healthiest options, but they sure are tasty!  My wife is a huge fan of their salads. The shakes are also tasty and they have a great selection of adult beverages. Highly recommend you try it!",
  "I went here when I was on a road trip. Zombie Burger was a great place with fantastic food.  It wasn't enough to call them an establishment, but they certainly had a laid-back vibe and we were not disappointed.  From the deserts to the burgers, the food was a great deal.  The cashier at the counter was very knowledgeable and served all of us very well.  It was nice having her take us for our drinks or for a quick snack before making the long walk home. -TBT  (This place is called Zombie Burger and they are a great burger place.)",
  "First time having it last night. I wish I could have made it before all the shut downs happened so I could see the fun decor lol... I absolutely loved the food! I am still full the next morning! Prices were better than I thought,  food was great! I would definitely recommend!!",
  "I mean, if you\u2019ve managed to scroll all the way to this review without knowing you should definitely be eating here, I don\u2019t know how my words will help! Delicious food in a fun atmosphere with quality service. Check their Facebook for all the amazing photos - you won\u2019t be disappointed!",
  "We went to eat at about noon. It wasn't that busy so food was quick. Burger and fries were hot and fresh. Good customer service and friendly staff!"

  "Two thumbs up to Buzzers Billy's!

Of course this year we could not go out to eat so they brought the south to us! Had great food but was lacking our favorite Hurricane drinks. Not allowed to have alcohol delivered via 3rd party service but when the manager Jeff heard about our anniversary tradition he delivered our favorite beverage himself! I was so happy I forgot to give him the tip I had in my hand for him! A big thanks to Jeff and Buzzard Billy's for making our anniversary dinner fabulously memorable once again! Can't wait to come in for more great food and drinks in the future! Thank you Jeff!",
  "I love this place and their Cajun food. I'm a big eater but it's a challenge to finish one of their dinners. Don't miss their Armadillo Eggs! Gotta have them every time I go. If I lived closer, I'd be there over and over again. Give them a try.",
  "Very fast and friendly service. They always handle large crowds very quickly and with ease. The food and menu is large and excellent. Great place to visit before an event at Wells Fargo Arena or anywhere else downtown. Can quickly accommodate large groups and plenty of seating available.",
  "Been here before and it's always good food. Alligator is tender and flavorful. The poutin was absolutely delicious! I was stuffed. The portions are great and so is the staff. Very friendly and inviting",
  "Place was comfortable, and people were cool. Only downfall was my gumbo, dont think they cooked the flower down enough. Other than that enjoyed ourselves"

  "I love the atmosphere of El Bait Shop and think everyone must experience. They have a large drink menu so you\u2019re sure to find something. \n\nI\u2019ve gone there multiple times with the intention of ordering food as well as drinking, but there usually is absolutely no seating. We went over to Miller High Life but it was an absolutely different vibe so we decided to leave. I don\u2019t know if it would be possible to designate an area for those dining as well, but something as such may help.",
  "Great Staff! First time here and had some questions on the menu and they were very knowledge about the menu. \n\nThey use local deli meats and it shows in the quality of the food! Everything we ordered was fresh and full of flavor!\n\nRestaurant decor was different but interesting and created a relaxed local bar feeling that was very inviting for everyone.",
  "Great atmosphere if you like bars with a laid back attitude and a ton of beer. You can't beat the beer selection. I've been to Des Moines twice and made sure to stop here each time. That being said, there is one bartender who always seems to have a chip on his shoulder. Other than that...the place is a gem.",
  "Friendly folks, cool atmosphere. Driving through Des Moines & stopped in for a whiskey and some grub but there are tons of good beers to choose from so had a couple with my meatloaf..... the food was excellent! Good job bait shop!",
  "Place is friggin awesome!!! Bartenders look out for their customers. Make sure they have a ride home after drinking. Appreciative of designated drivers. Mega fun atmosphere! Too many beers to even TRY in one day!!"

  "If you love German beers, you'll love the only German beer house in Des Moines, the Hessen Haus.  For some reason people really enjoying drinking their beer from the glass boot, but clearly the 1L giant mug is a better deal.  Food is the typical German fare with a few choices of sausages.  We're not a huge fan of the giant pretzels either, but it's definitely soft and soaks up plenty of beer.  Actually, we usually don't care that much about the food by the second liter of beer.  Parking has been slightly problematic recently due to the closing of the lot next to the restaurant, but with some patience, a street spot does open up eventually.  The service is really good, especially for large parties.",
  "Food was DELICIOUS!!!  When we first got there it was a few minutes before anyone even paid any attention to us. We had to sit at a dirty table and wait another few minutes before it was cleaned off.  After this.... it was definitely worth the wait. I will be going back!  (Hope service is better next time around)",
  "Great German restaurant. German cuisine is honestly not my favorite but the menu had something even for me and it was delicious! I had a very nice waitress and enjoyed the outdoor seating on a nice evening.",
  "Amazing! We lived in Germany for 7 years and this was the first German food we have had in the US that actually tasted German. We had a Jager schnitzel and salad and a giant beer. So yum! The spatzle was amazing too!  The atmosphere made us feel like we were back in Germany. We loved it!",
  "I celebrated my PhD today in this great restaurant. happy to tell that we passed a pleasant evening and the restaurant was unquestionably one of the reasons for that strong evening. The stuff  cooperated in a very nice style, the cuisine was very good and my guests were so  glad. We shall definitely visit again for more joyful events. Thank you very much."

  "Awesome restaurant and wedding venue. Amazing food in both parts. Whatever they are doing in the kitchen - they do it so right! Haven\u2019t had anything from here I didn\u2019t love, and all of the staff I\u2019ve met have been great. Absolutely recommend the taproom whether you are looking for a place to get married or just a place to grab a bite and a beer.",
  "Awesome selection of Iowa beers. Very cool place whether you are from here or elsewhere (like me). I want to take this idea back to my state. Love to support local beers. One of the best selections of all kinds of beer I\u2019ve run across.   Pretty lively for a week night as well. If I\u2019m ever back in Des Moines, I\u2019m headed here.",
  "Went here for dinner with another couple. Although they were very busy and we had a bit of a wait, we had no problem being quickly served at the bar (which was completely packed) while we waited for our table. Food was amazing. Service was great especially for how busy they were. Menu was pretty simple. Mostly burgers and salads. Entree's were to be expected of a bar and grill.",
  "The Iowa Taproom was a nice end to my VERY long day yesterday. The hubby and I split a self created flight and we all ordered something different so everyone could try everything. There wasn't one thing that we didn't like. The quality of the food, the taste and the value for the money was excellent. Our service was excellent and we all enjoyed the warm and calm atmosphere. It was a very enjoyable experience and I, personally, can't wait to go back again.",
  "We had a great time here! Beers were great, as was the service. The craft root beer they have on tap is delightful as well. We had a variety of appetizers and meals, all of which were very tasty and satisfying. We would definitely return!"

  "Picked up dinner for two and a bottle of wine for our anniversary. The food was still amazing by the time we got it home and out to eat and the service over the phone to pair wine was great. It made for a memorable and special anniversary dinner even though we couldn't dine at the restaurant while social distancing.",
  "Little bit of a wait on the food, but well worth it.  You can tell by the use of whole spices and the preparation that your getting scratch made. I took customers there and they enjoyed there meal.",
  "If you like food as art, then certainly go. What we had was tasty and interesting. Wasn't really a fan of the \"industrial chic\" decor. I'm not a big eater and don't care for hugh portions, but seriously, it was three spoonfuls if this, a single bite of that, and a few squirts of goo to decorate the plate. My husband walked across the street after a five course meal and got a sandwich at Jimmy John's.",
  "Great food, exceptional service, definitely a repeat. You get what you pay for. Love fancy menu",
  "Food & service are top notch! Drinks were amazing, service was amazing & food was beyond amazing! Highly recommend it! Chef Wilson is doing some amazing things check him out!"

  "I liked Latin King. It was more expensive than I thought it would be, with a upper/mid scale feeling. We visited late, but we're still given mostly good service. Ended up being the last table seated, with 5 people and felt forgotten when we were ready for the check.\nI will be back, but moreso for a date night rather than a family outing. I will come a little earlier also, so I'm not the last person out.\nI wasn't treated badly, but had a longer wait as the staff were closing up for the night- just to clarify",

I\u2019ve been to birthday celebrations, going away parties, graduation dinners, anniversaries, family outings, lunch, you name it.

  "I celebrated my PhD last night in this excellent restaurant. Well we had a superb evening and the restaurant was unquestionably one of the reasons for this outstanding gathering. The crew  contributed in a gorgeous manner, the cooking was great and my guests were so  pleased. We shall absolutely visit again for more events. Thank you very much.",
  "Friendly and fast service.  Lighting was a bit dark, but the food was good.  Not amazing, but good.  The service was phenomenal though and made the experience great!",
  "The best steak I've had in my entire life and trust me, I've eaten ALOT of steak! Cooked to a perfect medium rare for me and well done ( yes I know that's a crime ) for my husband. Amazing atmosphere, fabulous service from Jasmine and DELICIOUS food. Rather pricey but honestly worth it. Highly reccomend!",
  "So good!!! From service to food, awesome choice for eats. Intimate setting without being cramped. House dressing divine. Able to converse with dining companions because the music is tastefully light in the background.",
  "If you are looking for atmosphere.. you can find it here.  Cozy place and the service was excellent.  Good menu and grabbed a steak.    There are cheaper options, but again of you are looking for ambiance this is your huckleberry.  Will be back."

  "Visiting from Minneapolis and found this great stop for a trendy, fresh food type of lunch. The atmosphere was modern and chic. We had the salmon club and Turkey sandwich- both were incredible- fresh ingredients, rich flavors, and very filling. We might even grab food for the road tomorrow because it was so good. I would highly recommend!",
  "The Chef has created a menu beyond compare. The dishes have such full flavor and incredible ingredients that your palette will be satiated! The portions are perfect and the presentation is artistic. The atmosphere is beautiful, however, the clientele is young and fashionable and the temperature is a bit chilly. The food is so spectacular that I will return to try each item on the menu! Enjoy!",
  "First time here and I am very impressed! Food was amazing, service was amazing and coffee was great. My only complaint would be that I wish they had syrup for their coffee as I would have loved to get a vanilla latte! 10/10 will be back.",
  "This is the best place in town for a quick upscale breakfast with fresh ingredients and perfectly done eggs. I alternate between my favorites of Avocado Toast with poached eggs or the Everything Bagel Toast with poached eggs-so much flavor. Ambiance is upscale but not stuffy. Prices are over $10 for breakfast, but it is necessary for high quality ingredients and perfectly prepared food. Worth every dime!",
  "St. Kilda has some great eclectic dishes. We went for breakfast I had the breakfast tacos which were delicious. My husband had the \"cubano\" sandwich... we are from South Florida and he said that sandwich could compete with the Cuban sandwiches back home. Definitely, high praise from him... go try it and let us know what you think!"

  "Had the seafood Nacho's. I was puking all night and woke up with really bad stomach cramps. I'm sure that seafood was bad! Had to of been left out all day. My first time ordering will definitely be my last. I had heard amazing things about this place. They were not spot on.",
  "I\u2019ve gone here for dinner before and loved all of it. I tried their brunch and everything was amazing! From the service, to the drinks, to the food. Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive. I will definitely be back!",
  "So the drinks are pretty good here. And the bartenders are awesome, super attentive and friendly. \n\nI got the pork tacos and they were pretty good. Not the best I have ever had but the staff and ambiance made up for them. Again these tacos were good, just not the best I have had.",
  "Unique Midwest take on Mexican flavors. The flavors are all there but the remix of proportions makes the food special.\n\nVery friendly staff and nice ambience.",
  "I enjoyed the venue; very clean, cordial staff, and nice patio area where we sat. I would definitely make this a spot for taking my wife on a date night. However, I didn't agree with the prices. For 3 tacos, a sandwich, 3 salsa dips, and one drink it was just shy of $50. I understand trying to set yourself apart and make it upscale with a unique style/flavor/take but when it boils down to it other places are much cheaper for roughly the same quality in taste."

  "Finally made it to this local gem, and it lived up to the recommendations. I'm vegan and the selection was great, plenty of options, both ready to eat and frozen.\nYou can also pre order food, which I've heard is also really top notch food. \nStop by and try this place out if you haven't already.",
  "Absolutely fantastic place! Every single thing here is out of this world delicious.  The staff is very knowledgeable. I love this place so much. So happy to have it here in Des Moines\ud83d\udc9c",
  "I stumbled upon this Gem last fall and am a weekly patron. Brandy, John, and their team are passionate about their mission. Inventive, Real, wholesome and minimally processed food is at the heart of their weekly menu. I've tried many items from freezer and frozen cases. Chia pudding, stuffed pepper soup, chicken pot pie, tuna salad crunch, chickpea hummus, are just a few of my faves. The quality is superb and I love that they arent afraid to season the foods with spices and herbs. This is a Far better option to have healthy meals from a LOCAL small business than ordering the food boxes online. Highly recommend!",
  "I visited The Grateful Chef to grab something quick and healthy for lunch recently and was surprised by how unique and wonderful this place is. It seems like more of a location to grab larger, pre-made lunch and dinner meals - there is a giant selection of really creative, delicious sounding meals that need to be taken home and baked off. As for me and my needs, I was wanting something immediate and had a hard time between choosing the grab-n-go options... so I got the two that I wanted most: A fresh veggie and hummus sandwich and a smashed chickpea salad. The sandwich was very fresh, had unique flavors and texture, and was both light and balanced, and the smashed chickpea salad was also exciting with the flavor combinations and texture (red onion, dill pickles, turmeric, mustard). I don't have any allergies and haven't adopted any sort of diet (gluten-free, vegan, etc.), but these options both fell under those categories and I completely loved them both.\nI am new to Des Moines, and even more new to what the south side has to offer, so this was such a wonderful surprise. I will definitely be back and plan on telling more people about this place - especially friends and family that are looking for exciting vegan &/or gluten free options.",
  "The grateful chef was an amazing place so many organic made to order pre-made meals it was just absolutely a fantastic place to bedefinitely a top choice for any vegans out there that want a good quality meal for a very good price and the juice cleanse juices they have outstanding"

Every meal was quality and the waitress was great.  Easy to find and enjoyable atmosphere....just save up to pay for it.",
  "Absolutely wonderful! The food was delicious and not just the main course. The mashed potatoes were so tasty! Hopefully I have the chance to come back."

  "Wow. Our dinner and experience was delightful. From the knowledgeable servers who provided thorough descriptions of what we were eating ( including how to best consume) to the thoughtfully constructed, well-executed courses, we loved every course. The scallops were perfect and the short rib was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. At the risk of being overly fawning: service, drinks, appetizers, mains, desserts\u2014all A+. We\u2019ll be back. Soon.",

  "We showed up at around 11 a.m. on a Saturday when Farmer's Market was winding down. We wanted to get a bite to eat and something to drink. We got seated right away, and there was only a handful of other people sitting at the bar area and a couple of tables with customers sitting in their outdoor area. So they definitely weren't busy. Then it took about 15 minutes before the server arrived to take our order. 15 minutes later, glasses of water arrived for everyone. 10 minutes later beer arrived for everyone. So this is primarily a bar and from the time we walked in the door and were seated, it took 40 minutes for beer to arrive to our table at a time when they were definitely not busy. The food items to choose from at that time consisted of their breakfast menu. The Guinness potatoes and onions were quite undercooked. So the beer was just fine, but the food was not so great, and the service was pretty slow.  I really liked a lot of the decorations, and it did have a design aesthetic which is reminiscent of an English pub. But unfortunately the food and service were just not up to par.",
  "The actual bar/restaurant was closed due to Covid-19 but the outside was nice to check out. Great space for a drink or just a quick walk thru.",
  "Love this place right in downtown Des Moines cocktails and banger Bites.   Breakfast on the weekends is great.",
  "Just placed a takeout order for dinner. The Cornish Pasty was so good. The asparagus was perfect. I ordered an extra coleslaw - it was every bit as tasty. I coupled it with a Bellhaven Scottish Ale.",
  "Great British eats. Unique food not found anywhere else in town. The booze selection is awesome as well. I wish it was closer to my house. If it was I'd dine there 2-3 times a week. Great over all pub and grub."

  "I have refused to get take out during this pandemic, for obvious reasons. But tonight I decided since A DONG is the cleanest restaurant I have ever been to on a regular day, I would order from them. I walked in wearing a mask, they had baby wipes, disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer on the counter for customer use. The polite wonderful lady that rang up my order, wiped my debit card before handing it back to me. She gave me a complimentary ginger tea and an extra order of springs rolls on the house. They were clean, courteous and the food was delicious. Not only are they the best restaurant in town, but they are the ONLY restaurant for a pandemic. I was so impressed.",
  "We were not disappointed on our Sunday afternoon trip to A Dong.  Pleasant atmosphere, quick and competent waitstaff, and delicious flavors in every item we tasted.  Will gladly return to sample more from the sizable menu.",
  "The staff was attentive, and our order came fast. The food was better than anywhere I've eaten in town! I can't wait to go back.",
  "I've been coming here regularly for years and this is one of my favorite restaurants! There is a huge vegan selection and the food is always fresh and delicious. Great customer service and extra sanitation during this time!",
  "Consistently great! My sister recommended this place to me when I first moved to Iowa about 10 years ago. It has been one of my favorite places. Remember that this is Vietnamese food, not Chinese food. Some people go there expecting it to be something else. It is a very clean restaurant with super friendly staff. There is never a long wait for your food. Everything is done in a very timely manner. Same menu for lunch and dinner, with a lot of different options. Everything is fresh and comes in good size portions. Not expensive either.!"

  "This is one of my favorite places to eat. Ecuadorian food might be my new favorite!\n\nAlso, our server was very kind when we went a few weeks ago (when we could still eat in the restaurant). I love small restaurants like these. The food is delicious and the service is great. I highly recommend!",
  "It was my first time having this type of food and everyone at our table loved it. We got a wide range of items on the menu and our server went above and beyond making us feel comfortable and took his time explaining items on the menu as well as helping with suggestions. I will definitely go back when I am in the area again.",
  "This is one of my favorite restaurants. The prices are extremely reasonable, portion sizes are large, the staff is very helpful, and the food is delicious. I would highly recommend.",
  "My husband and I have been here a few times now and we have even brought our kids,  they are always very friendly and efficient!  They make sure they greet you and let you know they will be right with you even when extremely busy,  they get to you asap and you don't wait long to be seated and have drinks and order taken was only 3-5 mins and that was with a full house they literally only had 4-5 small tables remaining when we arrived and we arrived at the same time as another couple and they we're seated at the same time as us and order taken right after ours!  We always have a great experience,  and their plates are well worth the money!  The kids plates also come with a large amount of food!  You will not be disappointed by coming here!  I highly recommend it!!!",
  "Love the place! Try to get here once a month! I have never had a bad experience here. The food is great and the service is always exceptional. Everything from the salsa to the dessert is awesome!!"

  "Very diverse menu, interesting daily specials, very fair pricing. Highly recommend coming in multiple times without having a \"regular order\".",
  "Easily the best pretzel bites you'll find anywhere.  The cheese sauce is very obviously house made and I would consider trading state secrets for the recipe. (The server informs me that it's the same cheese sauce they use for their mac & cheese.)\n\nThe chicken pesto bowl has a rather more subtle and smokier pesto, which works to the benefit of the dish. Many pesto recipes over-salt the sauce, which would overshadow the mushroom and fresh tomato flavors. Definitely a solid choice for the salt-conscious as well as those looking for a meal not dominated by one flavor."

Beautifully balanced space and menu.The beet salad was perfect in every way, acid,beautiful greens,good to the  nose and palate and a small portion.

  "Their breakfast menu is crazy good!! I also love that they have chorizo. Nothing on the menu is bland or boring but completely the opposite. This is the place I'll bring my guests that are from out of town to, it's never fails. Also love that they're right on a bike path. Can get real busy but the turnover is fast. Definitely recommend Mullets.",
  "It was very good.  We started with ribs and burnt ends (meal) with sweet potato tots and onion rings, but shared it as an appetizer.    I ordered the breakfast nachos and they were awesome, but I was already stuffed.  Can't wait to go back!",
  "We live is West Des Moines where it is FULL of good places to eat, yet we will DEFINITELY drive downtown just to get to eat here. Food and drinks are AMAZING and the prices are VERY affordable! If it wasn't for the fact that it is almost ALWAYS packed of people (with good reasons) we would come here more often. The service is also great! Servers are VERY friendly and the service is fast as well! FULLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!",
  "Everything was amazing. The ribs were smoked perfectly. The Mac and Cheese was cheesy and a little sour. Loved it. The broccoli was burnt just slightly. The cob salad was huge. You got to try the sweet potato fries and the marshmallow dip stunned everyone at the table.",
  "Nice place with lots of choices. Friendly fun staff. Yummy food and very cold beer.  was clean, little on the small side. They do have a patio, looks over the river. They serve breakfast and have Sunday Brunch."

  "Phenomenal, went for Valentine's dinner and the food was delicious and the proportions were pleasntly more than I expected for fine dining. Needles to say my girlfriend was very impressed.",
  "I ordered a fresh salad. It was so good I practically inhaled it. Had the chef's special, or part of it at least, because it was so good everyone had to sample it.  They also make ice cream there, and we happily had some of both flavors for dessert. It was just the perfect meal.",
  "It was so good I didn't get photos. The food is delicious but you're going to pay for it, but it's so worth it. It's very much a special occasion place and you'll enjoy every minute of a the candle lit, nice old house vibe.\n\nWe started with the polenta cakes which were simple but incredible. They were a perfect, light starter. Then I followed up with gnocchi (literally the best in Des Moines) and my boyfriend got the New York Strip. Both were delicious and came with great sauces and were perfectly portioned. We left stuffed, choosing to drink our dessert downtown.\n\nMy recommendation is to make a reservation. It's a small place that can fill up quick. Also pick a meal and wine pairing the wait staff recommends because there are lots of things you can't get anywhere else. They know what's best so you better trust them \ud83d\ude09.",
  "My wife and I loved it! Great atmosphere, servers and guests are all so positive. It feels like the perfect place to go for an intimate dinner with your loved one. Food was delicious. Highly recommend the gnocchi!",
  "The absolute best! Simple food done right. Delicious!  \nThere is no parking on site. So streetside parking could be a challenge at certain times."

  "Amazing dinner experience at The Angry Goldfish. We had an awesome waitress who was also working as a bartender! We didn\u2019t catch her name, but she was wearing a maroon Exile t-shirt! Our drinks, apps and food came out so quickly and everything was hot and AMAZING! We ordered the Sriracha goldfish and the pretzels and beer cheese for appetizers. (Beer cheese and pretzels were OUTSTANDING!) Then, we ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese and a side of mac and cheese and the meatloaf meal. Both were amazing and we would eat again! Then, I paid and accidentally left my card. The waitress came running out to our car to give it back to us!",
  "This place has a clean and cozy atmosphere! The food.... the food is PHENOMENAL. All homemade food. Small menu, which for me is perfect, with tasty choices! Their AG burger is definitely a go-to. It has a zesty sauce on it that's to die for!\nTheir signature spicy goldfish crackers are really good and honestly, I grab some to go, too! \nThis place is perfect for our date nights!",
  "Small neighborhood atmosphere with home cooked food and a relaxing environment. Whether your in work clothes or dressed up you should feel comfortable. Wait staff is amazing. Worth checking out!",
  "The place is pretty chill and the interior looks cool. Especially like the bathroom sign, it gave me a good laugh. Had a small poutine with my wife which tasted very good, nice strips of steak and delightfully savory. My wife had a Goldfish Mule which according to her was on point and one of the best that she ever had. We both tried the fish and chips which I very much liked. My wife was excited that they made not only all of their entrees fresh but the sauces were homemade too. Great atmosphere and the staff was friendly, be happy to come back again.",
  "What an amazing place! We stopped in on a Saturday around 12:30 to a crowded house. The only seats available for two of us were at the bar. We were greeted with friendly faces and INCREDIBLE customer service. Monty was our server, but the other bartenders chipped in for drink refills, etc. \nWe started out with fried pickles, then I ordered the warm bacon salad (minus the feta) and my son ordered the Sriracha tenderloin and fries. We split the fries with a side of brown gravy. Everything was absolutely superb. It was fresh and hot out of the kitchen, and even after finishing our meals, the remaining fries were cooler, but still delicious. The dipping sauce for the pickles was spicy and I assume has Sriracha, as was the tenderloin, obviously, but not so hot that it was overwhelming. There were just great mixes of flavors.\nThis was my first visit, but I will be back. It was so FANTASTIC!!"

  "This is an authentic flavorful hot spot. Line out the door for lunch. I had the vegan burger (house made)  that is delicious. The Lentil soup was spices perfectly. And the butter in the baklava I swear came from a blessed cow. Well done. I am in awe of the level of mastery coming out of this kitchen.",
  "We were looking for a lunch get away from Lutheran hospital. Searching nearby restaurants, we found this little gem. Friendly staff, really good food, and fast service. We enjoyed the lentil soup and gyros-very tasty and not greasy whatsoever!\nThere is a well stocked bar. This place is located a couple of doors down from old Varsity theatre. Vegan options.",
  "Love the veggie/vegan options and the coffee!  The pistachio baklava is outstanding.  I don't eat beef, so can't comment on that.  The chicken dishes and stuffed grape leaves are amazing.  A must for Mediterranean food  lovers!",
  "Just had amazing lunch here. Excellent chicken wrap, meat was soft and juicy, Pita soft and fresh. Also had a side soup and a hot tea. Best $12 I\u2019ve spent in a long time. Owners are so kind and hands on, run the counter themselves.  Plenty of seating. Can\u2019t wait to eat here again. Thank you for an excellent meal."

  "This place always delivers on taste.  The service is quick and place is clean.  My two favorite rolls are the o snap and rising sun.  They are a must try!",
  "AMAZING service. Great prices. Excellent food. Our waiter made great recommendations and even threw out a surprise non-menu item. Great experience.",
  "Have visited this restaurant several times. There sushi is good, but wouldn't be a raving fan by any means. There staff always seems to be slightly behind the ball too which for what you are paying you would expect more. For example, we had to wait like 10 minutes to get small plates as they were all out of them and waiting for them to come out of the washer... There Saki bombs are less than desirable on presentation too.",
  "I really like this place. I do wish that they had more vegetarian options though since I am vegetarian. But the veggie tempura and the fried tofu with the Mayo sauce are pretty filling. Their presentation is really good as well and the servers are friendly. Definitely recommend \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c"

  "Very nice homely Italian food. Everyone was friendly and the cheesy garlic bread was on point. Chicken dishes were tasty and cooked perfectly. Only thing to mention is the lack of vegetarian options. The mariana sauce is cooked in meat so out of luck if your not a Alfredo person. Didn't try dessert but was probably legit.",
  "Best Italian food in the metro. Service is amazing and the food is yummy!",
  "Ordered their chicken saltimbocca and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! No joke, their food is the BEST in the city, hands down. Great atmosphere, amazing food, large wine selection with full bar and the service in on point. I need more stars!",
  "Generous portions, good food. Will be back again. I had the Penne Salsicca entre with garlic cheese bread for an app.",
  "They offer a great range of delicious food. I enjoyed dining here. The employees are always helpful, prices are affordable and the place is always neat."

  "Pleasant comfortable setting with good service but food was just ok. Our group tried different lunch dishes and all agreed there was nothing special. My ice tea tasted old. Grilled cheese with hummus side looked very good but all tasted a little sweet. Even the generous serving of thin pita chips with the hummus had a sweet taste. I like savory salty and dessert sweet.\nI think we will continue frequenting Cheese Bar when in the neighborhood.",
  "Great atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, and perfectly prepared food. Excellent cocktails to boot! We tried three dishes and six cocktails, plus two desserts. We were too full for a third! Excellent experience from start to finish, every visit has been consistently enjoyable.",
  "We love Eatery A! Their pizza is phenomenal but definitely on the pricey side. Their happy hour for half-off pizzas and bottles of wine is from 3-6pm every day (including weekends!!). If we have a group of four or so, we all get our own pizza and trade pieces to try everything and split a couple bottles of wine.\n\nThis place can't be beat for happy hour deals!\n\nFour stars because they nickle and dime for little things like asking for olive oil on the side to dip crust in.",
  "This place was very neat. I went for brunch, and it was a bit of a slow say given the ongoing viral epidemic, but the food was excellent, the decor was tasteful, and the staff was attentive and kind. I hear this place also has a supreme happy hour, but I wouldn't know anything about it. I do recommend!",
  "Worst dining experience. I always heard great things about Eatery A and was excited to try them out, especially after seeing they had a gluten free crust and dairy free cheese for their famous pizzas. While ordering I\u2019m informed they are out of vegan cheese, not a big deal, but then find out their gluten free crust has dairy. So the waitress says you can either get the normal gluten crust without dairy or the gluten free with dairy. Neither of which I can have. Unfortunately, the rest of their menu is very limited for allergy sensitive people. I ended up a steak which was very undercooked and dangerous for me, which I didn\u2019t realize at first since it was so dark in there. I was only able to barely eat half of my meal. Additionally, we brought out of town guests and after they ordered the waitress came back to inform us they were almost out of what one of them ordered so they could only do a half order (apparently they were out of everything that night). At the end of the meal the waitress tried to make our guests feel better by saying she only charged us for a half of the order instead of the full. Really? So they charged us for what they served us? Not sure how that makes it better. Lastly, the bar tender chugging beer and dropping f-bombs just added the cherry on top. If you have food sensitivities or allergies don\u2019t go here. A very expensive bill for a very disappointing meal."

  "Last night was our first time eating at Harbinger. The setting is intimate with candles on the table, and minimal but rustic decor. The servers are very attentive, always making sure you have water. \n\nThe food is delicious and small plate style. Follow the directions of the server and order a starter or two followed by one to two dishes per person and you'll leave feeling satisfied.\n\nEverything is very vegetable forward but that's what I enjoyed the most. Elevating vegetables in the bleak landscape that is not only American, but Midwestern dining is a feat. \n\nWe'll definitely be back at some point.",
  "Our first time visiting Harbinger and we enjoyed it. Smaller, intimate space. Focus on quality- NOT quantity so be prepared for that. Staff 5 stars! Everyone kind, welcoming, helpful, etc. Really felt like they wanted us there. We didn't have reservations so just sat at the bar. Fun watching all the drinks being prepared. I had the butternut squash which was an absolute delight. BF had peking duck which was good- we both liked mine better. $60 for 3 drinks and 2 meals. The taste and quality were so wonderful- portion sizes quite small.  Anyway- fun last minute decision and good time. Glad we tried it!",
  "Harbinger is an interesting place. I would definitely go once in a while for an experiential meal. My favorite aspect of the experience was the presentation of each dish and for a few of them I thought the flavours were really well orchestrated. The ambiance was not on par with the sophistication of the food. I would eat here again to see how things have progressed.",
  "Phenomenal place. Easily the best food I've had in the area, and I appreciate the focus on vegetables/vegetarian dishes plus their efforts to highlight things you won't find at most other restaurants. Great service, and it's fairly reasonably priced if you take advantage of the happy hour deals!",
  "Harbinger is one of the most delightful places to eat in Des Moines. Chef Joe Tripp is an absolute wizard with vegetables and they are the stars of his dishes. When meat is ordered he pairs it beautifully for a delicious explosion with every bite."

  "I've been coming here on a regular basis since they opened up a few years back. The menu has evolved over time, but the food has stayed consistently great. If you're looking for a great breakfast or lunch spot, you've found it. It really is some of the best food in town. My only knock on the place is that they aren't open on the weekends.",
  "Great food. Best burgers. Not even a close second. The burgers are so fresh. I don't usually have food cravings but when it comes to these burgers I need a fix about every 2-3 weeks.",
  "Good food. Parking is rough. Went to pick up some food while my wife was in the hospital after having a baby. No where to park so had to park in the garage, but they didn't validate so had to pay $6 to stop and pick up food. Probably won't be heading back.",
  "Best spicy chicken sandwich in town. Almost makes me not want to post a review to keep the line down. Friendly staff that always remain professional even during peak hours. Chorizo fries and fresh lemonade are my new favorite combination.",
  "Everything was farm-to-market fresh at a fast food price! The spicy chicken sandwich is ten times better than Chick fil A IMHO!"

  "Wanting a change of pace from pork dishes (no offense, Iowa!), my husband and I came here to check out the seafood options to plan a nice dinner at home. The variety of options were amazing and the prices were very reasonable on nearly everything that caught our eye. I had intentions on picking up some scallops because I have a weak spot in my heart (and belly) for that, but after looking around more, we ended up choosing some large swordfish fillets. When we made dinner later, we didn't have to do anything elaborate to the swordfish in preparation - the flavor and texture was hearty and wonderful. I have heard fantastic things from numerous people who have eaten here, and will absolutely be back in the future to dine - but the market portion itself is worth checking out!",
  "I'm no seafood connoisseur but I love their tartar sauce! Great service too, Jenny? even offered to get our drinks to go, which is a nice touch.",
  "pros: service was good and the lobster was pretty good. Location in Ankeny was easy to get to. \nCons: for being a seafood place I expected decent sea food. When shrimp is over cooked and the scallops are just okay, it\u2019s pretty disappointing since that should be something your really good at when your a seafood place. With the high rating I expected more. The atmosphere was okay but I thought it would be a little nicer given the price of food. I will likely not go back unless I try the other location as I have heard that one is much different/ better.",
  "A pretty darn good place to eat. Fresh seafood daily and fixed and presented beautifully.  I had Wild Gulf Shrimp, grilled. Delicious. Salmon looked beautiful..great pasta dishes too. You won't be sorry. Go early or you might have a wait.",
  "Awesome food & the staff was great\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f"

  "This little gem is tucked away in the corner of the market. Best pho I've had in the city. Get the crab rangoon as it's got the real thing in it. The seafood pho is the show stopper! Delicious and authentic",
  "Very busy place and for good reasons. Food is phenomenal. prices are great. I always leave with left overs",
  "Good portion of large Pho that won't break the bank.\n\nFlavors of the Pho leans toward the sweeter side with sprinkle hints of star anise and cinnamon. The soup is clean and has an alright depth.\n\nAfter finishing, it gets your mouth to the \"I need some water\" state.\n\nNice service and busy sometimes for seating.\n\nFor being tucked away in a Super Market, it is not a bad Pho.",
  "This is one of the only places I go for Pho, and I've been to many across the Des Moines metro. It is by far the best. The service is always fast and friendly and it's always a reasonable price. Plus, I love that it is inside of an Asian grocery. Always fun to walk around and shop on a full stomach. :)",
  "AWESOME PHO!!!! Best in Des Moines for sure! They have great Boba too and a selection of other awesome vietnamese dishes. It is in the front corner of the Asian grocery store."

  "Just got the simple gyro. Easily the most delicious gyro I've had in the area. The meat was tender and seasoned well, the tomato was extremely fresh, and the pita was extremely soft. The fries, on the other hand, were a little bland so I would recommend trying the Greek fries instead. Food came out very quickly and the staff was absolutely fantastic. I highly recommend visiting Olympic Flame!",
  "Awesome little place in the the East Village. Authentic food, excellent service and some nice Greek wines! Highly recommend!",
  "Quaint small space. Delicious authentic Greek food, wine, and beer. Incredible service every time."

  "Wonderful experience with Christopher's for my wedding rehearsal dinner. My mother in law did a beautiful job planning and Christophers carried it out perfectly. Service was great, food was excellent. Thank you!",
  "Toasted ravioli is really good and it\u2019s only $10. Fried chicken and manicotti is a little bit pricey. Things are too salty. Soups are really good.",
  "The service is always great. It's a family owned restaurant,  they remember you. Food is awesome.",
  "Christopher\u2019s has been around for years and I have eaten there many times over the last 20+ years. Though I had not been there for some time. Recently I had family in town that wanted to go there since they to had not been for years. We were greeted by friendly staff and made sure we had what we needed. The food did not disappoint, it was as good as it had always been. I did miss the dinner rolls they used to serve, the were great. Otherwise all was great!",
  "Service was spectacular. Food was amazing. Drinks were strong. Great experience. I will return!"

  "This pic is the Lucca salad. I typically order the primavera (with chicken); the noodles are amazing- cooked perfectly, the cream sauce and veggies are so fresh and their service is above and beyond, always. Ordered dinner to go once and they made the primavera (even though it's generally just on the lunch menu) and they threw in a slice of dessert to enjoy. This is easily one of my favorite restaurants.",
  "This is a good find in Ames.  We were looking for dinner after a flight.  Came across this place on Goggle map with 4.7 rating.\n\nIt is a nifty setup in an elongated room.  The decor is pretty minimal yet comfortable.\n\nThe packaged menu has quite a few combo.  I started with just a standard Caesar salad.  Then followed by sausage risotto.  My big dish was scallops.  After that, a dessert tray!\n\nAll good stuff...",
  "I had only eaten lunch here before, and it was always solid. When I finally had their little four course dinner, I was pleased as punch. I had one of the best pieces of salmon I've had in my life. Portions were pretty spot on. The pasta was excellent. Service was prompt. Limited bar was all we needed.  10/10 would go back.",
  "Cozy spot for yummy Italian. Menu is prix fixe, and each course has a well-rounded list to choose from. Service is very good, understated but attentive.",
  "Jen and I had new year's eve dinner at Lucca and had a great time. The food was superb, wine selections reasonably, and wait staff impeccable. Loved it! We'll be back!"

  "We just finished pickup....obviously Wild West Mexican prefers to keep our business during these difficult times and more  importantly they want our business when times are better. KUDOS to the Staff. OUR FOOD WAS GREAT!  Wanting our business after Covid-19 is not necessarily every restaurant 's  mission",
  "Always great food. Staff is always super nice. The place is always busy, so you know it's good. Food is fast but not TOO fast, even when they are busy. Highly recommend!",
  "Great lunch spot. This was my first time here and I enjoyed it. Service was super fast and friendly, food was delicious, atmosphere is great, and lunch pricing is spot on.",
  "This is the best restaurant. They have excellent service and it is so fast, no matter what time of day or what you order, your drinks stay full and your food comes out hot. The food is yummy. My favorite appetizer is the Mexican guacamole. I also like that the tables aren't on top of each other. I'm a big woman and I can move around easily in the restaurant. Great place for a work lunch because of the speed!"

  "Absolutely wonderful. Our waitress Angel was top notch, answered all our questions. It might take a bit to get your food but that's because it's cooked up fresh. I definitely suggest this place if you want good cajun food.",
  "Wonderful little hole in the wall type place!\nWas nearby with a friend who recommended it and went to check it out. Food was amazing, everything from appetizers to entrees and sides.\nWe each had a Po'boy sandwich (blackened Shrimp for me and fried alligator for her) and the Cajun Bacon Mac & Cheese as our side.\nLeft completely full and even had leftovers to take home!",
  "I love the place.  Great food.  I like to order the smothered catfish over jambalaya with a side of the jalapeno cornbread. Not really on the menu but perfect.  I  HIGHLY recommend this place.",
  "It has to be a 5 star because you got it or not when you shrink a live music Cajun restaurant and wholesome food. Felt crowded at first then very comfortable. Real different atmosphere will definitely come back great experience.",
  "We tried this place a few years ago and was very disappointed in the food. We decided to try it again, and OMG, what a difference. We ordered 3 types of sampler platters. Everything was delicious. Especially the frog legs!"

  "Always great food. Old school Italian still run by the family. From pasta to chicken wings (one of the few places that still sell the ENTIRE wing) to pizza to lobster to great desserts, Noah\u2019s is still the one. We do mainly carry out, but try having a seat at the sunken bar. Great drinks & extensive wine list. Friendly service from managers, host & servers.",
  "I was referred to Noah's Ark by the concierge at my hotel downtown in Des Moines. I'm so glad I went there! I arrived at opening during lunch. The menu is so big, so much to choose from! I ended up getting the Chicken Parmesan lunch special, I think it was 12.95. A great deal. First they brought out one of their famous garlicky love knots. Then I had a house salad with their famous creamy Italian dressing. It was a generous serving of salad, and it was good. The dressing was to die for! I don't usually like creamy Italian, but the waitress told me how good it was. She was right! It was amazing! I'll have to buy some next time I'm there. The Chicken Parmesan was delicious. It came with spaghetti and a very big Dinner Roll! That roll was like two rolls. The chicken parmesan had a little bit of bell pepper and onion in it, which I loved! After my meal I was too full for dessert. But the waitress gave me a complimentary bite of some delicious cheesecake! That was very nice of them to do that. A good way to get me to buy a big piece next time I'm there!",
  "I admire this place! They offer tasty dishes, they have a nice menu, The chef in that restaurant is a specialist, I love a lot trying all their food. The food is always fresh and tasty, the attitude towards the customers  is very good too. I often go to  this place and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it with no hesitation.",
  "Based on the reviews I expected delicious food and good service. However, the best part was our server.  It was surprising that their vegetable side dishes were seemingly from a can and very overcooked.  The fruit salad - also from a can.  Their baked potato must be very popular as they had run out of them by 5pm.  The Spaghetti side was overcooked, very mushy and not drained that left a pool of water on the plate and which diluted the delicious sauce.  The Prime Rib was very undercooked for Medium Rare and was sinuous.  There was an old and limp piece of lettuce on the plate as decoration that is unnecessary and a waste.  One of the highlights was the Garlic Knot rolls provided prior to the meal.",
  "I go to this excellent restaurant often  as I enjoy the good mood that is part of this place. The crew is highly loyal and skilfull. The service is certainly fast. Needless to say, the food they cook is magnificent. I have been there more than once and I was always delighted. The pay is decent. I recommend this place to to all."

  "As soon as you walk in you know somehow you are going to have some great Italian food. Very unique location basically in the middle of a neighborhood. The bread that you start off with is fantastic. Soup or salad options are great. The server was always prompt with delivering our orders and the wine options were very reasonable. The pastas were so good! Can't go wrong with any of them. The dessert tray that they bring at the end looks so good I wish I could order every cake they have! The carrot cake was amazing though. And when we got our check at the end we were shocked at how affordable everything was. You'll love this place!",
  "Delicious food. There was a party of 10+ seated beside us that were celebrating a birthday and insanely loud, and while there were other dining rooms, this was the one my parry of 2 was seated in. I wish they had started using other rooms to accommodate because I couldn't hear myself think for the entire meal. Certainly not our server's fault though.",
  "The service was very good very friendly courteous helpful.\nThe appetizers were very good. Add steak and shrimp for supper excellent. Had a slice of red velvet cake for dessert most excellent.\nI would have no hesitation to recommend this restaurant to anyone. Pleasant and friendly atmosphere.",
  "Go here as often as I can.  The food is always incredible.  The service and ambience of the entire experience is what you expect in an old school Italian home.  I hope they are always going to be there to welcome us and feed us.",
  "The bar area is nice and the soup and bread was good, but they seated us in a drab area upstairs. Dipping oil wasn\u2019t offered but is available upon request (I spotted another table with some) Eggplant was greasy and not good. Service was great. Prices are way to high for this quality. They did remove the charge for my meal which was very nice of them."

  "This place is my preferable place.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. everytime  I I need a good lunch, this is the place that comes first to my head. extremely good and all sorts of  food and a large list of dishes.trained staff, and good spirit. In addition to that, the price is affordable. I sent my friends to this spot with great pleasure.",
  "The last time I visited Maxie's they were still at the original location on Ingersoll. That must have been the early 1970s. Decided to try them out tonight. now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. We pretty much had the place to ourselves probably because of the weather.\nOrdered the combination breaded veggies ; onion rings, breaded mushrooms, fried pickles & fried green beans. All were hot, crisp and perfectly seasoned.\nDinner was a Rarebit burger and the white cheddar bacon jam Burger. Both burgers were prepared exactly as ordered. all of that plus a couple of glasses of half priced house wine and expert service made for a surprisingly awesome evening. Maxie's will definitely be a place we will visit often from now on.",
  "My wife and I stopped in for lunch today. Comfort food from days gone by still being served up and the service was spot on.\n My wife mentioned we had never been here before but always wanted to stop. Our waitress and the other waitress both welcomed us . Hearing welcome to the family from the two of them really made our day.\n Thanks for great food and an amazing staff of employees .We will be back often. \n\nMike and Julie Davis",
  "It's a fair price for the food. Which is good but it's like dinner kinda food so it's what it is. But the staff is excellent and always happy and helpful.",
  "I can't remember the last time I rated a restaurant so low.... no greeting when we came in, 3 employees went past us and no one greeted or offered to seat us. Finally someone sat us after more people came in behind us.  The waitress was fine at first, got our drinks and appetizer, but then she got a table of 8. She took their drink orders and got all of their drinks, then got their appetizer orders and served those, then went to get their dinner order. Never once between all of that did she check on us, bring out our meals, refill our empty drinks that were on the edge of the table.\n\nSomeone else brought our food out around the time she was starting their appetizer orders and the fries and onion rings were cold so it had obviously been sitting in the back for awhile.  I also didn't get the salad with house dressing that I'd asked for.  \n\nWhen I saw her taking the dinner orders at the other table, I sighed and said something to my son and then someone else that was walking by  finally over - I think he heard me.  I asked him for refills on our cups and told him the sides were cold and that I just wasn't hungry anymore.  I did NOT ask for a discount, I just wanted something to drink and to leave.\n\nNeither of us finished our meals and for the first time that I can remember we left the food and didnt even bring it home for left overs or to feed to our chickens.... \n\nThe appetizer was good, my ton said he liked the baked potato.  Cold fries and onion rings on my plate - well those are never good cold.  My meal was, egh.  \n\nThe guy that refilled our water asked if we wanted the check, I said yes and I have no idea why he asked if I wanted two checks when I was having dinner with my 13 year old son.  That was odd.  He made a point of telling me that he took the appetizer off the bill (since my dinner was cold??)  I said that wasn't necessary, paid and left.\n\nI wouldn't go back.  I saw other great reviews but to have a waitress completely ignore us for that long, cold food, leaving a salad off... Simply not worth my money."

  "Wow! Wonderful selection of mouth-watering menu items fit for every taste.  I feared for a long wait in the Sunday lunch rush but our food came out fast and delicious!  Pick up your groceries on the way out!",
  "The cafe has an extraordinary, organic menu with a comfortable setting. Gateway Market Cafe is adjacent to the unique Gateway Market which sells wine, cheese, flowers, groceries, and locally sourced gifts.\nFrom the street Gateway appears to be just the market. The Cafe makes it definitely worth the visit!",
  "Love this place. It's close to the interstate which for a traveler like me is great. Could use more parking, always good and reasonably priced food, and when I have time I shop. I've had food delivered from here having all the places in the city to choose from. It's Cafe style, it works!",
  "Good food. Great options for a quick dinner or going to the grocery store for different items that you won't find at places like Hy vee or Wal Mart. Good location.",
  "The food is excellent. Process are good also. I had the steak tacos and they were very taste. Along with me a friend had the pad Thai and loves it and the other friends had a salad and loved it and the dressing. I would highly recommend."

  "Absolutely amazing place. The staff were extremely welcoming and thankfully weren't hover waiters. The food was delicious and you get a lot of bang for your buck. The atmosphere is also amazing containing many Japanese products from a large traditional kimono they have hang on a wall along a Noh mask, to the little knickknack here and there placed thought the store. Gives you a real feeling of visiting somewhere in Japan from the middle of Iowa",
  "Always a class act! Professional sushi at good prices in a friendly atmosphere. Always my favorite place in Des Moines to get sushi. Took our 10 year old and he loved every bite.",
  "Every time I come here I am served promptly and with kindness. Cozy hole-in-the-wall feels, with a warm, classy ambiance. The owner is extremely kind and accommodating - as well as the servers. Not to mention the sushi is well crafted, fresh, and always hits the spot. 10/10 would recommend. \ud83d\ude07",
  "My wife and I went on a dinner date to miyabi 9 and had a wonderful time. we were well taken care of in all aspects of our service with some complimentary service being that it was our first time and we were blown away at the quality and craftsmanship that they put into their sushi as well as their desserts. The restaurant itself is quaint and very cozy and clean. we ate at the bar which we don't typically do but really enjoyed it watching and communicating with the chefs.  We will most certainly be heading back there in the near future because we left so satisfied. We would highly recommend Miyabi 9 for sushi over the many other options in the metro area.",
  "I was leaving my friend\u2019s birthday sleepover and realized I had locked my keys in my Jeep. While waiting for roadside assistance, I ventured down the street to find something to eat. Alas, I find myself in front of Miyabi 9. I sat at the bar, having the ability to watch the sushi being prepared. The owner was working, busily creating wonderful works of art as I watched in absolute awe. He personally took my order of smoked salmon and yellowtail tuna. Absolutely melt in my mouth, fresh seafood. It was utopian bliss for my palate. I also ordered a serving of the mini spring rolls, apparently looking so incredibly appetizing, the woman sitting next to me placed an order of her own! I will definitely return!\u2014I believe locking my keys in the car was fate. \ud83c\udf63 I\u2019d give Miyabi 9 five THOUSAND stars if I could!"

  "My family and I decided to try something new and chose Chucks! We came in last Saturday, while the restaurant was quite busy we were offered the choice of the music room - the room was fairly busy but we were seated immediately. Our server Kelsey greeted us right away with waters and assured us wait times may take a little longer. We weren\u2019t sure what to order, she recommended several of her favorites, we chose mozzarella sticks and wings to get started. They were  DELICIOUS. Great portions. Kelsey continued following up with us, refilling our drinks & making sure we were happy, she had a great attitude, kept smiling (which is a big deal to have a continuous smile and bubbly personality to me). She was very busy, having several other tables and rooms. We ended the night with a chicken fettuccine, a spinach ravioli, and a large buffalo chicken pizza. All was worth the wait! Very great tasting food, good pricing and great people!! Will be back soon!",
  "I've always driven past this place but never thought I'd ever go in. My boyfriend and I decided to try something new, and since this was right down the street from us, we ended up choosing this place. Best. Food. Ever! I ordered the Bruschetta Burger and was so impressed. My boyfriend ordered wings and spinach ravioli in alfredo sauce. Alfredo sauce is always a hit or miss with me but when I tried some of it from his plate... amazing! These people are so friendly and definitely know how to make food.",
  "We met friends for pizza at Chuck's recently and thoroughly enjoyed it! Great pizza and onion rings, tremendous service and perfectly mixed cocktails. The place isn't fancy, but is reminiscent of a classic 1960s neighborhood restaurant. We had the \"Everything\" pizza and it was superb! Last Friday my friend and I made a late evening trip to Chucks for pizza. It was delicious! We had some onion rings as an appetizer. They were thin and crispy and so tasty! Our waiter was right on top of things. I highly recommend this restaurant!!",
  "Great food and service. Very good portion size. I\u2019ll Definitly return.",
  "This spot is worth giving a shot. They have large portions for reasonable rates. Constantly clean and with excellent vibes. Will visit here again."

  "Ginnchiest place in Iowa!! How can you NOT love this place?? Great Beer and Food. Super cool place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon... I will visit again!!",
  "Food was absolutely delicious!  Perfectly prepared!  My tenderloin was crisp, but tender, not overbreaded or overcooked!  Fries were perfect, not burnt. Loved my meal, and Bloody Mary drink was outstanding, beautiful to see and refreshing to drink. Also, great place for a conversation.",
  "I don't know how they managed to make this relatively new bar feel so perfectly divey. The food, the music, everything was on point. Great comfy bar to hang out and drink in for a while. The chicken was salty, crispy and delicious.",
  "What a great dive with good service and good food. Worth a visit. Try the fried cheese curds and the Lil Smokies.",
  "The bacon-wrapped tator tots are the best! Atmosphere is old school... Takes me back to my childhood. Only drawback is it's always busy... That and it would be nice if you could get the beers from next door El Bait Shop!"

  "Really warm and comfy atmosphere. The dine in can\u2019t fit up to 45 people. Plenty of space but when it\u2019s the rush hour, you might have to come in early as there will be a line. Trust me, the food is worth the wait :) \n\nThe food being serve here are delicious (specially for the affordable price), you have to try out their Waveland\u2019s beat skillet! It\u2019s delicious and well season! It\u2019s a decent size for one person serving but not to worry cause you can always order anything you want in the menu half the size. My favorite food here is their hash brown, it\u2019s golden brown crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, super delicious ! \n\nThere limit parking on the front of the dine in but you can park on the street. It\u2019s usually a very short walk to the restaurant. \n\nIt\u2019s a family friendly restaurant and the waitresses here are super friendly and sweet. If you have any questions at all they will have the answer waiting for you. They serve they food hot and fast! If you\u2019re hungry, there won\u2019t be a long wait right after placing your order. \n\nHope you enjoy this dining restaurant!",
  "It was a great visit.  I'm visiting from New Orleans and love a good diner/cafe breakfast.  My cousin suggested Waveland Cafe.  It's in a quiet residential area and seems to be a popular spot.  I had pancakes n hashbrowns. Molly was a great server and took her time to make sure my order was to my liking. The food was delicious and the place was nice",
  "Great food! This was my 1st time visiting and it was extremely busy but in a good positive way...the employees were doing the best they could to manage. I would visit and suggest this place again",
  "Waveland Cafe is riding the crest of public approval these days and for good reasons! Good food, friendly service, hometown character and history.  My only complaint about the \"skillet\" meal was that it looked and tasted like an omelet over hash browns. Where's the skillet? Parking is a hassle even if you get a space out front - then it's hard to get out. Even so it was a full cafe at 10 am on Tuesday.",
  "Always great good and great service. I'm from a rural community and the Waveland is just like home. Cozy, comfortable, and hoppin'!"

After a few weeks ago when my supervisor had a sandwich with a bite out of it and had to go back and tell them about it... don't think they should be turning away business. I won't be back. too many places downtown to go to eat that will make fresh items from their menu. Maybe  they should say we won't fix things fresh off the menu any longer???!  just serve the warm sandwiches on the coolers... ick!",
  "The food is dang good, and I got a nice sized sandwich.  Service was quick, too."

  "We absolutely love this place. In fact, they closed just before the holidays and we were lost. The food is always fresh and warm. So good. The best pho in the area.",
  "Fawn's Asian Cuisine is a small stand-alone restaurant. We got there right when they opened on Saturday morning at 11 am. We didn't have a reservation, but they were quickly able to seat six of us easily.\n\nI started with their crab rangoons. They were really large, freshly made and had a very crisp shell. For my entree, I ordered the combination Lo Mein. The flavor of the sauce was fresh & gingery!\u00a0 The noodle dish contained large pieces of beef, chicken, and generously-sized prawns. It was a huge portion, and I was able to take half of it home.\n\nGreat prices, and great food!",
  "This place always pleases me. Nice choices of curries, pho or traditional Chinese . Lunches include soup, egg roll and entree. I had a tasty beef and snow peas and my buddy had chicken red curry- both were excellent.",
  "Amazing Pho! This was my first time here and I lived it. Service was super fast and extremely friendly. I had P6(chicken). The broth was very flavorful and the chicken was grilled to perfection. Will definitely be back!",
  "From the first moment  you come to this restaurant  they give you a nice feeling. Very courteous hosts, it is a kind restaurant to  pass time with friends or with your date. Great  food, qualified  chief cook and stuff, decent  pay and nice  service. Warmly recommended."

  "Our favorite neighborhood restaurant. The fajitas are awesome, and the husband has several favorites too. Chips and salsa while you wait is the perfect appetizer. \u2764",
  "Hands down my favorite restaurant. The food is always GREAT and the staff is so friendly. Even through this pandemic and having to take the orders to go, it is just as good!",
  "We arrived on a whim. Driving around at 7 PM on a Friday night looking for a decent place to eat. We drive by Tequila and decided to give it a try. It was a cozy, family-owned place with booths and tables. I ordered a Strawberry Daiquiri and he a Diet Pepsi. The salsa was nice and fresh and the queso runny, but very good. The entree came quickly. You order by number here, although it is a sit down restaurant with menus. I got #42 Shredded Beef Burrito and he the (forgot #) Tequila Burrito. Both we very good and pretty much the stand faire Mexican. However, he also ordered the Mexico City Taco which was to die for. And he said he'd order a plate full next time instead of just the one. Giving 4 stars because everything was adequate +, but a little lacking on friendliness. We intend to come back, although wouldn't make it a priority.",
  "The ladies up front are so friendly and helpful and the food is fantastic. Everything is fresh and affordable, the margaritas are strong, and the interior is warm and comfortable. Definitely the best food and service on the East side.",
  "Best Mexican food around. I grew up in so cal and this is the closest to that style of food I have found. This is my new #1 favorite Mexican food restaurant . The inside is nothing fancy but the food is good and the service is great."

  "Good food Good Service. This place has the old diner feel and look with Neon signs to boot. Breakfast to dinner options available all day. The bar is stocked but I would suggest the malts and or shakes. You can get a beer anywhere. A nicely made malt with the extra metal cup can make any day great.",
  "Excellent 50's-style restaurant with a traditional American menu from burgers, soups and sides.\n\nBoth booth and bar-style seating is available.  The service is fast and friendly.  Very popular among locals and a great place to experience if you are just visiting.\n\nThe diner can be found near Drake University.",
  "Plan some extra time it's not fast. Our server wasn't paying attention and kept saying our order wrong. At the end he brought what he wanted not what we ordered. Told him three times we didn't get a shake. Never got it but was charged. They corrected it at the register. The food that we got was really good. It's worth a try. I hope you have a better experience then we did. Keep in mind the food was good.",
  "Great landmark with perfect diner menu. Happy staff. Upbeat atmosphere and excellent blue plate specials. KILLER MILK SHAKES. particularly exceptional sweet potato fries.",
  "Really has a nostalgic feel! Staff is friendly, prices are fair, and serving size is generous. And - they have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for hard to please children! Highly recommended."

  "Most times food is not bad and when you like their food everything is wonderful but when something is done wrong they instantly blame the customer. I have ate there many times over the past year and the quality has diminished. Today was not pleasant.. the chicken was bland, gravy juice was so funny that it completely leaked out before we got home. Disappointed, not that they will care.",
  "Best sesame chicken ever. I get it Everytime and it never disappoints. You get good portions for the lunch special plus you get soup, egg roll, and crab Rangoon. Clean and very friendly staff. Chicken is lightly breaded unlike hyvee. Much more quality and value compared to Hy-Vee Chinese.",
  "I order the food and have it delivered, when the person got to my door, my food fall out the bag, he say the paper already kind of wet when he picked up. So I call restaurant and let them know, they told me is not their fault,  after talks to them for few minutes on the phone. They told me to give all the food to the guy to bring it back and they will him get us the new one, an hours later, we never got our food! I can't believe this is how they treat the customer. Try to call them , they did not answer.",
  "Love the service! The cashier lady is a hoot! Food is great and fast. The staff is very attentive even if they are busy. Love their egg rolls and fried rice. Place is always busy so you know it's liked. Highly reccomend.",
  "Inexpensive and good food. A very good value and people are very friendly"

  "Pretty tasty food in a great environment. The falafel is a bit less crunchy/crispy than you\u2019ll find at similar restaurants, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I had the falafel salad and it was very flavorful and filling. Service was quick and I enjoyed the lighting and atmosphere.",
  "The food was fresh, the meat was tender, and the Hummus was fabulous. Our waiter Brandon was very nice, and even gave me a piece of baklava for my birthday. This place is a must!",
  "This little restaurant is absolutely perfect!  It\u2019s small and quiet fit the romantic feel.  It offers a wide variety of wonderful dishes as well.  Wonderful wine selection too!",
  "As an Arab guy, THIS IS NOT AN ARABIC FOOD. And really so far away from being called Lebanese cuisine. I don\u2019t know what cuisine this is, but it sucks. If there\u2019s less than one star I\u2019ll put it.",
  "Fresh delicious food! Much like Greek food with pitas, gyros, salads, wraps and basmati rice plates. Small place but definitely worth the visit!"
