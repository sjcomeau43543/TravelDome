   "Welcoming and clean. I always enter on the far end and stroll my way through. They have such a variety of foods. The cheese selection is one of the best in the country and they offer suggestions of pairing with an amazing array of wines from all over the world. The fresh meat and fish are spectacular....and if you want to just sit and have coffee and people watch this is a great spot. SoHo is an amazing restaurant and the frittata is massive and delicious. The wait staff delightful and the manager, William a gem. \n\nEverytime I am in Charleston this place is on my MUST GO places. It should be your also. PS right across the street diagonally is an amazin Bread Store too with gluten free options that rock.",
   "The capitol market is a lovely place to buy locally grown food and other plants. I would definitely recommend visiting! The vendors are lovely and the selection is large. It\u2019s a nice place to walk around even if you don\u2019t plan on purchasing anything. My only complaint is that parking can be an issue depending on the season. Otherwise 10/10 would recommend! :)",
   "Friendly family type atmosphere.  Great food.  You have to try the fish dinners!!!   They have everything.  Lots of West Virginia crafts including books and locally grown produce.  If you go you will love it and will go back.",
   "Love shopping here. All the indoor and outdoor shops and vendors are super friendly and helpful. They will literally take the time to help you find exactly what you are looking for.",
   "I loved this market. It is definitely a diamond in the rough. It is bright,fresh,clean,and busy. I started with getting a salad from the purple onion and I also purchased the best honey crisp apples ever, I then went to Mecca Coffee and Holls chocolate. The people were all so polite and helpful with the exception of the sales employee at Holls. Their chocolates were amazing so it made up for a rude employee. This market also sell wine,fresh,fruits and veggies,houses a restaurant,sells fresh cute meat,seafood,and sushi. I will definitely come back during my monthly business visit.\nEnjoy the photos!"

   "Amazing museum that tells West Virginia's history in a creative and fun way. Following the timeline and seeing the scenery change as you walk through was really fascinating. On top of that, there are areas with artifacts that you can step off the timeline and view. I do wish that the artifact rooms didn't make you jump past parts of the time lines at times and that there was a way to reset the speaking, as sometimes you'd trip the sensor for the next part before you were done with the last one.",
   "Incredible museum showcasing the amazing history of West Virginia. The quality of displays and artifacts is outstanding, especially considering the admission is free! You could spend hours upon hours walking this museum and still not see everything. You can tell they really care about the museum and have put a lot of time and effort into it. Quite an exceptional place.",
   "This museum has a great collection of exhibits with an interactive walk through format. Be sure to make time for the various short films and interactive programs in each exhibit that flesh out the history represented by the objects in the cases. Kids have a chance to get more involved by completing a scavenger hunt!",
   "I visited the Genealogy library at the Cultural Center.  They have an excellent array of vital documents, wills, newspapers, land records. Etc plus reference materials. Watch out for the parking police!",
   "I took my teenaged son to the museum while we were in the area to visit my father over Christmas. We were both overwhelmed by the attention to detail everywhere we looked within multiple VAST displays of West Virginia history! Before arriving, I was seriously expecting a long boring walk highlighting the finer points of the coal industry (no offense). But this place completely blew me away! The museum does feature several displays on the history of coal mining, it's a rich part of the state's heritage, but the presentation goes exceedingly beyond mere coal. Featuring civil war relics, the humble beginnings of the emancipation proclamation, President Lincoln, Daniel Boon, Byrd, Yeager, the state police, crafts, all the way back to geological specimens AND MUCH MORE (including a robot). Stop by if you're curious and in the area, expect to spend a couple hours. My son and I both want to go back so we have more time."

   "Criel Mound in South Charleston WV is a Sacred Burial Site  where the Indians were laid to rest in this mound formation.\nMany people visit this historical site to see this amazing structure and read the provided information about it.\nThere is stairs that go up to the top to get a scenic overlook and a bench to sit on to rest or take pictures.\nThis is a unique place to visit and even have a afternoon \ud83e\uddfa picnic.",
   "Love discovering ancient earthworks and burial mounds. Should not have brought the child... she spilled a bag of Doritos all over the top of the burial mound, we cleaned it all up but I am now waiting to see if she is haunted.",
   "It is amazing to interact with a pre-historic monument right in the center of South Charleston. I am sad that so much the great ceremonial mound village in Dunbar and South Charleston is now lost to us. Take care and honor the aspects of it that are left.",
   "It certainly is an ancient burial mound. Definitely a cool visit if you're already in the area for the purpose of experiencing history, but its closeness to modern things like Dollar General I find a bit jarring.",
   "Great information explaining about the Criel Mound around the site. My issue is all the litter that was on the grounds. You can visit this site in less than thirty minutes.  I learned a lot about these native Americans and their way of life in this region."

I myself have done well over 200 escape rooms all over the world.  These rooms were well thought out.  The immersion was very good.  I highly recommend if your in WV.  Trying them out.  It will be well worth it.  Thank You Locked and Coded for the great time and the Owner was awesome.  I am sorry I can't for the life of me remember your name.  But you were awesome.  We will be back.  When were back in Charleston.",

A little more expensive than the movies but the exercising is priceless. There's space for toddlers too, so children of all ages (and adults too) can enjoy the art of jump. :)",
   "We brought a group of 55 middle school students from 1.5 hours away and Sky Zone was really phenomenal to work with!  Leading up to the actual trip I gave a best guess on our amount of jumpers so I was trying to update Sky Zone as best I could and they just really rolled with it and helped us so that everyone was able to jump.  The check-in process took a minute but only because there were so many of us, they really were patient and helpful with us.\n\nPlus the variety of options to jump was really great.  They had a rock wall, two obstacle courses, and a toddler area.  In addition to various other jumping options.  Overall I was really impressed and appreciative of Sky Zone taking time to work with us and get us all ready to go!",

Just a 3\u2019 path of boards would open the trail. Sorry I am biking elsewhere.",

It's just off the Mary Knight or Oak trail.  You can enter off Henry C. Shores Dr. and enter the road that states \"Areas 6-20\" (38.383639, -81.580449). You will see benches on the left and can park there (38\u00b023'06.8\"N 81\u00b034'40.5\"W). Walk on the dirt road which curves around the right but don't follow it all the way to the building. Once the you see the building at the same level as you, head towards the first set of coordinates towards the grotto and you'll see some stairs which give access. :-)",
   "Coonskin has changed a lot since I was going there since early 70's. Still a great place. Saw 2 family soldiers off to deployments to middle east. Both are WV Army National Guard. One is seasoned veteran and one is first time deployed. A great place to celebrate their deployment of service with BBQ and family fellowship."

   "My 7 year old daughter had a blast. It is usually very difficult to gain her attention. If you do get her attention, it's near impossible to keep it for long. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by Nathan. He was very friendly and made sure that we knew about everything they had to offer. He saw my daughter and told us all about the children's center, a place where she could do crafts and learn about West Virginia history hands on. We were here for nearly 2 hours and honestly could've stayed longer. She had so much fun and loved the exhibits. She wanted to spend all day in the children's center and asked to go back in several times. The entire experience was free and very educational.",

   "A nice play area. Tons of slides and climbing obstacles. A little dated and a bit muddy after some rain, but good. A great flat, grassy field and gravel track.  Exercise obstacles on the track, too. Parking above and at park level. Not far from the highway.",
   "Great place for parents and kids. Running track with some exercise equipment for big people, playground for little people. Interesting setting- tucked away on top of a hill in a little sunken field, view of the open sky. Three little stone tables sit under a shelter by the playground. Run around the track or sit in the shade and watch the kids play. Unique park.",

The sound of the running water alone is hypnotic.\n\nAre you a disc golf fan? You can play here inside the park. Challenging hills if you decide to hike up them. An overall gorgeous place to forest bathe. Get outside and enjoy nature in this park.",
   "Beautiful park. It really surprised us how beautiful this park was. We walked by the cellars up a trail and you walk up a hill and there is a beautiful lake. The cellars are historically magical and would tell you so many stories if they could talk. We will be back to explore more of the trails. Also, they have disc golf!",
   "Wine Cellar Park offers beautiful scenic trails, a older playground, a fishing lake and shelter.Its family oriented where you can also walk your dog, have family picnics and hike together.\nThe park has wooden bridges throughout the trail, a historic fort \nwhich contribute to the-rustic look of the park and it\u2019s appeal.\n I enjoy nature very much and finding about this gem of a park was a great find\nI hope you come have some fun at this wonderful place.",

As a mom it\u2019s nice to have a staff that loves your kids as much as you do, and this is definitely that staff! It\u2019s a 45 minute drive for us and it\u2019s so worth it!",

My oldest has had to have work done and I couldn\u2019t thank Mrs Holly & Dr. Wilkerson enough for the patients they showed him and how fast they work. I wish the office seen adults! I have three children and when I walk in their always asking if I need help. It\u2019s just a all around wonderful establishment!",
   "This office is the bomb dot com. We drive over an hour away for my daughter to see Dr Wilkerson. We love her and the entire staff!! Always so friendly and helpful and VERY VERY patient with my girl who tends to throw a huge fit. By the end of it she\u2019s happy and we\u2019re headed home in a matter of no time. From start to finish of anything she\u2019s ever had done we\u2019ve never been there over an hour and that is a win in my book. I will continue to make the drive to come to this office!!!",

At the last appointment that my two oldest children had, I brought along my two youngest, 3yo twins. My twins were so upset that it wasn\u2019t their appointment and they didn\u2019t get to sit in the chair! The dental assistant that finished first let them sit in the chair and \u2018cleaned their\u2019 teeth. It made them feel like they got the experience and it will hold them over until their scheduled appointment.\nAll the ladies in the office go out of their way to make the dentist a fun experience! My kids complain that their appointment isn\u2019t soon enough!",

Taking my kids to the dentist is never a walk in the park so going there they make it seem so easy and help anytime my kids start throwing a fit! Dr. Wilkerson is the sweetest! Office is super clean and kid friendly! And it makes it much better that they\u2019re quick and get us in there and get the job done! \nI wouldn\u2019t take my kids anywhere else! \u2764\ufe0f"

The swimming pool is kept very clean, and there is an outdoor stage for concerts and plays. Durinf the summer they have an outdoor movie night. During November and December they have The Festival of Lights. A beautiful display of Christmas lights that you drive thru and at the end, Santa is setting in his rocking chair. The kids can visit with him and enjoy hot chocolate. Oh, important note...the lights are closed on Christmas eve and Christmas day. They reopen December 26.",

I could get the best room for less than rooms at the parks in Canaan Valley (peak in winter months).  The lodge is dated, but the room amenities are nice, and considering that breakfast was included with the room, this was a good deal.  The power went out for about eight hours due to a storm, but the crews got it back on hours before the projected repair time.  The lodge was beautifully decorated, and very homey.  The area is not far from Fayetteville, and the New River Gorge Bridge.  This is definitely on my list--I can't wait to return and stay longer next time!",

   "Great place to see! Not hard to find! During off season go use the restroom at a nearby gas station first. Also the island in the sky trail is across from the mill. The walk is about 20 minutes one way and I'm fat and got up there just fine. There are two small mad made ladders on the trail to get up some rocks. Not too scary. Do it and have fun!",
   "Babcock State Park met my expectations of a private forest retreat surrounded by the beauty of fall season. My friend and I stayed in an economy cabin that included a queen size bunk bed, kitchen, two dressers, bathroom, screened in porch, fire pit, picnic table, and grill. I loved building fires and standing outside under the moon, stars, and beautiful fall foliage. The cabin experience could be considered rustic but other than needing a little bathroom dusting, it was clean, organized, and expended at an excellent price. We loved walking around the park between overlooks, the grist mill, and the lake. The roads were in great condition and the park itself looked well maintained. The hospitality was remarkable. Well done staff of Babcock State Park:)",
   "Beautiful park. Stopped by the grist mill, took some great pictures. Enjoyed the sound of the water. Very relaxing. Hiked around the lake. Trail was well maintained. One of my favorite hikes yet. Easy to moderate so nothing too strenuous yet good for the soul.",
   "By far one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen! We took so many pictures and plan on using the for calendars. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone!",
   "I really like this place, lots of trails for hiking and biking. Plus the lake is a nice feature. Their is a grist mill that you can walk through which is the parks main attraction but it has very limited hours. There is a gift shop their that's has some nice things. The down sides pretty much are the grist mill isnt open much, theirs no place to get anything more then snacks atleast 10 minutes from the park, and you cant swim in the lake."

   "A neat little tourist trap using optical illusions and physics to warp your senses. Definitely heed the warnings. On the outside, just a small shack that goes about 3 levels deep but the name alone and the outside aethetics catch your eye to bring you in to a tour guide who is quite a showman himself. An alright stop if you have time to kill or are in the surrounding camp grounds and parks.",
   "Quick fun stop. Great views and pretty good parking. I did feel a difference  in the gravity room, but it did seem like the feeling was magnified by the built angles in the room. It felt like the demonstrator tried to creep out the crowd. They try hard to make the experience last longer than what it really should, which is appreciated... but honestly I felt dizzy and was ready for it to be over. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time because it was a fun experience with my family. We also saw 2 waterfalls along the route to mystery hole, so overall it was a fun family experience!\nNote: the website says no large back packs or purses, so we took small ones and was still told they couldn't be taken in, on a positive note the shop offered free lockers to store our bags",

The overall facility is very well laid out, maintained by a great dedicated group of knowledgeable people. There's even Retired Coal Miners that were there to run the buggy back in the ground to experience the mining industry. They were very friendly and knowledgeable, answering every question regardless of the relatively. We really enjoyed going in the Old Camp Buildings, Houses, and Schools. The HandsOn Caboose was a great big hit with our younger children in the group. The Gift Shop was great as well, and the fudge.... well I wish I would have bought more and more. Thanks for sharing your facility,  teaching us the history of mining and not letting it die.",
   "I really enjoyed it all. It is a small coal mine tour and a small recreation of a coal mine village. But it gives you a complete picture of how this area of the country grew and functioned. For those of us who had relatives in the industry, we get a snap shot of what life was all about.",
   "While this exhibition is naturally a sanitized version of the \"real thing\";  particularly, the height of the main line, there is quite a bit of true and accurate representations of what coal mining was like mainly circa 1950.  The park itself is a little difficult to find, so follow your GPS VERY carefully.  The parking is ample and accommodating for RV's.  The Rahall Coal Country Store is an excellent exhibit itself.",
   "Wonderful place with very nice people. Would definitely recommend this place for the whole family. Lots of history about coal mining and a overall great experience.",
   "Loved it! Real underground coal mine! Guide was great!, friendly,  super informative and funny! All the homes and old items in them was nice to see too. Ladies in the gift shop were so sweet. Speaking of sweet, we loved their fudge!  Easy parking right in front. Glad we went."

   "Very cheap admission and interesting displays, but don't expect to spend a large amount of time here-- the standard Mothman enthusiast will probably spend at most an hour browsing through the two main rooms and watching the short film. The gift shop was fantastic, with a large amount of Mothman knickknacks and souvenirs to show off to family and friends back home. The statue outside the museum is also a great photo opportunity.",

(Although I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect that kind of speed every single time, as how quickly they\u2019re made obviously depends on your prescription, the delivery service, etc). The lady who dispensed them - I think her name was Tara, was also very nice and helpful. She adjusted my glasses perfectly. I\u2019ll definitely be coming back here for future purchases. Better service, cleaner store, better deals, and better frame selection than ANY place in Charleston. These are my favorite glasses I\u2019ve ever gotten!! If you come here, definitely ask for Melissa or Tara if available. 11/10 recommend this place.",

I've already told many friends and my social media about how great Tara was and to always go to this location. Thank you for given me my sight again Terra!!!",

I had quite a few picks I liked couldn't make my mind up, and Tara helped me a lot and kept it real. She's the real mvp. She was extremely nice, and because of everyone being so friendly I will be back. I will be telling people about this."

   "So much fun was had! We will definitely be going back to revisit. Everyone was so. Ice and there was so much to do."

   "Cute bookshop with new, used, and super cheap sections.  They have a coffee shop that I haven't tried but smells amazing. But the really neat thing is the art show that changes out often on one side of the store. Friendly staff.",

   "Not a bad mountain at all. Good for beginner to intermediate riders. Weather conditions were awesome. Staff was friendly and helpful. They offer a great exchange program. If your board/skis break or you want to try a different size/style of board or ski, you can use your own board/ski as collateral, and they will let you use a rental at no cost. My bindings broke and I got to try out a few different size boards. Pretty cool if your looking to try something different. Again, not a great expert mountain, but really good for beginners and intermediate riders.",
   "This place is awesome. Very friendly staff and very helpful. Had a great time, book an all in one package with the lesson, it was great. Conditions were perfect everything went well. Couldn't be happier with my experience. Make sure you come early and prepare to spend about an hour inside filling out paper work and getting fitted for gear before you hit the slopes.  All in all it was Awesome!",
   "The lessons were not as good as I thought they would be. The slopes needed a bit more snow on them. And it was very difficult to find out which slopes were open or not. On the other hand, it was SKIING so lots of fun there! It was a great experience to go hang out with friends and family, and they had very nice people working which was surprising considering how many people they have to deal with everyday. So I would check it out. I loved it. It was a great weekend.",
   "Visited Winterplace New year's day. Fortunately they had a little bit of natural snow overnight but they did have to produce snow as well. They had a little over half of their runs open. Had a very enjoyable day of skiing. The resort was run efficiently. Staff was excellent. The cafe food was not that great but did the job. If you are looking for an affordable day of skiing you should checkout Winterplace ski resort.",
   "Snow not being made daily so check the cams/weather before you go . If your staying at mountain inn be aware it's all stairs and no elevators so you'll be lugging stuff up with no bell man or bell carts. The bedrooms are also above , loft style so pack light or get ready to carry a lot. Having said that great resort . We had Dwight as a private instructor 3 days in a row and was great with our 4 yr old.\n\nOverall very friendly staff , easy parking, and easy to get around, book lessons, rent gear etc."

Years ago it was a fantastic place to go but it's quite dirty now and kind of I really don't know the correct word just didn't feel it he's there.",

I love that they have plenty of rides for younger children because, in the past, I have taken my little boy to fairs and carnivals where he wasn't able to ride any of the rides (because he wasn't tall enough)! I would pay for a wristband so he could ride, the kid rides, all day! So, I will definitely be visiting this place in the future!\n The reason it didn't get a five star rating is because a few of the rides could use a little TLC!!

Have a detailed map and good sturdy shoes. Know and remember where the water sources are. get there really early like at the crack of dawn in order to find parking. This can be a very busy place.

I brought a hundred thirty thousand pounds back down...\nIt was challenging took a long time to go very short distance.. 60 miles in 2 hours...\nYes that's 30 miles per hour...\nLong-haul truckers would be broke if every hour went like that..\nso trying to tell you this is some beautiful West Virginia countryside and I'd recommend to pass through here.. \nAnd by the way the folks I met up there are very helpful and friendly.\nI recommend this area for all folks both commercially and for income.. and to see a very beautiful land.",

   "Wow. I loved my Vegetarian Burger. The place was soo interesting and informative. Postings for all the concerts in the area. Beautiful decor that fit the theme. I had a gin and tonic that was great and they have a wonderful selection of drinks to choose from. I definitely am putting this one on the must do when in Charleston list . I loved that the whole staff was friendly and helpful but not intrusive.",
   "Very hip joint! Live music. Cool art for sale on the walls and an awesome selection of cocktails! Our server had us laughing and enjoying ourselves while doing her job very well. The food all came out beautifully. A unique menu that changes frequently. Looking forward to another visit",
   "I like this restaurant. The service is always good and the food never disappoints. I had  dinner here with my partner on a recent Friday eve. Jeff had the pork chops with sweet mashed potatoes and asparagus and liked it very much. I had the fish and chips which were served hot and delicious and a very good spinach salad with fresh vegetables, warm bacon and strawberry vinaigrette- yum!",
   "Food and service is always top notch. Definitely one of our favorite restaurants. Love the atmosphere. Wine and beer selection is also very good. Highly recommend.",
   "Beautiful vibe and delicious big portion plates! Bar tender gets 5 stars for the amazing cocktails."

   "The owner personally went up to every table to and checked to make sure everything was great. The drinks were amazing. The waiter was busy but still personable. I had a great meal in a great atmosphere. This was my first time to Charleston, WV and it was great",
   "Decent food. Good atmosphere but seems a little.....reserved. In that, I mean, staff seems more intent on talking among themselves & patrons seemed to keep to themselves.\nBeer was good. But weirdly, their website has NO beers advertised, nothing.\nIt's a brewery. In order to find out what they have available, you have to call. It's VERY odd.",
   "WE GOT FOOD POISONING! My friend and I were passing through Downtown Charleston  and thought this place looked good. we both ordered tacos and spend the whole rest of the night throwing them up. We then had food poisoning for the next 24 hours. If you order tacos here MAKE SURE THEY ARE COOKED CORRECTLY.",
   "Stopped for lunch, this restaurant has adequate seating for a party of 200! A fully stocked bar, bartender included! Wait staff is prompt and friendly. Dining area's appear clean and stocked with appropriate condiments. I ordered the barbacoa beef quesadillas and coke. The portion was plentiful, the barbacoa was extremely mild but flavorful. The choice of  cheese & flour tortilla complements the beef nicely.  On the side was a small portion of black beans mixed with corn an something else, it tastes like their take on pico \"maybe\". It was fresh and flavorful, excellent addition to the quesadilla. I requested a side of their salsa \"no up charge\". The salsa is prepared fresh, mild and packed with the flavor of authentic Mexican salsa! I was mildly impressed \u263a. Coke was over iced, definitely ask for light ice. I scored them at 4 stars, solely on the price! My single quesadilla and coke was $13.50 before tip! I rate their price as 20% overvalued. However, I can see why they would need that additional 20%, their location and dining room size is what they are charging for in this instance. This would be a great restaurant to hold banquets, group lunches, celebrations etc. Honestly, Black sheep should market this highlight to bring in additional guests!!! Huge untapped growth potential!!! My opinion is the additional 20% cost is justifiable but unnecessary with further business development. To reiterate, I had a excellent dinning experience and will return in the near future! They do offer local delivery in the downtown area, I forgot to ask about any order minimums!",
   "Enjoyed the beer, an IPA. Chicken burrito was OK, appeared to have little chicken and more beans. Wife's Thai Peanut with tofu was better. Located in downtown area, staff was good, we arrived about an hour before closing and just needed a quick bite. We found street parking fairly easily and just walked to the restaurant"

   "Hands down, the best brisket I've had! Great smoke flavor, slightly crisp crust, and a fantastic rub...no need for any sauce. The ribs are amazing as well. The baked beans have the perfect amount of brown sugar, not too sweet...just a great flavor. This is a must stop for anyone in, or passing through, Charleston. I'm jealous that I live out of state and can't eat this regularly. I'm in town for another 5 days and will probably eat here 5 more times. As a bonus, BB King was playing the entire time I was eating. \ud83d\udc4d",
   "Best BBQ we've had possibly ever. We went on a roadtrip to Charleston and was looking for a good place that wasn't a chain restaurant.  We couldn't have been happier with our choice  great service and the best sauce I've ever had. It could make my shoe taste good  great brisket and chicken. Also the baked beans were a special treat.",
   "The ribs had excellent  smoke flavor. I had asked for sauce to be on the side but instead they were on top. The wings were deep fried extra  crunchy. Sauces were a bit sweeter than I cared for. But the flavor of the meat made up for it",
   "Overall, it was pretty good. We had a late lunch, so I'm a little more forgiving that the brisket was a little dry. The pork was also more shredded than pulled, but that also could've just been what was left at the end of lunch. The sauce was pretty tasty, and the beans were really good - almost too sweet to believe they were beans! The portions are pretty fair for what you pay and service is decent but not great. Lots of TVs, if you're trying to watch some football.",
   "Neat inner city bbq joint. Flavoring was very good. Nice size portions. Great place to enjoy a cheap bbq platter."

   "Rio De Grill has a reasonably priced lunch buffet that, if you have tiny children (under 5), is a real deal. The MEATS! Our youngest loves the 'pepper' (what he calls the prime rib). The garlic bread is worth the price of admission.",
   "Great Service and Good Food. Endless meats. The pineapple and garlic bread were great. Looks like they are starting to update the decor. The flashing lights around the bar were alittle distracting along with the ribbon along the ceiling. It wasn't busy at all for a Friday Night. The chafing dishes could be shined up and bar refreshed. Overall a good experience and will definitely go back.",
   "If you love meats then this is the place for you! The variety of steak, chicken, pork, and grilled pineapple are excellent. The cold bar I don't care for, I feel like they could have a better variety of things. Worth the money tho if you are a meat eater.",
   "Great food at decent prices. Although it's a bit expensive, I would not say it's overpriced, especially for the prime rib, which is excellent! I would come here again. If you have a coupon it's even better!",
   "We were there with a group of 10 or 12 for lunch a couple of days after Christmas. The wait staff handled our group with ease. They continually brought out different types of meat, which were all pretty tasty. The garlic bread was awesome. My only complaints are that I wish they had a better variety of foods on the buffet. Also, would be nice to have a better selection of dessert. Over all, it was a great experience, and I would eat there again."

   "Very fancy place with a more upscale clientele than the surrounding restaurants. The service was exceptional and very attentive. The prices are high as to be expected in a wine bar. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine selection. However the Tapas Valencia we ordered was completely lacking in flavor and tasted almost like water. There was absolutely zero spice in the dish at all.",
   "Beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere. Enjoyed several appetizers (the pulled pork tator tots were way too good to stop for a photo), and was very impressed with the flavor of the lemon caper chicken I had for dinner. Dessert was just... heavenly! The waiters were attentive and knowledgeable, and ensured a good evening as well. I'm looking forward to returning soon!",
   "Delicious food and nice atmosphere.\nI definitely suggest getting the olives if you are an olive fan (they are seeded though so keep that in mind).\nMy wife and I had the salmon and scallops and both were fantastic!",
   "Absolutely amazing restaurant.  A business buddy and I were in Charleston for the nite and this place was recommended by a local.  It is 100% as good as any restaurant in any major city of America.  Great wine list and wine steward and scrumptious food.  Loved the variety of choices and had a very hard time making a selection.\n\nI will absolutely be eating at this restaurant again and again on my returns to Charleston.",

The food we well prepared and the seafood was excellent an fresh!! I would highly recommend giving them a chance to wow you!",
   "This is over 2 trips. It feels little out of place or maybe because I'm not familiar with the area. The attempt to be a fresh seafood place is good. The seafood was actual very fresh but taste wise I think they fall a bit short. I wanted to going 3.5 stars. The servers a warm and welcoming. Thank you Chelsea for great service. It one of the better options available in the area.",
   "Stopped here from out of town. Our waiter was extremely friendly and informative, and they were very accommodating to dietary needs/choices. Management staff was also walking around the restaurant throughout our meal. It was nice to see the hands-on approach.",
   "This time at Tidewater I chose to dine at there elegant bar,however many times prior i have ate in the dining room with the wooden tables and fishery decor giving it a feel of a restaurant along the coast.\nI chose a porter beer bottled from great lakes brewery and it was wonderful.\nThere menu is full of fish entree\u2019s ... catch of the day, juicy steaks ,delicious chicken dishes and many more  items ...plus appetizers, salads and tantalizing deserts.\nSomething for everyones liking but my choice was the fish and chips which went perfect with my porter.\nThe generous crispy melt in your mouth fish, seasoned fries and deliciously crunchy hush puppies was absolutely perfect.\nThe bartender was there making sure i had ever thing i needed and was very attentive.\nIf you want to make a impression on someone ,take a loved one out or just treat yourself  to a exquisite dining experience then go to one of the best Restaurants in Charleston Wv \n Tidewater Grill",
   "Over priced with average service.  I have had better fish at Long John silvers.  Not sure how this place stays open.  Chili's and outback across the hall serve better food with more polite servers.  Not impressed.  My friend ordered a salad with her meal and everything she did not want was on it.  The prices are ridiculous, the atmosphere is loud and bar/grill style not a fine restaurant as they try to advertise.  Would never waste my money or time to return.  At the prices they charge customers should not have to wave down the server."

But the quality is not the same anymore. My family used to order takeout every weekend as part of our family weekend tradition. Its just not there for me anymore. Staff is friendly but no wow factor in service. Food has become bland or overly greasy.",

   "Very good Mexican food of the many choices in the Charleston area. Everyone in my party was pleased with their entrees. Nice decor.",
   "I wish I could rate this local business higher but I just can't. The two stars they have received are for some of the staff being 'kind' and their ability to accommodate large parties. The remaining stars are missing for several reasons. \n\nFirstly, the food. The food tastes cheap. While some of the dishes sound great on paper the execution is largely let down by the poor ingredients. My family often find ourselves here to give them another chance due to their ability to seat our extended family but they have continued to drop the ball. More often than not we return home and the majority of the family finds themselves sick. \n\nSecondly, the service. While some members of the staff are very helpful and effective waiters/waitresses the majority aren't attentive. They don't watch the tables and act like it's a chore to take care of the guests. When dealing with management it is apparent where this mindset stems from. \n\nI want to see this Kanawha City business find success but currently they aren't on the right path.",
   "Great Mexican food. Fast and friendly service. I've hada quick lunch and a relaxing dinner there and it's good for both. Large portions and good selection. Can seat large groups but also had some cozy spots for just two. A great place in Charleston to grab a bite of Mexican food.",
   "My first visit. The food was very good. It was hot too. Very friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is clean and comfortable seating too.",

I tasted it and I could not tell the difference between that and regular crust.\n\nThey want you to drink alcohol, so the water glasses are tiny (see picture).

   "This is a very nice and large sports bar that is well maintained. It wasn't very crowded when we arrived however the service at the bar was still slow. The margarita was nice and refreshing on a hot day. The chicken tacos were so dry they were they hard to eat. Most likely pre-made chicken that was reheated to long? The draft beer I ordered had a layer of soapy ice float to the top which I couldn't drink. Probably the glass wasn't rinsed and dried properly before being frosted?  All places have a off day or period at times so I'll return in the future to give it another go.",
   "Food was fantastic, very filling and came at a decent price too. Fun sports bar atmosphere inside, liked the green carpeted floors that reminded me of putt-putt/mini-golf. Large space inside, perfect for groups or other large parties, staff was pretty quick and attentive to our needs. Happy we chose to eat here while in Charleston!"

   "It's not fair to the other places I've been to compare this review to those because tonight SHE was with me again and this is where we first met so I'm already taken with everything about this place. The service was consistently superb but truthfully I wouldn't have known of it was awful because all I could do was look at her and talk to her and pinch myself inside that we were here together again. She is so spectacularly wonderful and infinitely beautiful in every sense of the word both inside and out so you could not remove the joy off my face tonight with a chisel and a hammer. And so you begin to see why I love this place so. The meal was just delicious and the experience outstanding.",
   "Waitress wasn't very attentive but she was nice.  Food priced a little higher than I would have expected, especially considering how old the building is.  Food was good and portion sizes normal.  We asked for oil for the bread and they charged us $1.50 for it without mentioning.  I'd give them a 3.5*. I eat there every other Black Friday dinner (once every 2 years) and this was my 4th time there.",

   "Went for a work dinner and really liked it! The atmosphere is peaceful and intimate, with a beautiful interior design. The cocktails were delicious (slightly strong - but not complaining!) and the food was also great. I got the parmesan encrusted chicken with risotto and asparagus. There was enough for me to take home for lunch for the next day, and it still tasted just as good! The strawberry shortcake I had for dessert was possibly the best I've had! Definitely would recommend.",
   "Great ambience, as well as tasty food. My only complaint was there was no appetizers offered outside of having to buy an appetizer. Thus resulting in being slightly less than completely full at the end of our meals. This could have been easily avoided if something small was offered to guest free of charge, such as bread and butter or chips and a dip for example. I feel as if you buy two 45 dollar steaks, the appetizer should come with it. Otherwise good food and a nice atmosphere. \ud83d\udc4d",
   "Had a overall wonderful experience for a New Years Eve dinner with the family.  They were able to accommodate a large group.  Wait staff were attentive and on point, even with the large group.  They offered a special meal with both wine and bourbon pairings which were excellent.  Only criticism would be over the wife's scallops on her surf and turf, they were cold and rubbery.  Will definitely be back.",
   "Experiences have been too mixed and too unreliable to recommend. Calamari is always very nice, but hardly 5 star.  Linguine with seafood was very rich and tasty, scallops were done perfectly and normally I stay away from them. Despite this, we had written off Bricks and Barrels years ago due to consistent and stunning shortcomings for such high prices, like a $45 australian lamb that ended up being four nuggets on ribs, with so much fat they were inedible. That's $11.25 per nugget. They also seem to have a delusional obsession with reservations; we were twice turned away even though the place was mostly open. On one of those occasions we just had appetizers at the bar and the place never even close to filled up. The private barrels are cozy if you can get one, even though they're not taken, as a former restaurant host, that's like burning money. The decor is nice and rustic, but the glass top barrel tables end up being too awkward to sit at for long, and shouldn't lean on them.  So we went one last time more out of reckless abandon even though we reviewed their disappointments on the way. We again could not get any open table, sat at the bar with good beer selection, but and were served pints not even close to filled, did ask for them to be topped off, but our moment of trust was already punished with this \"beertrayal\", so we did not stay for dinner or even another round. This can be a problem with places serving too much head and skimping on the beer, so yes, I have this gauge, but I think this is a record low pour. I really wanted this to work... never again.",
   "We reserved a barrel, which we were assured was confirmed, only to find out we would not be eating in one. The hostess informed us that waiting for one would be a couple of hours (someone was sat in one the first 15 minutes we were there). A couple people wanted burgers, which we were then told that they weren't doing \"handheld items\" this weekend. The service was absolutely horrible. Honestly our waitress acted like she couldn't have cared less. Food took forever, along with anything else we needed. I ordered the seafood alfredo, and the pasta came out cold. It was disgusting. For the price you pay for this food, I expect more, and so should anyone else. And if you reserve a barrel, you should get a barrel. I'm glad I didn't show my disappointment while I was there, because from the sound of these remarks from the owner, they enjoy being sarcastically caring, and don't really care if people are displeased. This establishment will not last. Save your money and go elsewhere."

   "I would not come back here if they paid me. I\u2019ve been to other locations so I know to expect, at best, about 3.5-star food. This location is 1-star operated. Apparently, even with five people at times, they can\u2019t handle the simple task of managing the seating. I went as a party of three.  Twenty minutes later, they took a walk-in party of four ahead of me. During the enlightening wait for a table, I saw someone seated when first walked in had barely received any attention anyway. I saw servers and managers milling about the front desk during their peak time. If you value your time, go elsewhere. There are plenty of options in this area.",
   "Great place to eat for good prices. Tried the new Top Sirloin today; it was amazing, and only $12.99! Fast, courteous service with a smile. Always a favorite of mine for lunch, dinner, or a fun night out!",
   "Fantastic food, fantastic service.   Had a group of 16.   Speedy and everything was right the first time.  Tommy was our server and went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied.   Definitely be back.",
   "This wing establishment is well known and this location is what you would expect if you have been to any other in PA. The wings are awesome. I don\u2019t usually vary from ordering the wings because this is why you should come. The pic is the Louisiana sauce. Add some Tabasco and beer and that is it for me. This place has been around or a long time so the locals know it. If you are staying next door at the Hampton, stop by.",
   "Last time we went, the waitress wasnt friendly, my dad's order was messed up and it took talking to the manager to get it straightened out and still ended up over paying. Food was okay but some of it seemed old. Or like it was cooked out of order. We probably wont be back for a while which is sad because the one in my hometown is great and I miss the food. But this experience was not worth it."

Clean restaurant and fast service.  Ok so down falls only sauce available was ketchup , mustard , mayo and hot sauce.  They had no slaw either.  The frys tated good but was thin cut.  Which is cool if you like that type.  The price was decent as well.  The fried apple pie was not something I personally would do again.   So I give this restaurant a 3 or of 5  all over.  Service alone I could have done a 5 and the burger alone a 4.5 . So if your in the area stop in and try.  I've also been told breakfast is wonderful from other guests....",

Highly recommend giving them a try whether you have time to sit down or you are on a time crunch and takeout.

We try to eat there at least once a week because it is just that good. You won't be disappointed.",

   "This place is a little tricky to find, but it's worth the effort. Small dining room with about 10 tables. Friendly and helpful staff. The food is fantastic. The wife gets Pan Kee Mao with chicken, I get Massaman Curry Chicken with fried rice. Both are very good. Food is always very fresh and hot. Anything above \"Little spice\" is quite spicy, but I go up to \"medium spice\" because I like a kick to my food. Price is very reasonable for the quality and service. We eat here a couple times per month.",

   "Delicious food! My husband and I went for Valentine's Day dinner. They were pretty busy. However, they were prompt and checked on us frequently. We don't come to Charleston often, but would undoubtedly eat here again the next time we are in town.",
   "Wendy is THE BEST waitress...  NEVER  a bad meal. Always clean. No Mexican restaraunt in the state measures up to It!!! 2 locations can be found..... Ashton place shopping area and St. Albans near old rivers edge restaraunt.  Most authentic Mexican flavors I have ever had. We will ALWAYS go there for mexican\u00b0",
   "Cozumel is a fantastic place to eat. If you enjoy good Mexican food this is the place to get it. If you appreciate a friendly attentive waitress eat here.if you enjoy life entertainment while you're having your meal this is the place to go. With the authentic Mexican decor and widescreen TVs I would recommend Cozumel to anyone passing through South Charleston.\nWhen I was ready to leave my waitress made sure I had all the necessary containers to take my leftovers with me. A bag for the chips a cup for the salsa a go-cup for my drink and a handy box for the remainder of my tasty fajita.",
   "Quick to serve, great drinks, fantastic food!! Love the atmosphere and the staff! That cozumel dip just doesn't quit! \ud83d\ude0b",
   "This place is actually kind of tasty. But unfortunately I cannot call this a Mexican restaurant as I am from San Diego and I've had real Mexican food. However the atmosphere is great, the people that take care of your orders are always very friendly, the outside serving area is actually nice when it is hot outside, and they are very expedient when it comes to taking drink orders. I came here for a going away party for one of my fellow coworkers and they made sure that everything was taken care of a hundred percent while we were there. No questions asked I would definitely recommend going here."

   "They are slow when you go in but they are exceptionally slow when you were picking up. We waited over 50 minutes for 1/2 club sandwich. I checked on it twice in person, and the third time I called because there were people at the crowded front door who were not wearing masks, including a Dunbar police officer. But then they told us it was ready and would bring it right out. We knew there was one car ahead of us but 4 others we're at the front door besides those of us waiting in our cars. \n  After 8 more minutes (total= 56 minutes) after not seeing anyone, we left. If the sandwich really had been ready and sitting there, it as well as the fries, would have been soggy. We would never have left Cross Lanes. Had they told us it was going to be over an hour and still not receive a simple sandwich we would have come back when they were better prepared.",

   "I'm going to go with the overall environment and conversations and food here. The environment is very chill. They have a dinning area, bar,  pool hall and gambling area. The employees are very welcoming and friendly. I ordered the Ruben and fried mushrooms. The Ruben was so fresh and enjoyable but the mushrooms tasted like they had freezer burn and then cooked. I couldn't eat them. I will soon visit again and do an update. \ud83d\ude42"

The owners and the chef have created that Italian homemade meal experience. Charleston\u2019s next top restaurant!!!",
   "As a former employee of Riatorante Abruzzi I can say that they are a very good resteraunt. The talent in the kitchen is unbelievable, they have some of the finest chefs I've ever met who truly put passion into their food and take pride in what they serve to customers. The wait staff is also very excellent, they have very friendly and well trained servers who will make sure your dining experience is as perfect as it can possibly be. On top of all of that they have very friendly owners who listen to customer feedback and ensure you thoroughly have a good experience.\n\n10/10 if you ever want to take your significant other out for a luxurious night or want to stop by for a well cooked meal this is the place for you."

My date loved hers so I'll go with her opinion since she loves sushi. The service was spot on with a attentive staff.",

   "Matt and Caleb are making the sushi with love!! The sushi is beautifully crafted and don't go in looking for cheap sushi rolls beacuse you won't fond it here! Totally worth it!",
   "This restaurant never fails to deliver! Every bite was on point from the appetizer to the salad to the entree to that lucious chocolate cake. Perfect way to celebrate an anniversary!!",
   "A great restaurant in the heart of downtown Charleston which offers cocktails from the classic Old Fashion and Manhattan to the uniquely asian-inspired green tea martini. The  is phenomenal and prepared by local legend, Chef Evan. From presentation to taste and texture, the sushi and sashimi are the highest quality and presented with culinary flair. Be warned that prices are above average, but understand that the restaurant uses the highest quality ingredients and the size of the restaurant limits the number of daily patrons. Our friends Julie and Keith were thoroughly impressed as well."

Everything I've tried is wonderful, and I've been all over the menu. Soups, original egg rolls, Rangoon, main dishes; it doesn't matter. You'll find each superior to similar dishes (but not exact) offered at the typical Chinese take out establishment. Unlike the typical, Chin's is unique, with recepies handed down along with a superb dedication to service. Go. Try anything ( and I HIGHLY recommend the Tahitian Chicken). Enjoy.",

Steak was cooked just right. Ribs were falling off the bone.  Crisp green leafy salad and a hot blooming onion. Server was exceptionally nice and was deserving of a good tip. Great experience. For a downtown restaurant, they do close early though for a weekend.",

   "Outback has gone so downhill.  My steak was overcooked and fatty.   My \"lobster tail\" was the size of a large shrimp and overcooked..  I used to love Outback but it has cut costs and become mediocre at best.  Service was fine though.  Bartender was very nice and helpful.   Not worth the  money at all anymore",
   "In the middle of a Whole30 while traveling.  Waitress was helpful and patient working with me to make sure my meal would be compliant.  Food was great too.",
   "Everything was prepared well as usual. I would not recommend the steak and shrimp version of the Queensland Pasta, as the cut of steak used is very chewy. If you do order it, eat the steak separately, rather than on the same fork as your pasta, otherwise you will end up needing to swallow pasta while still struggling with the chewy steak."

The homemade potato chips are a complete game changer that I'm still thinking about! This is a must stop place to visit in Charleston.",

The location is good if you\u2019re near, and parking is okay if you know what you\u2019re doing. Service is usually good depending on the times. Either way, food comes out hot and delicious.

   "Order appetizers. They can be large enough for one, and even if one eats two, you can get it for an excellent price. The prices are lower than one would expect for an upscale restaurant like itself. Once again, my best suggestion for keeping prices low is ordering appetizers and eating them as small plates or tapas. On another note, the desserts and cocktails are lovely. Great atmosphere- the tables are MASSIVE, and, you know, looking at a moonlit river is always beautiful.",
   "Absolutely Fantastic! The raw oysters for the appetizer were perfectly prepared with a citrus and shallot topping.  For the entree, I had the sea scallops.  They were super tender, crisp golden brown top and bottom served on a bed of risotto in a light creamy sauce.\n\nThe Bistro at the Barge is a great destination formal dinner.  It is a hidden gem, that you will have to really look closely at the signs to find.  The restaurant was recently reopened, after being closed for four years due to the owner passing away.  You can try to swing in and catch an open table, but reservations are a must for dinner.\n\nDuring the warmer months the lower level of the restaurant, Barge Restaurant Bar & Grill, is open for lunch and dinner, with river front seating right on the water.  \n\nThis is a restaurant with a rich history and some of the best food on the east coast.  Whether you stop in for riverside lunch in the summer or a 5-star worthy formal dinner year-round , you will not be disappointed.",
   "Outrageous prices, mediocre food, decent service. $117 for 6 of us to eat bar food and 3 beers. That's just too much to pay to sit on the river to eat bar food.",

   "Very good food and large portions for a reasonable price. The unique features and high ceiling make for a notable atmosphere and the staff are friendly and attentive. Been coming here for nearly a decade and admire the consistency of the food. Also, the manager is amazing and does his job very well.",
   "I had trouble finding a menu on internet so I have taken pictures for everyone else having the same trouble.  My visit was a early lunch dinner. \nThe waiter had a little  trouble understanding what I was asking . Which not a big deal at all.  \nPretty empty I must have hit a sweet spot because every other time I have had to wait forever even if it was lunch time. \nGreat service . Friendly staff . Cold drinks.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking for good Mexican food."

   "The service at Soho's was excellent! The staff is very friendly and the waiter's timing to stop by and check on our table was perfect. \n\nMy food review is based on a soup of the day crab bisque and the meatball sandwich. I personally didn't love the food, but I would return again to try something else.\n\nI grew up in Maryland, so I have a certain palette expectation for crab vegetable soup versus crab bisque. The crab bisque at Soho's was a combination of the two - a very heavy tomato sauce base without much cream or butter and I did not detect Old Bay. So as much as I enjoyed the soup, it felt lacking personally in the creaminess of a bisque.\n\nThe meatball sandwich has a beautiful presentation, but I had to squish the meatballs down to even attempt to eat it as a sandwich. The meatballs really should be smaller with more of them. The meatballs themselves had a texture that was super smooth and I personally prefer a but more mouthfeel to meatballs. The sauce was excellent. The bread was crusty and delicious, but hard to enjoy because of the overly sized meatballs. The cheese was fine, but should have been melted because it did not pull apart easily.\n\nI wish the side was not chips. The chips held too much oil in them though they were crunchy. \n\nAgain, I would return to try something else on the menu because the food was pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend this particular sandwich.",
   "Great service,  great food... the vegetarian lasagna is my favorite... so tasty and unusual!  Great atmosphere too.",
   "Almost heaven :) the food is very good and the atmosphere is also nice. Nevertheless, the prices are a bit more on the upper side and reduce the accessibility to the masses. We loved every bite, bit it was still slightly overpriced",
   "A nice restaurant, a little rustic with a modern twist I would say. I've only had good meals here, their alfredo sauce is amazing. Save room for tremendous desserts.",
   "Excellent food! Nice setting, comfortable seating. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Menu choices were varied and interesting and priced as expected for the area."

They have giant checkers to play, a big fireplace thats amazing especially in the winter, and is just a comfortable place to eat. Their food is amazing in my opinion. My mother loves their chicken livers and the cheese casserole. Definitely give it a try. Also, the gift shop is amazing and unique. Older/replica antique things, toys, clothes, soaps and lotions, candy and sodas, and a lot of things you dont really see anywhere else. A little expensive in the gift shop, but very nice. I could spend a lot of money there. I wish they had the candy \"Brown Cows\" again. Great place to go and take your family for a nice country meal. I love it and highly recommend. Keep up the great work!",
   "Very good food. Grilled chicken was very delicious and could be cut with a fork. Baked sweet potato was excellent, the skin peeled off very well and did not have any of the sweet potato stuck to the skin. I asked for the brown sugar and butter to be placed on the side, since I was not sure I wanted the butter or brown sugar. Steamed broccoli was good as well. The salad was delicious and fresh. The server was friendly and attentive."

   "Great atmosphere is the first thing that hits you when you walk in. Not sure what it previously was but they have left most of the original look and it's really nice. My server, Sid, was awesome and we talked quite a bit while I was there at the bar. I got the Patty Melt burger and it was delicious. Cooked just right and that marble rye made everything else pop. The menu all looked delicious and I can't wait to go back to try more. Parking was a little sad since it's mainly street parking with meters, unless there's a free lot I didn't see nearby. Overall I would highly recommend it.",
   "Atmosphere is really cool and unique with all of the paintings everywhere. The food was really good! I liked that they decorate the tables with paper and have crayons to doodle while you wait. Fun place! Also impressed that the waitress wyrite her name upside down.",
   "Gonzo burger is a wonderful dining experience: Delicious food, rare beer selection, super clean, the staff are excellent, and the art pieces in the restaurant that you can also buy are beautiful. If you are ever in Charleston, WV I highly recommend you check it out!!!",
   "Second time here. Would have been 5 starts but the service was a little slow but not horribly  slow and my wife\u2019s burger a little undercooked but again not horribly. Great atmosphere, parking is scarce so bring quarters for the meter. Food is really good, they blend their own burger in House we was told and it shows in the taste of the burger. Beer selection is above average and the soda comes in bottles, which I find a little weird but I\u2019m sure they have a reason. Second time visiting and will be back. They sometime have live music which is really nice. Happy hour 4pm-6pm. Prices vary 10-13$ for a burger. Building is a historical building, so if you appreciate the architecture of old buildings and a good burger give it a try!"

It took 45 minutes to seat us, 15 to get a server, another 15 for drinks, and then got our chef an hour later. However, the food was delectable, and the staff incredibly friendly. Hopefully they get some issues sorted improve!",
