   "We love the Discovery Center! It's a wonderful place for the kids to run around and burn energy, but also filled with educational activities. Keep your eyes open for awesome programming that the staff put on. The hours a little bit shortened in the winter, so if you're unable to make it now, rest assured summer hours are coming!",
   "This place is huge and really neat for kids to explore. There are so many things to do. My kids loved being in a giant bubble and also playing in the house and figuring out how to use the \"house phones\". We will definitely have to come back next time.",
   "Excellent place for kids. Lots of fun things for kids to do & look at. All age group activities for children. Kids will thank you for the fun.",
   "Such a fun place for children AND adults! Everyone is so nice!!",
   "Nice place with kids activities. The staff was friendly and they have some fun learning things to do!"

   "A great little museum to visit if you are visiting Pierre.  It might be recommended for nonresidents to set map directions as it isn't necessarily located in a popular area of travel. \n\nA great place for people like myself  who enjoy military history and continual learning. I personally enjoyed our visit,  despite not all our children being as excited as I was. Unfortunately generational differences don't necessarily allow this place to be as enjoyable for teenagers. It is definitely recommended for younger children as my grandsons had a wonderful time."

   "My experience here was quite good. My mate and I rolled up in our car and parked just a block away with no issues, and unlike many of the other state capitol buildings I have visited, this had no security checks, at least coming through the door we did. All of the rooms were pretty accessible, including the State Affairs room where I testified. The setting was very nice on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River, and the ponds around it looked very cool. I might not visit again to testify, but I am glad I did the one time. It\u2019s close in resemblance to the Montana State capitol because the same design was used, interestingly enough. If you\u2019re passing through, it\u2019s worth even a quick visit.",
   "It\u2019s a decent state building though there isn\u2019t much to see for tourists besides a few displays on the little history about the building itself and some pictures of the state officials. I wish it would show more culture, politics, and history stuff relating to the state of South Dakota.",
   "Great place. Pierre is such a quiet and simple city. When we visited here the Capitol dome was under repair work. But the experience of being there was superb enough to make us happy. We walked in the nearby areas and took some pictures. The nearby areas are also quiet and not too much traffic and activity there. We liked the atmosphere and our visit to this great location. There\u2019s a church nearby and right in front of the capitol there is a Soldiers and Sailors World War Memorial Building.",
   "Interesting place to wander through, with plenty of artistic and architectural details.  The evening I visited there was a music recital that added to the enjoyment.",
   "Nice building to visit.  We didn't get to spend a lot of time as we were on our way to Rapid City.  We did get the boys capitol books stamped but almost had to run to another location (luckily found someone willing to go behind the desk and get the stamp."

If you want to really see or experience it , visit the Ft Pierre Nat'l Grasslands Center in Ft Pierre, get a map and advice. During the spring you can reserve a blind to watch and photograph Sharp Tail Grouse. The best thing about the Grasslands is that it is not full of public convences - nor should it be. I have enjoyed this land that was made for skies, and that you can get far enough away from modern life to hear nature unadulterated. Other wildlife seen here are the Pronghorn, deer, butterflies, various hawks, meadowlarks  and snakes- incl rattlesnakes. If you explore in the summer dress correctly and bring plenty of water.",

   "We drove through the campus of St. Joseph's Indian School in Chamberlain and decided to make a quick stop at the Lakota Museum. It turned out to be not so quick. Way more than we expected. A high quality museum with a lot of excellent history of the Lakota Sioux. It also includes a nice summery of St. Joseph's School with many historic photographs. It has an excellent gift shop and the young ladies working in the gift shop were friendly and helpful. The museum is not large so an hour would work but if you have more time and are interested in history this would be a good place to target. A beautiful setting on the Missouri river.",
   "Quite small, but an excellent museum. Clean and clear ehxibit. Plenty of nice souvenirs to remember the history of the Great Plains people. If you're passing nearby it worth the stop to visit it. If , like us, you are in a family vacation trip across the Plains, it is worth too. Those who have read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee will be specially pleased.",
   "On our way to the Badlands/Black Hills we enjoyed stopping at Chamberlain to see the view of the Missouri River from the Visitor Center.   Fortunately, we made time on our way back to stop at this lovely museum.  The museum is a beautiful building right on the river in town.  There is a friendly staff and the exhibits were very well done.  For families this should be a must see on the way to other sites in South Dakota - especially for families who are trying to help their children understand the history of this area.   While Mount Rushmore is a destination for many, this museum helps provide some balance.  Thank you for investing your time and money in educating people about our past.",
   "So honored to be able to go to a unique place. Learning history that mainstream Education system didn't teach you in schools.  The medicine wheel courtyard was so peaceful.  So many beautiful works of art from former students of the school. So much to take in that one visit is not enough.",
   "Every South Dakota school child should be required to visit here; as well as every adult!  I learned SO much.  Very detailed exhibits and notations on early Native American Life, culture.  Lots of authentic items, donated & identified.  There is a very large bookstore, souvenir shop; with something or everyone.  I spent 2 1/2 hrs here.  Native staff who work here are a wonderful source of current & historical information on our native Americans."

   "Couldn't find anything to complain about. They weren't very busy when we were there (late August) so it was very peacefull. We were late getting there and thought we were to late to get some firewood but the host drove through about 9 and went and got us some.\n\nThe only thing some might have problems with is that if you have ATT, you will have 0 signal. That was ok with us because we were looking to get off the grid for a bit.\n\nVery nice and relaxing stay! Will go again!"

This is also part of the beauty as you can touch, walk into the natural areas. Some decent places to stop and eat, buy trinkets and piddle. Decently clean in most places.",

   "I arrived at the Badlands relatively late in the day, around 8:00pm or even later. It was the middle of the summer, and we got out of our car just in time to see one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. We proceeded to drive through the park until dark, and from what I witnessed, the badlands looks like an amazing place to visit during the day time, especially if one has more than an hour as they are passing through.",
   "We visited in winter and with the slight snow dusting this landscape was astonishing. Would recommend anyone to visit it. The visitor center is great and has friendly and informative staff.",
   "Amazing scenery and drives inside and outside this jewel of a park. Colors in the hills are unique and amazing. I am planning on going back, there was not enough time to see everything. But I did go to Wall Drug. I suggest stopping there at least once in your life."

The history and the deeper meanings were shared. And the origin story of the creation was really great.",

We rented one of their cabins, no complaints would be ideal if some were pet friendly.  Very easy drive into Deadwood for an afternoon of eating, drinking and checking out the sights.  Looking forward to another visit to spend more time so we can see all of this magnificent park. Good facilities, sites are well proportioned, Rangers very helpful and easy to find.",
   "We truly enjoyed Custer Park. We got there around 10 am and found it hard to see much of the wildlife around that time, so best to probably go earlier as others recommend. We were lucky enough to see some buffalo closer towards her end but overall there were some very nice views. The folks at the visitor center were extremely helpful and truly provided great recommendations. We were aiming to go from Custer park to Crazy Horse and then Mt. Rushmore however were advised to take a different route and it was worth it. We got to see Mt. Rushmore as we were going though a tunnel. Recommend doing a visit.",
   "Not what you would expect for a leisurely afternoon drive.  The park has more to offer than buffalo and open plains. Quaint camping lodging tucked away around one bend. Gentle babbling brooks around the next bend.  Wild donkeys greet you at the next turn. And buffalo are virtually everywhere.  \nDon\u2019t speed through this one. \nTake your time and really take in this place. \nIt\u2019s still a land lost in the late 1800\u2019s and you can feel the history.  \nHighly recommended this visit. \nOn a last high note. The cost for the park was super reasonable for a day trip",
   "Beautiful area. Driving the switchback narrow roads around the Needles formations is worth the price of admission itself. Sylvan lake is amazing and we also did a few trails around the area. All are great but we really enjoy the hike up Little Devil's Tower mountain. Fun trail with lots of raspberry bushes along most of it. Last half mile is exposed with a little bit of non technical rock climbing at the end makes it a fun adventure.",

   "Very peaceful campground near the Missouri River. East campground has paved parking pass and clean shower house/bathrooms. Hiking trails, boat ramp, beach, and playground close to the camp sites. West campground has gravel pads and some seem steep. Great spot to relax for a few days. Did notice planes flying over often, perhaps from Sioux Falls to Denver?",
   "This is probably one of my favorite sites that i've stayed in so far. We had a site right next to the Missouri river with views to die for. The water was less than 10 feet away. The view was incredible, also, no mosquitos ! For the first time in a long time we could actually enjoy an evening outside without using bug spray. (Been road tripping on the east coast) I would say that this site is definitely more of an RV site than it is for tent/van campers, there's loads of outdoor sports like jet skiing and whatnot that go on around and it seems to be a popular spot for the local residents and families in the area. They had great showers and amenities which made it a nice stay and the campsite was generally really nice. Would recommend it for the views. The only negative aspect was that we were charged a fee to enter the state park on top of the camp fee which was a bit steep, and weren't aware of this fee till after we arrived. Seems to be geared more to people who would go to the park often or the state parks often. Other than that it's a lovely campsite and i enjoyed my stay there.",
   "Loved our stay and will visit frequently.",
   "One of our favorite parks, two camp grounds to camp in. Kept up well, sites and comfort stations always clean. What a view, beautiful tree packed bluffs on the west side of the river. Lots of water, the river is about a mile wide and 65' deep.",

I believe the upkeep comes from donations so entry into the park is free! Just a short drive within the park area is entertainment such as miniature golf and go karts for a price. Both offered great fun as I was there with other adults. Definitely would return next time if I'm ever in Aberdeen, SD.",

Lots to do with the family or as a larger group!",

   "We took a family of nine (aged 13 - 75) here on a Tuesday and had a great time. The open aviary and the crocodile and alligator enclosures were the best part of the establishment in my opinion. We also had the good fortune to watch a snake show, and then later a bird show (hawk, eagle, owls)-both were well presented well and interesting. There are A LOT of snakes here!oh yes: there are also some Galapagos tortoises, one is 115 years old. Nice place!",
   "Great place to visit if you are into the slithery sort. It's awesome that they give a military discount and parking is always plentiful. Being able to get a season pass from March to November is great. The handlers are entertaining. Make sure you visit during the summer season so you can catch the gator shows.",
   "They will convert your ticket into a season pass for free! The grounds are an easy walk, plenty of opportunities to sit and relax and enjoy the scenery. The reptiles, birds, exotic plants, arachnids and prairie dogs are plentiful and interesting. Playground equipment for littles and gardens for elders. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful. Wonderful way to spend time.",
   "This place was amazing! Every species there was in such great health, it was just a really great experience! They were all very friendly and made the experience very unique! The bird show was incredible! I won't say anything more than that, because I feel that you should experience it yourself if you have the chance! I will return some day!",
   "Lots of really cool animals to look at. It's has more than just reptiles. The gift shop is really neat too. Defitely recommend."

   "We decided to stop here after visiting Mount Rushmore and didn't know what to expect. I have to say that we were all surprised and just how amazing this place was. We stopped at a gas station and cleaned all the car windows and enjoyed every minute of the drive through Bear Country. The animals get so close to the cars and it's so cool to see them in a more natural environment. There were so many bears to look at, we could've sat in the car all day watching them. Definitely recommend this place!",
   "One of the highlights of visiting WY \u2013 dare I say it but it was more impressive and fun than Mount Rushmore!  It is an 11 mile nature preserve that allows you to drive through an assortment of wildlife that will include bears, wolves, mountain goats, etc.  At the end you can leave the car walk through exhibits that more closely resemble a typical zoo.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting!",
   "Me and my family loved it. The kids enjoyed getting to see the animals walk around close to the vehicle. Kind of a bummer that we couldn't see the wolf or the big cats because they were sleeping. All in all a good experience. Also enjoyed the walk at the end where your able to see even more animals. Definitely worth the money.",
   "Preponderance of bears roaming. Quite fun. Mountain lions didn't have enough space. Real reindeer herd was cool. Mountain goats and bighorn sheep wandering freely were nice to see. Arctic wolves didn't appear to have much roaming room.",
   "This is a must see attraction for anyone visiting the Black Hills.  A drive through experience with bears and a dozen or so other species of wild life; a walk around area for some up close views of bear cubs and other smaller animals; and the obligatory gift shop that isn't too ridiculously overpriced.  I grew up in the Black Hills and we go back every year or two to visit family and this is one stop that is still a must every time we go back."

   "It's a inexpensive good time to take your little people and bring back the wonders of your childhood. I've been bringing my kids there now I bring my grandchildren there. And we all love it.",
   "Hours of fun.  Storybook Land is a unique park with tons of interactive figures from your favorite childhood storybook.  Everything is very well kept and they have even added several new attractions since we were here several years ago.  This park is free except for the rides but even those are not to expensive.   Kids got to see figures like Jack and the Bean stalk, Cinderella, Wizard of Oz, Black Stallion, Old McDonald, Winnie the Pooh, 3 Little Pigs and so many more.  They even have a small wild animal exhibit, bike trails and a small train ride that take you around the park.  The train and the newer roller coaster was a favorite for the kids.  Well worth your time!",

   "A friend of my wife's had told her about the Corn Palace and since we were driving right past Mitchell we decided to stop by. We expected it to be close to the interstate, which it is not, little did we know that it was here long before anyone had imagined an interstate highway system. It is probably a couple of miles from the highway but there are plenty of signs and it is not hard to find. Parking was also easy with free parking lots within easy walking distance - a couple of blocks. Inside it was a little wacky, a little educational, a lot of history and all very interesting. The people working were friendly and helpful. There was an excellent gift shop and really nice restrooms. Absolutely worth the stop...",
   "The corn palace was everything you needed it to be and nothing you expected. Beautiful murals, that change yearly, made of corn all over the exterior of the palace. Easily spotted with the decorative turrets atop the place. Also home to a rather large basketball arena, the place is genuinely surprising. Across the street you will find the gift shop which honestly is just as enjoyable as the palace itself, definitely a pit stop you should make!",
   "It was so neat!!! The best part was that it was PET FRIENDLY!!! What other place gives you a stop on a long journey and allows your four legged family inside?! We really enjoyed stopping by. You don\u2019t need a long time there but it\u2019s definitely neat to see and support local history spots. After all.l, it\u2019s the world\u2019s only corn palace!!!",
   "We go to watch Dakota Wesleyan's basketball teams. Very nice venue. Most of the parents and faculty sit on the east side which has bleachers but there are padded seats on the west side they're often filled as well. Local groups to halftime entertainment. There's a good snack bar & plenty of bathrooms. The only bad thing is that parking can be an issue. You often have to walk a block or two.",
   "A must stop if you are on highway I90 going by Mitchell. Detail of corn on outside of building is amazing. Inside has merchandise you can buy. A few minutes of off the highway but worth the 5 minute drive."

Jump into the cockpit of a bomber and feel like you are there at 30,000 ft.  And then slide into the flight simulator and pilot a jet from takeoff to landing ( if you got the \u201cRight Stuff\u201d). \nWe were lucky to be outside when the air wing was coming in for landing.  What a wonderful sight to behold.  \n\nGreat site to visit for all ages.    And wonderful gift shop with amazing take home items.  \nAdd this to your list",

   "Very interesting things to read about. There was a pilot named Clyde Ice and among many things he was a flight instructor. The interesting part is how he was the flight instructor for other aviators that went on to do something significant in aviation. He is mentioned in a few other bios and in the video that is shared there. Plus they got cool planes."

   "My family thought I was nuts, but I had to do it. I remember Wall Drug billboards as a kid in the late 50s and early 60s - from hundreds of miles away, they'd give \"distance to Wall Drug\". What is it? A tourist trap and one of the greatest marketing campaigns ever.\n\nBut seriously, it's much fun to visit. The homemade donuts are to die for. The restaurant is reasonably priced and the food is very good. After that - shop. It actually is a great place to pick up tourist stuff, gifts, etc. And it's a real piece of Americana.\n\nWe were on the way to Black Hills and heading into Badlands. It was ever so slightly out of our way and worth the stop. Family still thinks I'm nuts, but they had fun",
   "We enjoined seeing all of the signs as we drove across the state. It was a interesting rest stop on our road trip to Yellowstone from Dunbar PA.\nThere was a lot to see here. The food here looked very good but it was so busy and we didn't have the time to wait that long to eat.\nBut we did find several souvenirs to take home and we got our Free Ice Water.....\nWe'll stop again someday when we have more time  and look it over a lot better....",
   "Wall drug is a must stop if you are traveling through  South Dakota in the I90. You cant miss it with all the billboards they have filled through the highway. They still have the free ice water and cheap coffee tradition, the food was considerably good. And the badlands national park is very closely as well.",
   "Honestly not that impressed. If you want to look around in the shops then it\u2019s a good idea. They have some very interesting shops but there are just so many people and their \u201cfamous water\u201d is warm and disgusting. I wish I could rate it higher but it just wasn\u2019t interesting for my whole family.",
   "All those billboards on the road make you expect something special. It\u2019s more like an ordinary tourist attraction full of different staff. Its Wild West theme is quite interesting. It\u2019s the only place to eat in the area but it definitely is overestimated."

What a nice waterway with an old train track overhead and planes landing a few miles away.  Add the historic old brick mills and sound of the water flow and a nice view of the falls.  Could spend an hour there walking up/down the river walkways.",
   "Was so cold when we went! But, the view of the falls was really pretty and only a short walk from the parking lot. Plus, there was no fee to enter so definitely worth the visit if you're in the area. The Cafe was closed for the season, so can't speak for that. Will try to upload some pics once I get them from my camera, but there are plenty of pics that others posted that pretty much sum it up view wise.",
   "It's a great park to walk through and has lots of places you can sit to enjoy the scenery. During Christmas they set up festive lights, so it's always nice to come see that.\nThe overlook tower is really fun to go up on because you get a really good view of downtown Sioux Falls. \nThe only thing that can be a little off-putting is that the water/falls are very green. It would be really cool if the city could find a solution to purify the water. I realize this wouldn't be an easy or cheap thing to do, but it would definitely brighten up the park!",
   "Nice to visit. Great picnic spot and trails to walk, run and bike. Can smell fishy sometimes and no railings which can make it dangerous if you dont use discretion. Natures beauty and normally pretty popular with locals and tourists so people are around. Neat landmark in Sioux Falls. The light show/history of the falls is a must.",
   "Falls park at around the holidays is truly spectacular.  You can drive around or stop to walk around. All of the lights was amazing and they are enjoyed by young and old alike. Definitely worth a trip."

I am a regular here and have had numerous wildlife experiences that were beyond description. If you have the ability to go for a hike. you will likely be rewarded big time.",
   "Elevator broke back in July 2019 and the park superintendent estimated a month for repairs. It's now February 2020 (8 months) and there's no update. For a park whose sole attraction is a cave, it's absurd to not be able to enter the cave.",
   "We still enjoyed learning about the area and it's history.  At times it seemed too close even though we were in our van or at a safe distance. Inside the cave is quite interesting if you have never been in a cave before, but even regular cave dwellers will probably find this cave intriguing. But the elevator still isn't working; it's a bummer not to be able to enter the cave. The elevator was not working when we were there, so there were no cave tours at all. I don't know what I was expecting when we were offered a tour of the largest natural opening, but I was a bit surprised.",

This place has beyond amazing mountain views, especially of Pike's Peak. The building is very clean, and well updated. The Discovery tour was $23 for adults, $17 for kids older than 6, and well worth it. Learned a lot, and enjoyed the cave. Gift shop is really good, hard not to spend a lot of $ here. I wanted to do the Terror-Dactyl ride, but it was $50 and they didn't allow any glasses/sunglasses, and I didn't have my contacts in. I will come back next time I am in CO Springs. Awesome place!

   "Our family had an incredible time here! The historic interpreters were so engaging with my daughters, there were more things to see than we had time for, and everything we saw had such a sweet balance of the story of the books and the real life history of the time and place. I really hope we get to visit again!",
   "Very fun place to visit. They have a great setup with many hands-on things to do. We spent over 4 hours here but it only felt like 1 because the kids had so much fun. All of the staff were really friendly.",
   "I was surprised at how much I remembered from the books as we toured the place.  The historic actors with the information were wonderful. The place is well maintained and a long over due visit.",
   "Such a beautiful place!! For the best experience, we suggest to plan ahead to stay on the prairie in a real wagon or the bunkhouse. Our kids loved it!! Even our teenagers found FUN on the farm! The workers were so kind and helpful and really engaging and knowledgeable. The shower houses weren\u2019t far away and they were clean and water was warm. Family ran and they were super sweet!! Highly recommend!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
   "One of our top favorite places in all of SD. Every trip is a different experience. We always spend all day and our 6 year old never gets bored. The owners are so personable. You'll want to come back every year."

My husband and I were the only ones in the tour so it felt very personable. I would definitely recommend the cave tour. Many parts were absolutely stunning and you are able to get amazing pictures.",

He even chatted with our kids as we walked through the cave, which was welcomed for my wife and I, so we could focus on our younger son navigating all the steps without touching the cave walls. We were very impressed and found it to be well worth the money spent. Our kids were so excited after they left the cave, and they said they had made a new friend.",
   "Our tour guide Kevin did an amazing job, it was a blast for young and old alike! He had an excellent sense of humor and was very knowledgeable about the cave. Pricing was acceptable, but we opted not to go on any rides due to time limitations.",
   "The lady friend and I both did the 1 hour cave tour with Kevin and loved it. He was very entertaining and knowledgeable. \n\nThe lady friend did the rollercoaster and had a blast on it. \n\nWould definitely come back here again."

   "This was one of our most favorite stops on our road trip vacation. It was awesome seeing the tower in the distance as you drive towards it.\nAnd as you get there it was way better in person than any picture we've ever seen of it.\nI highly recommend taking the time and walk around the entire perimeter on the tower. Al of the different views are worth the walk.\nThis will definitely be on our list to return to someday...",
   "I don't feel this place can be accurately described in words. Much like the grand canyon, you have to see this with your own eyes to truly appreciate what an amazing monument it is. I visited as a teenager and years later brought my family to visit. Hopefully I'll get to visit again one day.\nWe hiked around it, took a bunch of pictures, watched the wildlife around and just enjoyed the spectacular view of this towering mass of rock and the beautiful surrounding country.",
   "This was a beautiful stop on a road trip I took in the summer. The walk around the monument was fun and there are lots of places to take photos. The washrooms at the park were clean and maintained. Definitely would stop again in the future. Using the tower viewers to try and find the old wooden stairs was incredibly fun as well.",
   "Can't describe how awesome this National Monument is! Have to see it in person to fully understand how this formed. Beautiful park with easy walking trail around monument. Visitors center describes how this formed (or what they all agree upon). Worth the drive!",
   "Really great national park. We did the long loop and it was just gorgeous! The views were awesome. The only downside was we weren\u2019t allowed to take our golden retriever puppies on the hike. Unfortunately, because people don\u2019t clean up after their little furry friends, most national parks don\u2019t allow pets. But still take the time to visit this national park. It will be worth your time."

Very pleasant staff.\nMuseum area is one stop viewing of all things Native American.\nScale plaster model outside is good reference and to take pictures in front of.",
   "Very interesting finally seeing it for the first time in real life. I've seen many pictures and videos over the years. But being there is a completely different experience.\nI hope I'm still around to see it completed someday. \nIt's worth the trip to go and see...",
   "Very informative, recommend to check out the the documentary in the theatre in the visitors center. The carving itself is not complete yet but they are making progress. The progress is very slow and we understand why it is that after watching the documentary. Good lesson on American history. Its worth going here of you are going to Mt Rushmore",
   "This was a really eye opening experience. Crazy horse memorial has a really inspiring story behind it. You have to watch the film inside the museum in order to understand everything behind crazy horse. Also be sure to take a ride in the bus that takes you to the base of the mountain. It was a pleasant experience. I would recommend this to anyone.",
   "If you can go there. Please do. They are privately funded by donations. No help from the government at all. A family legacy in the making. An amazing place to be with family. The lazer light show is beautiful. It is more of a museum so not so much hands on for kids. But the performances are amazing and kids will love it. Staff are loving and visit with guests a lot. One of the best places to go."

   "It was a dream come true for me!! It was the 50 anniversary - my grandmother came Norway I had heard stories and seen pictures of chapels in Norway.  It is something I will carry with me forever.  If you have Norwegian heredity it is a must place you must see.  The beauty the reverence of what truly God is.",
   "The Chapel in the Hills is absolutely beautiful! I've loved it since the first time I visited, and I've dreamed of having my wedding at the Chapel. However, I was extremely disappointed to find out that just recently in late 2019, the Chapel changed their policy so couples MUST use their Lutheran pastors to officiate weddings at the chapel. While I understand that they have the freedom to hold this rule, it's very disappointing, especially since this is a newly implemented policy. I'll continue to visit and admire the Chapel in the Hills, but am very disappointed in this recent change of policy.",

The prices aren\u2019t as bad as some have said, it\u2019s 2019 and this type of equipment is expensive to fix, I\u2019m a pipefitter By trade, so I would know.

There is also an incredible display of minerals, meteorites, and fluorescent minerals. The gift shop is reasonably prices too. My pictures are just a SMALL FRACTION of what\u2019s there and don\u2019t include any of the large fossils or meteorites. I arrived too late in the day this particular visit to take as many photos as I wanted; it\u2019s easy to spend several hours there (and I have!).",
   "This museum is awesome! It takes up the 3rd floor of an academic building but is well-labeled with visitor parking out front. The exhibits are very well labeled and organized, with one area containing rocks/minerals and the other area containing fossils. I appreciated the old-school feel of the museum, with the displays being more informative than flashy. They have a great variety of fossils, with some common and some rare (but all exciting). The best part, the museum is free (but appreciates donations). Well worth the stop, looking forward to visiting again someday!",
   "I loved my visit here! I really like how they have the minerals organized. There's even an area to keep younger kids occupied. Lots of great fossils too, but personally I am more of a rock-hound. The fluorescent display is really cool.",
   "This is a great, free place to go for a little education!  There weren't many interactive things for kids to do throughout the museum except for a few things in the kids area, but the front desk has a scavenger hunt for kids that takes them all over the museum.  The labeling on each case could be a little better to make the scavenger hunt flow a bit better, but the kids get to pick a rock at the end which was super fun!!  A great place for homeschoolers too!!",
   "Lots of great exhibits that you can experience up close. Plus it's FREE! The kids loved seeing a variety of fossils and minerals. Check for parking right in front of the building after the busy hours"

It's totally free to go, and the store had some really great stuff that we haven't found anywhere else.\n\nIt was such a hit that we ended up going twice, first at the start of our trip and then again almost a week later when we were leaving.\n\nIf you're in the area and have a dinosaur fan, it's really worth the trip. The dinos are around 90 years old if memory serves and some could use a little more paint, but it doesn't detract from the experience.",

   "I went for dinner with a friend. I had been for lunch and dinner was just as good. From the house salad to egg plant parmagan it was excellent. Servive was amazing. A friendly family restaurant with an open kitchen. The table with next to us had a great pizza. A place to go back to and try different menu items.",
   "Went to La Minestra for the first time today... Greeted at the entrance with a friendly hello.. We arrived when they first opened for lunch.  Nicely furnished and decorated, including the floors.  The staff was super friendly and ready to go into detailed description of the menu items. The menu is small, but adequate.  We ordered two of the lunch specials.  I ordered the chicken tortellini/ sun-dried tomatoes/ spinach with a cream sauce and a 1/2 Ceasars salad... My husband ordered the clam chowder soup with a turkey wrap.. Both meals were great... He loved the clam chowder.  We both sampled all of the food.  My only negatives were.. The sauce on the tortellini was some what runny. Also, the romaine lettuce was not in small enough pieces.. Its hard to cut it yourself without having it all over the table and you. The clam chowder was thick, the the sauce on the tortellini should of been too... The tortellini tasted very good though.  We would definitely go back.. Expect to pay about $15 or more with a drink and tip.   Upbeat place with good food and a happy staff!",
   "I like this place because it has a flavor distinct from the rest of the food in Pierre. I've only eaten their lunch specials, which change daily.\n\nTheir newer happy hour menu is great. Nice selection and reasonably priced. I appreciate the smaller portions and $2 price tag, so I can order a variety.\n\nWait staff is consistently on point, friendly, quick, and apologetic if something doesn't go right. ",
   "Service and food were perfect tonight. Could go a little lighter on the rosemary on the truffle fries, but everything else was perfect. The mussles over linguine needs to be on the menu!! So good!!!",
   "Neat little place, you wont find spaghetti here but lots of other great entrees.   Staff is friendly and prompt.  Prices are reasonable."

   "Don't bother.\nThe salsa has no tomato chunks. It is cilantro and onion soup with a watery tomato base.\n\nThe pollo fundido is bland (but pretty moist) chicken wrapped in a tortilla (either fried or not) and then they have the audacity to slap a slice of processed american cheese on top of each one. Even after I smothered it in sour creme I couldn't suffer through it.\n\nThe chili verde is a green onion and tough cubes of pork smothered in....something. even the rice here needs hot sauce to have flavor.\n\nOh and they have nothing on draft.",

All of them were a little above average on the Chinese quality scale. The staff was very helpful and kind. The price of all of them items were slightly higher than they should be.",

On weekdays there are two featured lunch specials of home-made deliciousness, ranging from soups to sandwiches to meatloaf to hot beef with mashed potatoes. The specials change every day and often depend on what's in season.

   "Gators Pizza is located inside the center of the mall in Pierre.  They have a large variety of food to choose from and are full of flavor.  Even during peak times of service; food output was incredibly fast without sacrifice of quality.  To see the owner interacting with customers is a pleasant twist to see in this day and age; I wish I saw this more often in other restaurants.  The area is filled with a good positive and energetic energy and I can see that the employees enjoy what they do here.  Location is very clean and table clean up during peak times is also fast.  They have SD video lottery in the back and they also sell beer here.  Prices are pretty fair for the quality of the food you get; for a large 3 topping pizza, 2 monsters, and breadsticks cost around $30.  If you are in Pierre and want some good pizza, salads, and soups; check this place out.",
   "The food is always good. I do find it to be over priced for its value. I do like the variety of menu options.",
   "Allowing 36 people in your restaurant is irresponsible!! Pierre ordinance says you can only have 10z  It last on surfaces for 10 days and what about your bathrooms. I don\u2019t belive those CDC guidelines. You will spread it all around Pierrre.",

   "Roughly only took a half hour from the point of walking in the door to being done with my meal. Probably one of the better places in Pierre to eat in my opinion. Honestly it was a little bit of a struggle finding gluten free options at first, since their isn\u2019t a separate menu you have to ask or be knowledge about the rolls and how they are different here. But the staff work with you and now that they\u2019ve all dealt with it they navigate your options easier now. But the food is taste, the service is super strong as everyone will check in with you and how your meal is going, and the options are varied. I suggest the steak hibachi if you aren\u2019t a sushi person.",
   "I came here on opening day fully expecting it to be a disaster. Much to my surprise, everything was running smoothly and efficiently. I ordered 3 rolls to go, it was buy 2 get 1 free. I was provided hot tea while I waited which was delicious and such a pleasant surprise. It took about 20 minutes for the rolls, but they were all amazing and definitely worth the wait. I grabbed a menu so I can call ahead next time. The dining room is clean and open, and there is a sushi bar to sit at as well. Staff was super friendly and inviting and I can't wait to go back. Excellent addition to our community!"

Great place to hang out and have drinks and good food. When we get back to normal, it\u2019ll be the first place I go.",
   "Great food, the Nachos and Wings were the best I've had in a long time.   Only beat by a Dive Bar in the middle of Alaska.   Coming from the Washington DC area where dive bars and greasy spoons can be found almost every a corner.   They don't even  compare to this food.",
   "So it\u2019s a dive bar and the atmosphere is pretty much what you\u2019d expect. The salad bar could use a better eye to what your staff puts out. Lettuce that\u2019s really bruised and starting to go bad shouldn\u2019t be put out.... or intentionally buried at the bottom. The bathrooms need a complete overhaul. The floor is uneven and the in the stalls there is tile missing.... which shows exposed the exposed wall and the water damage there. \n\nReally my only good thing to say about Jake\u2019s is the wait staff. Super polite and good about keeping your drinks full and your order needs taken care of. \n\nThat being said the food could use a lifesaver. I went a few times and the pork riblet basket was a lot more sad that I was expecting? When I got the ribs it was a 50/50 split between good and horrible. One side was  so over done and crispy that it crunched worse than popcorn would? The other have was actually really good and done to a nice level..... just don\u2019t know how you can have such polar opposites in one side of ribs...",
   "Consistently good food and service.  Standard pub fare.  I recommend the Reuben.",
   "Got sat down and got served by a cranky waitress. Had to confirm our order twice. The food came out quick but was disappointing. \nOrdered the taco salad. \nTortilla was stale. Meat was poorly seasoned. Used an old tasting mixed salad for the lettuce. Poorly chopped. The tomatoes were under ripe.  \nWaitress never came back to check on us. \nCountry radio station playing in the background with commercials and all.\nOverall the place looks dated and worn down. Kind of a shame for a Pierre staple.\nThe riblets were decent."

   "For a restaurant so say they have good food and they show it. This is not that restaurant. I will say I'm very disappointed in this place. My little brother and I ate here maybe a month ago, I'm not going back.\nI ordered the shrimp fajitas, little brother ordered nachos. His nachos were great. Mine not to much, the shrimp was warm to the point of cold, my peppers were under cooked and the over all dish had no flavor, salt and pepper never killed anyone. Oh did I mention that everything came out in under 5 minutes. That's scary! In the end we ordered a fried icecream. Maybe I'm not used to the way they do it here but it was fried than frozen, came out also in under 5 minutes.\n\nHaving to lie on my way out the door while I had a sick stomach was not fun, I dont like to be rude. I have sat on this for a month, mad that I had to lie, mad that I got sick, and mad the food was made poorly",
   "This is for a visit back in August. Very delicious and authentic. Really liked the mole sauce. I'm docking two stars though because the owner wasn't too friendly to us. I feel like when you own a restaurant you should be a little more welcoming to patrons."

   "Housemade items are simply amazing! Staff is extremely efficient, honest, and exhibits the quality of a real team. Best of all, they have the best views of the upper midwest. Prices are so reasonable for all the amenities- it makes Drifters a worthwhile destination of it's own. If only there was a rating higher than 5 stars. \n\nReview of our delightful menu items. The Beet hummus is fresh and delightful. Quite enjoyable for the novice and expert veggie eater. The burger?!? Beyond amazing. However the fries seem to be hand cut and so extremely fresh it's like eating a sliced baked potato. The Ahi Tuna entree features well prepared sticky cold rice, but flavors beyond typical Midwest capabilities.  Congrats to this restaurant for the creation. The wasabi peas were slightly disappointing- as well as the ornamental seaweed paper - but it is Pierre, SD. The leading role-  Ahi Tuna hold a delightful quality and at just $17.00 the entree is overall simply amazing.",
   "Bacon wrapped steak had a great flavor.  Sweet potato  fries were very good.",
   "Beautiful location, an interesting, varied menu, and responsive, knowledgeable service. Server, Matt, was friendly and warm without being ingratiating and made excellent food and drink recommendations. I appreciated the Impossible Burger options as that opened up a whole section of the menu for vegetarians. Veggie dining is not so easy in Pierre/Ft. Pierre, but this dinner made being a vegetarian in a mixed-eater crowd group effortless.  Portions are way bigger than necessary, so count on a take-home box!"

We swung by almost every night for my two week vacation here for a different flavored ice cream, after eating dinner. It is cash only, but it's worth it. There are some tables and chairs outside in the back.  This is an order from outside place only.  There is handicap parking available.",
   "Can\u2019t tell you the quality of ice cream. I can only say that it being \u201ccash only\u201d killed it for me. It\u2019s 2019 there are several options to get a card reader without it being a nightmare as the owner.... perhaps it\u2019s time you got an updated system? No outdoor seating or alcoves makes getting ice cream here a no go as the temps start dropping like they always do in Oct. \n\nHonestly I went to Dairy Queen because of the card options.",
   "A very dated location, but the friendly staff is very welcoming.\n\nThe large turtle was amazing. Honestly, the price was fantastic. \n\nAlthough the place can be extremely busy and requires a lot of waiting, it definitely is worth it. I would recommend attempting to sneak by during a less busy time, it is always worth it.",
   "Incredible little art deco-ish ice cream place that also serves lunch.  Service was fast and friendly, although we only ordered ice cream.  Several other customers had ordered lunch and the orders seemed to be served quickly. Reasonable prices, $4 for a small dirty river, twist ice cream, how fudge and crushed Oreos.  Next time we're in the area, we'll be back.",
   "Good selection, but no hard ice cream. But I enjoy thier malts."

I guess the only criticism I can come up with was a couple steals were slightly over. My medium rare was a full medium. On the pricey side but I really loved it.",
   "Super good!  So glad I made it here and hope to make it back again and again.  The food was delicious and service was excellent!  This would be my regular spot without a doubt.  This is my first visit to Pierre and now I have to be sure to get back here so I can have dinner at Cattleman's!!!",
   "Traveling through town, a local recommended it and we were not disappointed. Good selection of craft beers. On the way out we meet the owner and she recommended to restaurants in the area that we would like.  The atmosphere was casual and laid-back, we were in town for bird hunting and about half of the people we're dressed similarly. Know for steak, and it was good, as were the other items our group ordered.",

   "Cattleman's Club is among the best steakhouses I've ever been to. That's not a claim that I make lightly as I've eaten in great restaurants all over the world. Every time I am in the area I go to the Cattleman's Club because the steak is always cooked to perfection."

We ended up return a month or two after that and again it lived up to the expectations that we had in place based off of our first time there. Since Pub 34 closed, this is one of the best places to go here in town!",
   "This was our first experience eating there. We have heard great things and for our date night we wanted to try something new.  We got a great seat outside. Our Server Cari was quick, nice, friendly, and extremely helpful with helping us choose apps and our main course. Her suggestions were on point and did not disappoint at all. We ended up choosing two apps and 3 main dishes as everything looked amazing. The Totchos, Cheese curds for apps and the main courses Chicken Fried Steak, Southwest Cheesesteak, and the Grilled Gound were amazing as well as their aoli sauce were delicious. Trust me, they did not disappoint.. prices were great and portions were more than enough. Great drinks, amazing food, and great service. I highly recommend. Especially for a date night or family night out. Huge shout out to our server Cari, we will definitely go back because of her.",

   "The food is pretty good, but the service is often sub-par to poor.  We waited more than an hour and forty-five minutes for our food, and the place wasn't even that busy! Our waiter assured us that the kitchen was working on our meal after about an hour of waiting.  It turns out that he was being dishonest and actually never even put in our order.  He started avoiding our table.  Only after another server noticed our frustration and took it upon herself to check on our order did our server admit that he had neglected to put in our order at all.  Baffling. Honestly, the food ended up being good, but overall, it was a vexing ordeal, and the whole meal should have been comped. This is our second negative experience here.",

It\u2019s obviously time for some training , take pride in your establishment.",

The staff was rude and said we should have gone to the first, so we explained that no one was there and they rolled their eyes. They only then proceeded to tell us that the ice cream machine was \"broken\" and they couldn't make the one thing I ordered: a vanilla shake. Why didn't they tell us when we ordered? I had already had a hard day, so I didn't respond and just drove off.",
