   "Everyone living in or visiting Jackson MS needs to see this incredible museum. It\u2019s good to see Mississippi Civil Rights history next to the national history. No one teaches enough about the unsung hero\u2019s of the movement that made important strides and progress over time. Come here to learn and soak it up!",
   "It was an amazing place. Somewhere to really get connected to what has happened in Mississippi. I highly recommend the experience to everyone, all type of people. We must be aware of our history.",
   "Gorgeous museum. There is so much history, physical history, that I was in awe of. This is a very in depth, long term visit so be prepared. It's a deep, emotionally exhausting journey and should be explored at every point. Please go see this museum. It is absolutely moving.",
   "Very powerful. Very well designed.  Brought my kids here (12 & 13 yrs old) during our 2000 mile road trip through several states.  This was, far and above, the most moving civil rights experience we had.",
   "While I am relatively new to the state of Mississippi, I am quite familiar with the history of the struggles people of color have waged (and continue to wage) for equal rights under the law.  My experience at this museum yesterday afternoon was insightful, educational, inspirational, emotional, angering at times and yet powerful beyond words.  There is simply too much there to internalize in a single visit and I will be going back.  The museum directors have done an exceptional job of organizing a phenomenal collection of local Mississippi knowledge, insights and historical artifacts under one roof in a very impressive facility.  It is difficult to understate the centrality of the state of Mississippi to the experience and history of African Americans in this country.\n\nI also look forward to visiting at some point the other museum right next door to better understand the way the curators may have presented any  intersectionalities among the two collections of historical perspectives.\n\nAdditionally, I want to commend the museum staff for being incredibly helpful, friendly and professional.  I stumbled across this museum while out for a Saturday bike ride and since they didn\u2019t have any bike racks on the premises, the security guard was kind enough to allow me to keep my bike in the vestibule while I visited the museum.  (Incidentally, since there are new bike lanes springing up all over downtown Jackson, it appears there is a movement to make the city more bicycle-friendly.  What better way of reinforcing this theme than to have bike racks located at civic institutions all over the city?)\n\nFinally, perhaps my most personal insight from this first visit stems from the recognition that such a museum needed to be created in the first instance\u2014and make no mistake about it, this museum NEEDS to exist.  This reality alone speaks volumes about society\u2019s ongoing \u2018three steps forward, two steps back\u2019 approach to progress in fulfilling the original call of the founders for \u2018a more perfect union.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m a new fan of this museum and will support it going forward!"

   "Lovely scientific museum in the center of Jackson, MS!\nLots of unique specimens and dioramas.  I feel in love with the place when I noticed they had one of the best Passenger Pigeon specimens I've ever seen.  \nGiant ground sloth?  They got one!\nMastadon skull?  Yep.  Got that, too!\nScience and nature lovers will really enjoy this unique place!",
   "Lots of stuff to see out front in their display and aquarium sections.  The behind the seen labs are where the magic is.  I believe they said they had between 2 and 3 million specimens stored on site.  We saw a ton of them and didn't scratch the surface.  Really cool tour.  Thanks to all our MDWFP personnel for all you do to protect and serve our natural resources. Y'all are awesome!",
   "Museum was better than expected. Lots of information about the habitat and wildlife of Mississippi. When my sons and I were there, there was a dinosaur exhibit which was really cool. Live like dinosaurs on the outside with sounds and everything plenty of information and activities (may have to check daily schedule). The Aquarium was tho a few of the exhibits were closed. There was a small gift shop with fair prices.  Also there is a huge playground right outside of the museum area in which you can enjoy once you've paid to enter the park. If its summer months BRING WATER.",
   "Cool aquarium. Lots of free parking. Alligators,turtles, two headed snake and lot of fish. Pretty neat experience only down side not very knowledgeable or interactive staff.",
   "Great place to learn about Mississippi natural resources.  Looking deep into the far reaches of the past to see how Mississippi has come to be and the creatures that once inhabited Mississippi."

   "I've been going to Jackson for over 30 years and finally took the the time to stop by and visit this historical sight. The home is well kept. We actually had one of the neighbors come out and share some of his knowledge about this tragic assassination. He was able to point to the spot that the shot was taken. We didn't get to tour the inside because it was pretty early when we stopped by.",
   "My husband and I enjoyed visiting the home of Medgar and Merlie Evers. This visit was very insightful and educational. I would advise everyone to take their children to see this history.",
   "This is a hidden gem in Jackson. It's small and not too overwhelming like the larger museums. It has a nice timeline wall. They could do better with the room setup. But I loved the place.",
   "Excellent  Historical place to visit.  This is in a neighborhood so be courteous when parking.   Be sure not to block driveways and please do not litter.",
   "Gripping oral history of Medgar Evers' ultimate fate and his impact on the Civil Rights movement. Currently it's ran by Tugaloo College but the Parks department is taking over shortly which means it will never be the same. I'd go as soon as possible to get the full experience, otherwise, there will be a tour from a federal agency that has been gutted financially in recent years."

They are free so it is so amazing and everyone can come and visit that is so awesome. Let me pay the excise be a \u201cspecial and there\u2019s many activities that you can do while you are there. \nCons: There\u2019s not a lot of parking space and it is downtown so that may be quite something going on. Because it is free so there\u2019s not many special pictures of arms that you can see.",
   "Yesterday I got to experience an immaculate art exhibit created by Nick Cave and curated by amazing young individuals here in Mississippi. I cannot wait to see what they and the museum has to offer next! This was truly a blessed experience .",
   "The Art Museum is a great place to explore and enjoy exhibits and art work . But I really enjoy the level of service they offer for groups or individuals who choose to rent spaces for special events.\nIt is absolutely awesome and they offer a variety of menus for every occasion. \nThe fees and prices are easy to view on their website. Menu options and request are made after contacting the Museum by phone or email probably.",

   "This was a great place. I went on a school trip here and the room was fun. The hints were good and the puzzles were challenging. I liked the hints and how suddenly stuff went out of our expectations. It was really creative and I really enjoyed this place.",
   "I have done 6 or 7 escape rooms in the past few years. This was one of the good ones. We did the prison escape room (I forget the name), and we were successful. There were only three of us, which I think was a good thing, because the room was very linear. That's not a bad thing, not at all. However, I think that if we had had a larger group there would have been some people standing around waiting for something to happen. For three people, it was perfect though. We really enjoyed ourselves! The girl running the show was VERY polite and VERY friendly. We ended up chatting with her for a while after we escaped. All in all, a very good experience, and worth your time if you like escape rooms!",
   "We had so much fun! I can\u2019t wait to do another one! We booked \u201cprison break\u201d and it was so fun! I took three 12 year olds and they were so excited! They needed a lot of help. We escaped with only 1:14 seconds left! The staff is great and very helpful. My only negative is the location and the parking sucks, but as soon as you walk in it\u2019s great! Great setup! It looks like a real set!",
   "Booked the \u201cLost Cabin\u201d for my daughter\u2019s 16th birthday! We had so much fun trying to escape! One of the best escape rooms we have been to! Thanks for a great time! We will definitely be back!",
   "No words can describe how much fun this was. I have been bragging on this place since July 12th and it's had such a huge impact on how I view the people I went with. Me and my work family/friends did the \"Prison Break\" room. We all work at a jail so this should  be a breeze we thought.  But oh were we so wrong. It took us working together as a team to escape with just two minutes left. The intensity was at an all time high after thirty minutes had passed. We laughed \"ALOT\", the staff were so helpful as they helped us with the clues. It was so hilarious and serious at the same time. This would be great for team building. Get you the best group of like minded people you know to enjoy the fun with you. Its going to take all of you to win. Very challenging and exciting.  It's worth  every cent...I can't wait until our next visit. I will go anywhere with the group I was with, because I know we will survive anything together. Have fun...\u2665\ufe0f."

   "Traveling to Texas, and found this park a convenient location in Jackson MS. Pulled up to the gate to check in a few minutes after 5. No way to get.  Finally,  someone else leaving the park explained that we had to \"go online\" and pay and they would email the gate code. Very confusing to say the least. Once we managed to get into the park, we got our campsite and it was a mud hole.   The lake looks like a mud hole too.  But, on the bright side,  we're heading to the outlet mall in Jackson to shop. And we hear that there are some really good places to eat nearby.   Maybe it will get better!",
   "Beautiful place to walk and look at our gorgeous forests and rivers. It's not too hard of a walk, and the paths are pretty decently taken care of, even if they're not long. You wont regret coming to see it!",
   "We love it!! Best place ever--they just reopened after flooding so its a little muddy, but cheap laundry, hot water showers, great fishing, good tv & cell coverage- beautiful place right here in Jackson",
   "Very nice place to walk in shade around thr lake and play on the small playground. Would be nice if there were more biking trails as we have small kids and I didn't really want them on the roads, even with 15mph speed limit. Nice boat ramps to Pearl River. $4 entrance with vehicle. $.50 each person if on foot or bike. Can park at the ballpark next door. Quiet in general and a fair number of folks using the pavilions and camping facilities but not overcrowded on a Saturday. It's great to have this place right in Jackson. They also have trails to the museum area which may allow walking access to the bigger playground and picnic areas there. Will check it out next time. Thanks!",

When you first open the door you are greeted by an older women and gentlemen, both very nice folks. They have you watch about a 10 minute video on Mississippi sports, very nice short film. At first glance, I was amazed how clean and nice the museum was. As I proceeded to all of the memorabilia, I was expressed on the set up and how much stuff they had on display for all of the different athletes. I highly recommend making this one of your stops when visiting Jackson. You won't be disappointed if you're a sports fan.",
   "This is a fun place to visit. You start your visit with a movie. While entertaining, it is definitely a bit dated now. Clearly over 10 years old and showing its age in my opinion. The staff is super friendly and very enthusiastic about the place. There are many movie clips to watch throughout and you'll see many stars you recognize. The interactive exhibits- namely the one where you can record the call of a big play- are quite fun for everyone.",

   "While I wish it were a bit larger, the exhibits, staff, information, and price are top notch. A great place to spend a day along with the Ag Museum. Events are held here as well. An essential place to visit. 5 Stars!",
   "The facility was very nice and originally would've recieved 5 stars from me. However when I asked about why there wasn't any steve McNair memorabilia. The lady said they a lot it's just not on display because he was murdered, which is why it should be out on display.\ud83d\ude44 also there was  very little in Marcus Dupree & only 1 tiny article on steve McNair both of which were basically tucked away hidden in a closed off section. I feel like peoples personal biases and opinions should not overshadow what these missiapians talents and legacies. I was considering purchasing a lifetime membership but after that talk I was turned off & probably won't return. Which is unfortunate because the facility it very nice"

   "Disappointing to see a Zoo run down. The girl who took our money was not the 'face of the zoo I was expecting - sullen. As a veteran I was entitled to a cheap entry rate. I didn't ask for it because it was obvious even before we went through the gate the Zoo was run down and that they need the money.\n\nMost of the animals looked depressed. The giraffe walked around in circles while the Asian bear struggled to breathe. Some of the enclosures were so antiquated they were falling apart.\n\nWe came to Jackson Zoo for a quick stop over and to be honest we couldn't wait to leave. I know that's harsh, but the presentation of the zoo has a lot to be desired.\n\nCome on Mississippi you can do better than that! It's clear your city leaders are failing you and with elections coming up demand action to fix your Zoo.",
   "I wish it was more donations rolling in to get the zoo back to its thriving days. It needs some upkeep for sure but the animals are pure joy. I enjoyed seeing the giraffe and I loved that tut the ostrich walks along the wall following you. He's cute. I enjoyed the zoo overall.",
   "The animals aren't doing so good and parts of the park is closed due to insufficient finances.  A lot of things are over grown and broken down. It would be a great idea for them to allow volunteers from churches to help out and clean up things",
   "Pretty nice smaller zoo.  It's apparent that they care for their animals.   Enclosures were clean and the animals looked to be in good health.   Large portions of the zoo were off limits and dilapidated. Entire buildings collapsing right as you come in to zoo.  It's really got a ton of potential, but it's pretty run down.  I'll bet In it's day,  this was a wonderful zoo.",
   "It looked like the zoo was on the upswing when I moved here in 2015. Sadly, when I went last week, it was more dilapidated than ever. The animals seemed depressed and lethargic. Many of them weren\u2019t even in their exhibits. Buildings are falling in. The staff seems unengaged. We really can do better. It\u2019s time for our community to pitch in and overhaul the zoo if we want to keep it."

They have food for feeding the fish in the pond with two arch bridges and a pretty fountain. Beautiful areas for events. I give 4 instead of five stars because although so beautiful and peaceful the landscaping is under renovation in some areas. I asked about this and they are owned by the city and lacking funding. With more public support this place has high potential to be a jewel in the rough in this city.",

   "I had read some reviews and wanted to come by and check it out since they allowed pups. Upon arrival we really were taken back by the space as the decor was awesome! We grabbed a beer and found out due to MS laws that they couldn't sell mixed drinks on property but they did have tours where we can taste. So after a short wait until the next tour we had a great walk through with Zack and ended with some tastings. My wife and I enjoyed the vodka and bourbon (we aren't gin fans). After the tour I stopped by the gift shop for a hat and a bottle of bourbon for home since not distributed in Ohio as of yet. If I'm ever back in the area I will def be stopping back by!",
   "All the tasty things are made here. Hoodoo is amazing and vodka is tasty straight",
   "We went the day after Christmas and it was pretty empty, but that didn't stop Taylor from giving us her attention on a personal tour and tasting. The gin is amazing and the vodkas are great too. My bf really liked the bourbon, and we both raved about the chicory liquor. A super cool spot with good booze. Too bad they can't serve drinks there too. I bet the music festival is pretty awesome! #SupportLiveMusic",

This is a sacrament that Catholics take seriously. In the past when photographers were allowed in during the ceremony, they have been know to stand on the side altars, wander all around the main altar during Mass, or even asked to have the altar removed to allow more room ... all of which is totally disrespectful and does not allow the priest to \u201cdo his job.\u201d\n\nThe best pictures are taken prior to the wedding, and believe it or not, some nice photos can be taken \u2018through the glass\u2019 on the vestibule doors. I know this for a fact ... because of my own sons wedding.\n\nThe Cathedral is a very beautiful and welcoming church."

They did a great job with all the details - very realistic. There's also a major twist in the game, but I don't want to give anything away! The staff was professional and knowledgeable - they knew right when we needed help. This is a great way to spend an hour with friends!",
   "I've done escape rooms in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and this room was every bit as well produced and run as any I've seen. The puzzles were fun and inventive, the room was laid out very well, and the production values were fantastic. \n\nOur guide Ashton was very friendly and helpful, and ran the room expertly. I'm not from the area, but next time I'm in town visiting I'll definitely suggest Enter/Locked as a great place for a family outing.",
   "My husband and I have played all of the escape rooms at Enter/Locked and they have all been a blast! They're fun, challenging, innovative, and completely original because the owners come up with the rooms themselves.  The staff was super nice and helpful before, during, and after our game, as well.  On this particular visit, we brought some newbie friends to play The Cleaners with us and everyone left so impressed! It's such a great activity to engage in with family &/or friends because it requires attention and teamwork (unlike a movie, etc.).",
   "My first escape room experience was excellent! What a great idea for a Christmas present for the family. Our group of five was perfect for the Murder Motel. The puzzles were pretty challenging for a novice but two in the group had previous escape room experience which was very helpful. We solved in near record time!",
   "...Our church group is scheduled to go in a month. We stopped in to get group pricing and a tour.The owner Pauline was so wonderful and very helpful. She helped us decide what level of challenges would be a fit for our group and gave us a peek at one of the rooms.\nThe facility is extremely modern with a streamlined appeal.computerized signin and convenient secure parking.\nEverything about Escape Room is well planned and thought out.\nThere are different levels of and games within the game.\nThe room we viewed was awesome and the owners skillfully crafted and designed it themselves...they should probably be designing for theme parks or movie sets...it's just that good.\nWe can't wait for our trip. Groups of 10 or greater get the best discounts.\nVisit their website...call them or stop by.it's better to make an appointment for the drop in visit. But the owner is wonderfully nice."

   "You are better off going to a middle school science fair.",
   "Like other reviewers, I have to say this place is in sore need for updating and it's a crying shame that the city doesn't support this adequately. That said, our Grandkid's Spring Break was different from the local schools and we were the only one's there, but the staff treated us royally and turned what could have been an awful experience (because of a car-sick kid) into a fun, unique outing.",
   "My family and I drove several hours on a Saturday to come here. I parked and fed the meter some quarters, but was later told the meters don't need to be fed on weekends, but I can't confirm that. Come prepared with a roll of quarters. I'd rather come back out to a car for $2.00 than to discover it's been towed. \n\nAs with anywhere, be mindful of your surroundings and lock your car doors etc. We did see several drifters and drunks in the area, so just be cautious. I wouldn't leave anything in plain sight inside the car. Put it in the trunk or take it with you. \n\nIf you prefer stairs to elevators like I do, the stairs are located in an outside support \"leg\" of the building. They look like narrow brick columns with doors. Open the door and be prepared to climb to the third floor. My husband found the elevator in the opposite leg across the street from each other. A security guard inside the glass doors of the main building had to radio for staff to come unlock the stairwell for me. They were very kind about it though.\n\nRestrooms are on the 3rd floor, as well as some water fountains in a back hallway. The restrooms are in desperate need of repair and I did not see a baby changing station. I can't confirm if the water fountains even worked, but there is nothing to buy to eat or drink here, so bring your own snacks for children or those with medical needs.  \n\nThere are some mostly empty glass display cases where you'll pay admission fees. Cash only, no credit cards. I didn't see an ATM. $8.00 for adults, $7.00 for seniors, $6.00 for small children, and **that's for each movie you want to see**. There are currently three different films and they last about 40 minutes each. Younger children will likely only care for one of the three at this time. Call ahead and ask questions. \n\nAs far as a planetarium, I was expecting to relax and watch stars for awhile to a different degree than was shown. I have a high school student taking Astronomy and this was the main reason for our visit. \n\nThere is nothing else to do here, but see a few pictures on the wall and sit and wait for the next film to start. There are a few old educational displays that are not plugged in or lit up, an unused popcorn machine and an empty Coca-Cola cooler. There are a few dollar store quality toy items for sale inside the display cases. I would just bring some glow necklaces and bracelets from the dollar store and surprise the kids with them and a Moon Pie or pack of space ice cream when you arrive. \n\nThe best seats for viewing are the back rows. I am sensitive to movement, so there were a few segments in the films that made me feel like the room was spinning around slowly like a carousel or like the entire floor was turning upside down, slowly to the right, but I'm sure not everyone is that sensitive to notice. \n\nSome of the other reviews mention broken seats which we did see. The seat backs are tilted back at an angle but are not recliners. There are arm rests between all the seats, that don't move, so these would not accommodate larger visitors. Think of old, narrow movie theater or auditorium seats. We also found alot of wooden sticks from eaten rock candy lollipops on the floor. My husband said the theater smelled musty to him.\n\nThe staff here is very friendly and can help you find other things to see in the area. Educators can call for field trip packets and information.",
   "The Russel C. Davis Planetarium is one of two planetarium statewide. It is located in downtown Jackson and is dedicated to imparting knowledge about space earth the environment the human body and the sciences in general. For those who don't know the domed ceiling is used as a screen and movies about various subjects are projected there. The movies generally take you to the place described for instance space or inside the human body. If you're in town with kids this may be a fun distraction. If you are local and happen to never have been you definitely should go.",

Why bother having a museum and nature trail, if you don't want people to see the logs in 50 years? $$$\n\n If you put up a fence around a bunch of petrified logs, charged people money to walk on a trail and look at said logs, and then were unfriendly, you would have copied the business model here.

   "First off this is a very laid back & relaxing boat tour of the Barnett Reservoir. Although it was a hot afternoon in June when we went, surprisingly the boat is open enough to keep you at least comfortable and somewhat cool. The boat has seating with or without tables and there is good music playing. They offer free drinks (either water or soda) while on the tour. The tour is about 1.5hrs. You go about 45 minutes out and then back.There were only 2 other groups on the tour the day we went so it wasn't crowded.  We sat up front and the captain was very nice, and informative. He gave a thorough history lesson about the reservoir and the surrounding areas. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone in the area especially if you want to relax and learn about the area.",
   "A very nice ride for an hour. very scenic, calm and refreshing.  Jason who owns the boat is very friendly and shared a great deal of knowledge. Must go and have the experience for your self.",
   "The boat ride was pleasant.  However, we were invaded by millions of mosquitoes which made for an unpleasant experience.   This is no fault of Sweet Olive, it's just nature.  Perhaps they can devise a way to keep out the mosquitoes.",
   "I just seen it passed by when fishing on my dad's boat",
   "I invited my friends and family for a cruise on the Sweet Olive in June.  It was so beautiful and relaxing on the Rez that three weeks later two of us returned for a second cruise. The boat is clean and comfortable, the music is nice and Captain Jason is so gracious.  The hospitality is unbeatable. The next time you see the Sweet Olive Boat passing by, just wave to it because I just might be on my THIRD cruise waving back to you.  We loved it!"

   "Good morning,\n\nI am extremely disturbed and offended. I frequent the city of Jackson. This is my second time in less the 45 days of being at your property.\n\nThis morning I came off of the elevator at 3:48am to await my driver. Noticing my driver had not yet arrived I decided to sit in the lobby to wait.  A few minutes later I\u2019m approached by your hotel security guard being asked forcefully \u201chey, do you have a room here.\u201d I looked at him and sir, don\u2019t bother me.\u201d He said \u201clisten here if you don\u2019t have a room here you can sit in here.\u201d\n\nMind you, I\u2019m sitting in the lobby with $7000 worth of Louis Vuitton luggage on, a $500 Robert graham shirt, $200 jeans and $300 Robert graham shoes. I am obviously no transient vagabond looking for a place to duck out of the cold.\n\nThe security noticed I was not going to accept being harassed without resistance said \u201cI\u2019m just telling you what she told me.\u201d I asked \u201cwho is she\u201d, he pointed towards the front. I then said tell her don\u2019t bother me either. He continues to persist that I needed to leave. So I proceed to walk over to where \u201cshe was.\u201d She is your night auditor Shonda; who is seated 40 feet from the elevator outside of your business center with her feet kicked up on a chair wrapped in a blanket watching TV. She is 40 feet from the same elevators I had just come off of. Had she not been so consumed in her television show she would have both heard and seen me come off of the elevator. I walked over to her and demanded her name and told her that the way she was seated over there the question should be asked is she a guest or is she working. She proceeded to demonstrate her contempt by jumping up and and grabbing a business card to hand to me.\n\nA white guest came off of the same elevator and was greeted with great kindness. Another white guest walked in off the street  with slippers and a robe on and a coffee mug in hand and was greeted with great kindness. But the black man is harassed, and disrespected.\n\nIt is disgusting that such blatant displays of racism are still apart of the American reality. Especially from one black person to another.\n\nI sent my complaint in, tangent manager responded promising to call me but never did.\n\nIf you\u2019re a person of color this may not be the hotel for you.\n\nSincerely, a disgusted customer",
   "Small apartments for small people. The ceilings are like 4 inches from the floor. But they have a cool kitchen. And clean carpet.",
   "I currently live in the King Edwards.   I have the small one bedroom on the 12th floor I rented without visiting first due to being from out of town.  First of all the personnel Danielle M was so helpful with the application, questions etc.  Security guard, Parks was helpful ! .  I met Molly last week.   Molly is nothing but pure energy, delight .   She is a resource for things to do or where to go in Jackson.   She definitely knows what is going on downtown in the community and around the area.   The apartments are very nice.   I wish that they kept the stairways cleaner and the trash swept up outside.   I have noticed taking the stairs that the janitor or the repairman have left equipment, trash on the stairwells in between floors.   I love the rooftop and the little pool.   The workout room is nice along with community room.   The whole floor is quiet!    They have apartments on the 9, 10, 11, and 12th floor.  You do have to pay for your electric and internet .  Also parking is 75.00 dollars a month for covered in the garage but it\u2019s worth it!!   You have keyed entry so your secure.  I love it.  Mailbox is downstairs.",
   "Beautiful lobby, but the rooms were rather small, plus you has to pay for parking",

Also an awesome place to walk in the evening.  If you time it just right and begin walking back to your car just before dusk, you will see numerous deer.  Bucks of all sizes hang together then does of all sizes hang together.  Sometimes they\u2019re intermingled.  But to easily see 35 is putting a conservative number on it.  If you love wildlife, it\u2019s definitely a place to go walk.",

Start off in the visitor center and catch the quick free movie on Vicksburg,  then drive through the park.",
   "Great, fascinating National Military Park. Wonderful movie with lots of great background for those like me whose school education covered the Civil War in its entirety in about a week.\n\nVolunteers Roger and Connie are wonderful. Roger knows a ton about the Military history and enthusiastically shares it in the depth appropriate to his audience. Connie knows the military but also the stories of area residents and the human history of living through such a lengthy siege. \n\nRoads are well marked with markers explaining troop positions and strategies. One of the best parts, though, is all the monuments donated by states, societies, and families to commemorate their troops, family members, and contributions to this battle. Some monuments were very ornate and impressive. Others were of a simpler design but equally impressive in their quiet, subdued way. \n\nBlue signs mark the Union positions and red mark the Confederates. History is always interpreted by the winner, so the slant is more Union, but it is nice to see the story of the Confederacy included in a factual, respectful way!\n\nI wish I had more time to walk the trails and see more of the areas on foot, as a soldier did over 150 years ago. (It's an amazing difference to see it from the ground on foot rather than your car. The roads are built to provide a higher vantage point. Trust me:  get out and walk around.)",
   "I liked starting the experience with the video in the Visitor's Center. It helped a lot with giving a full overview so that I could appreciate the driving tour through the park better. So I would recommend starting there.\n\nI also recommend visiting the Cairo Museum. I found seeing the boat especially interesting.",
   "An outstanding place to visit. The somber atmosphere will cause deep contemplation and gratitude for soldiers on both sides of the war. A really enriching place to visit. The entrance for vehicles closes early, but it's a beautiful place for an evening or early morning walk. The park hosts events periodically for patriotic events. They also do somewhat of a live reenactment complete with cannon fire."

   "What an amazing National Park, spent the day here with my Jr. Ranger and my family, could have spent a week wandering this entire park. Such an amazingly thought out Park, the monuments and drivable tour was a perfect experience for everyone. Its mindblowing that so many had to lose their life over such a simple solution to the end of slavery, a very powerful experience for sure and a great place to road school your kids!",
   "A piece of history that most will never see. The museum, itself, is small but the Cairo remains are truly impressive. I highly recommend.",
   "The restoration and presentation of this civil war battleship is spectacular from bow to stern. The ship is beautiful in itself, but the architecture of the museum and the exhibits in it are unique and informative also.",
   "Any visit to Vicksburg national military Park should include a walk around one of the amazing ironclads that were in service turn the civil war. The national Park service has done a great job in restoring this sunken ironclad that was one of the vessels so important to the union victory at Vicksburg.  Being able to walk through it and around it was very impactful, and gave me the sense of what it was like to be a sailor on the vessel...",
   "Great artifacts, great layout, and knowledgeable staff on site. The history of the ship is so interesting. Take your time while you're here and ask the guides a lot of questions. They're glad to talk about the battles, the ship's history, and it's preservation."

   "Wonderful trails! There's a great family of beavers that live on the back end of Shadow Lake and they have an amazing set of tunnels going into their dams. We stayed in the cabins and will be back to enjoy the views again in June! Thank you so much for the wonderful time and the clean cabin. I haven't been able to just relax with my husband in SO long and we definitely needed this. Support your parks!",
   "This Park is Really Nice have so many amenities that you will not believe can find on a Forest Park the list is so big let see they have 6 Natural Trails, Huge Lake named Shadow Lake, have 109 sites for RV Camping, Primitive Camping Area, 4 Pavilions, Like 13 Cabins, They Have a Motel with many room's and all have windows to the lake, Boat Ramp, many Bathhouse all around the Park, they have a Water Slide and Pool, Fishing, Disc Golf, Playground, Alfreda Harris Lodge, Livingston Performing Arts Center, Ballfield & Tenis Court, Conference Room, Video Games, Pool Tables and many other things that I will not finish if continue so if have the Time Come and Visit also the Observation Tower outside on the Hill if is close ask and they opened for you. Enjoy and Love the Nature.",
   "The lake and scenery are beautiful, but the park is desperately in need of TLC. We were disappointed to see the lookout tower closed, vandalism in several places, worn out structures and fallen trees everywhere. It looks like they are operating on a tiny budget and what was once a magnificent resort-type retreat in now dilapidated and sad. The tennis court is overgrown, wood rot is noticable on many buildings. Canoe rentals have been discontinued, our cabin was very small, had no blankets (in mid-January), was missing toilet paper and a coffee pot when we arrived, but the office staff quickly brought a small coffee pot and toilet paper after we called to let them know (we didn't mention the blankets because we brought our own). The cleaning lady and the lady at the front desk were very friendly and helpful, but you can sense that they know the condition of the park has decreased from its former glory. Our cabin (#11) was tiny, but located right on the water. The room with two beds was smaller than a typical hotel room. The bath and kitchen also very tiny. There was a good size screened in front porch and huge screened in back porch (some wood rot made it feel unsafe in spots). Unfortunately, because the temps were so cold we spent very little time on the porches.  The cost to rent the cabin was $80 a night, but we've spent less for much nicer accomodations at other Mississippi State Parks. There is also a 2 night minimum for cabin rentals here, making this experience too expensive for a return visit.",
   "We pulled our camper in here and stayed for one night on a long trip from Tennessee back to Texas. This campground is so beautiful. We woke up to an amazing view in the woods and on the banks of the lake. It is quiet, peaceful, serene and just makes you enjoy camping. Sites are spacious. Clean bathhouse.\n\nAlso, pleasantly surprised to discover a little playground right behind our campsite. The kids loved it in the morning as we were packing up. They had a huge water slide too. We didn\u2019t get a chance to use it but it looked awesome.\n\nWe could have stayed at this campground a couple of days if time would have allowed. \n\nEasily accessible off of I-20.\n\nVery friendly staff with southern hospitality.",
   "It has a nice lake to fish, swim, boat, or water ski in. It also has a swimming pool and a water slide if you don't want to swim in the lake. The staff was very nice. The cabin we stayed in (#11) has  screened-in front and back porches with picnic tables it has a bar-b-q pit outside. It sleeps 4 but has not been updated in a long time if I had to guess I would say the 70s. The beds were not that comfortable. There is no table in the cabin so you have to go outside on the porch to eat. I like eating outside so that didn't bother me.There is a refrigerator, stove, coffee pot, and microwave, but no toaster. If you plan on cooking you will need to bring your own pots, pans, ect. They is two very small pots, one frying pan, one big serving plate, spoon, fork, and spatula. plastic plates, cups, bowls and silverware for 4 and that it."

   "Probably one of my favorite places to go in Jackson.  The bar is incredible.  It actually took my breath away when I first walked in, because it's just that stunning with it's floor to ceiling assortment of wines and liquors. That and the fact that the smell coming from the kitchen was divine - I was hooked before I even sat down to eat!  THEN I ate.....no matter what you try here , I promise - it will be incredible! The steaks, fish, pizza....you cannot go wrong. Oh, and their ranch dressing is drinkable. Seriously.",
   "The place was a little loud, this was first time  I was there when there was a lot of people. The food was excellent, I had a fire grilled whole red snapper which was very well seasoned and was enough for two people. My salad was large and very good also.  While Manship has a large wine selection they charge a premium price and then some.  Some wine by the glass were as much or more than the bottle price at other top restaurants. Service this night was a little slow and we had trouble flagging down the server for water.",
   "Food was very rich and wonderfully flavored. The wait staff was excellent, polite, and knowledgeable. This place is beautifully decorated with attention to detail. The tuna dip was so flavorful, and my fiance and I loved the short rib ragu, fennel lasagna, and the Spanish home fries.",
   "The pizza was good except for the basil being baked in the pie. It should go on top when the pie is taken out of the hob, it was nearly burnt. The Cesar salad was very good. It was covered in plenty of dressing. Most places barely put dressing on the salad. There was no hint of fish in the dressing, another plus. There is no salt or pepper available for customers at the table. I asked for black pepper and was given way more than needed in a little pot (see picture). Cut bread and olive oil with red and black peppers is served at the beginning. It was good too. I ordered the Smoked Gouda Grits which was good. The grits seemed to have yellow corn in them like polenta. The seats were dirty when we got to the table and had to be cleaned. We never could order anything to drink except for water. All in all it was a good meal.",
   "I really wish I could.have rated this higher. The atmosphere was great, as were the staff and our server. The flavor profiles for the food were a bit off. The complementary focaccia bread and oil were good, but oil needs to be served in a shallower dish so seasoning at bottom can be tasted. Crab beignets (crab cake balls) while full of crabmeat, lacked seasoning. The color slaw could use a bit of sweetness. The grilled chicken on my ceasar salad, while it was flavorful, the texture was off, slightly rubbery. The best parts were the sweet tea and the triple chocolate (white, milk, and dark) mouse. I would go back for drinks and dessert."

I spent a lot of time here with family looking at the power of water and everything the corps of engineers has done to engineer the power of the river. A really fun place to stop by if you are visiting Vicksburg.",

   "This is a very cool place. The scale models inside are amazing and there is a scale model of the battle for Vicksburg that was so helpful in understanding the battle placements. Curators are really nice.",
   "Absolutely loved this museum. Unbelievable diorama of the Siege of Vicksburg. There is a world-class collection of river boats of every kind imaginable. The artist/model maker was there when we visited and was amazing to talk to.\n\nTrains of all scales are in one area of the museum. Children of all ages are mesmerized just taking it all in. Great job!!\n\nFinally, enough cannot be said about the docents and knowledgeable staff. Don't miss the one-of-a-kind museum.",
   "This place is a GEM.  The two lady docents that work there are knowledgeable and friendly. You can\u2019t go wrong by coming here. You\u2019ll get a real insight into life in Vicksburg before, during and after the Civil War. Model trains, paddle boats, blockade runners and a movie that will give you insight into the civilian experience in the Civil War in Vicksburg. Great gift shop too"

   "Great experience. Dr. Sistrunk is a great doctor. He took time to go over my history and my diagnosis. He showed me my images and labs and explained what they meant. He explained to my diagnosis to me and how he came up with the diagnosis. The staff was very professional, nice and helpful. I would highly recommend Jackson Thyroid and Endocrine to anyone with thyroid issues.",

He\u2019s by far the best endocrinologist I\u2019ve met. He do have nurses but I noticed he like to do hands on with his patients so he\u2019ll know exactly what is going on.

   "Such a fantastic Jackson restaurant! The margaritas and food are delicious!  I am a huge fan of this place because it's family friendly, but also a great option for date night!  Also - brunch is SO GOOD.  My favorite marg is the Notorious PINK one - hands down my favorite in the city. They have a great happy hour, excellent service and a fun atmosphere.  Also - the guacamole is a great meal by itself!  :)",
   "This place was absolutely amazing. Ordering the guacamole was an experience on its own. They make it fresh right in front of you and it is absolutely delicious. I would also recommend the Mexican street corn. Like heaven in your mouth. We ordered 4 tacos, all great, a kids burger, two margaritas and a sangria. Our bill was 74. Given the quality of the food this was a great price. Also super kid friendly. The place was loud so kids are not a problem. I loved the decor as well. If it wasn't so hot in the afternoon we would have eaten outside. So far this has been my favorite restaurant while visiting Jackson.",
   "AMAZING Food and Service. We have three kids and our waiter, Kevin, was exceptional! We tried several things from there menu and were not disappointed!!!  Plus, the kids meal are super impressive (which is really rare).  We drove about 15mins out of the way for this place and it was totally worth it. Highly recommend!",
   "The burgers are good. Tacos not worth the money. Definitely would recommend eating in. Never order take out. If to go is needed do green ghost",
   "Arrived in Jackson in time for lunch - downtown area was deserted but here it was crowded. I guess this is where everyone goes on Sunday. Service was great even with the number of people dining I did not have to wait more than a few minutes for a table for one. The menu is full of interesting items and I had a very difficult time picking. I went with the Cuban sandwich and coffee. Both were excellent - the sandwich was a good as those I have had made by Cubans in Key West. Each table is given chips and a melted cheese dip. Thanks goodness I had not ordered more food because that dip was the best. I ate all of it."

Service is quick and professional. Drinks are well mixed. Nice wine list; limited, but good section of beer. Great appetizers and salads; except seafood should be off the menu if it has been frozen or refrozen. Steaks are excellent, but, not great. Nice decadent deserts.",
   "Always great food and service.Waiting area isn't very big. Love the new larger back area addition. \nDownside they always run out of crab claws!! Triple your order please. My twins love them, it's hard to tell a 6 year old after they've ordered those little suckers sorry babies they are all gone \u2639\ud83d\ude02. Would you like something else? ??? Of course not they are six! I'm 40 and about to cry over them being gone. Great place to eat with family and friends.",
   "The ambiance is always nice and this time was no exception. Our server was beyond courteous and conversational but not overly. The food was delicious (I had the pan seared redfish); so much so I wanted more. The menu never disappoints whether I'm dining for lunch or dinner.",
   "We tried this place for the first time last night. Went with my dad for a nice dinner and Char did not disappoint! Fried green tomatoes were so so but the red fish with broccoli was amazing. Pecan pie with vanilla stole the show. Will definitely be back here soon. The whole fare is pricey but I liked the restaurant and food so wouldn't mind paying. Can't believe we didn't try Char earlier!",
   "This first time we ate at this restaurant. A bit pricy but we deserved all the pampering we received. Jessica was our server, she was fantastic, refilled our drinks. We went around brunch time. We ordered steak( Cooked to perfection} & redfish she suggested a different sauce than what was on the menu. My friend was well satisfied. So much food had to get a to-go box. Surprised us with a free hot pecan pie with ice cream! We will go again for a special occasion!"

I had thought I would eat responsibly but I saw an order of nachos go by and impulsively ordered them. They are delicious and well worth the calories! Big enough to share too. The ribs are awesome. Get the dry rub and add the sauce!! The pork rinds are done just right. The white chocolate bread pudding is a must.",
   "Great food. Helpful staff. We had a large party of 8 and they were patient with us. Brisket was very juicy. Tacos were good. Ribs were great. Wings we got dry with sauce on the side. Beer was great, tons to choose from. Place was very laid back, and family friendly. Bathroom was cute with the poop plunger and the power mixer paddle as the toilet paper holder. Very creative! Would definitely recommend.",
   "As soon as I opened the car door, the scent of smoked meat hit me, fair amount of parking and outdoor seating. I ordered takeout, half rack ribs/wet and a pound of pork. The rib flavor was incredible, great balance of chipotle and garlic with good bark. It was rather fatty like it hadn't rendered the fat enough. The pulled pork was spot on.",
   "One week I was craving BBQ so I decided to try y'all out. I will say its not bad but if you like an oven broiled/wood chips flavor. The meat was coated heavily in pepper and spices and BBQ sauce but it didn't pack a char grilled taste. I would give it an A for tenderness but overall taste I will definitely say the sides make up for that. Baked beans and Mac and cheese were on point.",

Really love the Carolina style (yellow) sauce. My favorite is the brisket and pulled pork tacos. Sometimes the food is not warm enough. Other than that it\u2019s great."

The atmosphere, excellent customer service, the manager checking in on us and cracking a few good jokes and making sure we were having a good time all contributed to this being an amazing day for her. They always strive to make every moment special and I've never had a bad service experience here. I don't know how they continue to hire such wonderful staff but they should offer a training course to some of the other restaurants around here! If you're visiting Jackson, MS I definitely recommend you try this restaurant! It's a local favorite. Thanks Bravo team for making this evening for my sister one to remember.",
   "My husband and I visited Bravo for our Anniversary. We enjoyed the atmosphere. Our server was great. The food was delicious and fulfilling. However, the only thing that bothered us was that the gentleman that sprinkled cheese on the entrees that were being served did not wear gloves. He did this with his bare hands. This is not sanitary. After seeing this, we opted for no cheese or garnish on our dish. Bravo, please change this serving policy. Overall, everything else was great.",

Great idea! \nThe parking is a little scary but it is well worth it.",
   "On a 16 hr road trip with several kids we looked up this place 4 hrs before Jackson. Made a reservation and from the moment I walked in they made us feel like home. \n\nOrder their family platter with 2 orders of lamb chops. Extra humus and tea.\n\nThis was our early dinner before heading to TX. \n\nThanks for feeding us and letting us take over the entire corner. The lady who took our order and managed to keep track of all the dishes was simply AWESOME !!!",
   "Authentic Mediterranean food! My gyro sandwich was exceptional. The iced tea was cold and minty. The food is very affordable the the portions are substantial.\n\nIf you are tired of ordinary chain restaurants, this place is one of a kind, comfortable and inviting. We are glad we decided to try Aladdin's.",
   "Great Mediterranean food in Jackson, MS.\nThey got a good variety of entrees. Chicken Lula was our favourite during our visit. We friends visited this place on the way back from our camping trip. We were 14, the waitresses rearranged the table for us to accommodate all 14 in a single table. Will definitely visit again if I am in Jackson again. Keep doing the wonderful work guys. I have added some photos to show how the ambience of the restaurant is. Hope this is helpful for future visitors",
   "I had the Vegetarian Platter, and it was amazing.  The falafel was crispy, and the hummus had a surprisingly strong lemon bite. Portion sizes are generous. I had to make sure I saved room for baklava. Service was friendly and reasonably fast considering how crowded they were."

I think we may have been a bit under dressed than some of the others, but that didn't seem to be a problem. I am so glad we decided to go here! After weeks of rain, the clouds parted and I met a friend at Walkers Drive In. First of all it is not a Drive In, it is a sit and eat, in or our, Art Deco Style chic but easy Restaurant that is always almost full of diners who, like me come back over and over again.",
   "Excellent food and service.  The red fish with lump crab was amazing!  Wonderful flavors cooked right.  The red snapper with mushrooms and capers was also a real treat.  Alex was a pleasure to deal with and provided excellent, friendly service while answering questions and making suggestions.  Then to top it all off we delighted in the Mississippi peach fried pie, dusted with cinnamon and sugar served with a vanilla bean ice cream and white chocolate sauce. It was absolute heaven.  Crisp and clean flavor. Not overly sweet or oily tasting. Sheer perfection.  You cannot go wrong dining at Walker\u2019s Drive-In.",
   "Excellent service, fresh and delicious food! The veal and lobster kathy was unforgettable! Definitely the best upscale restaurant in Jackson.",
   "We had to wait just a few minutes for our table for two, but it was well worth the wait. The main dining room is very small and sometimes you have to almost turn sideways to negotiate a table, but again well worth it. The food was out of this world. We had a wonderful wedge salad with a \"to die for\" filet served over a cheddar mash wth asparagus. The beef was almost tender enough to cut without a knife and the potatoes had a wonderful flavor. For desert I had some sort of decadent chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream while my companion had a grapefruit \"tart\" desert. We both agreed that our dining experience at Walker's was one of if not the best dining experience in a long time.",

Never have had a bad pasta; all made in-house. We had a triple fin white fish that was amazing just before Christmas. Despite the risotto being a bit overpowering for the fish, the fish was one of the best white fish we have ever had in our international travels. I come here for business at least once a month and make sure to come back to visit every 3-4 months.",
   "Wow! What a great experience we had in hosting our son's rehearsal dinner with Parlor Market. It was held in their gorgeous private room, 'Albert's', a few doors down from the restaurant. From the start, we had superb communication with great listening--making our event what we wanted (not what they wanted). I love how they manage to 'yes' and are customer driven. The food was exquisite. The service was impeccable. I can not rave enough about the attention to detail in food preparation/presentation, graciously kind service and an overall level of excellence in hospitality. Thank you Parlor Market for making our evening so very special! We especially thank chefs Joe and Robert and our incredible team of Taylor, David, Jennifer, Mackenzie, Vince and Matti. You were all superb and we loved working with you.",
   "I have never minded paying for food, but every single item at parlor market is over priced by about 30%. Its not that any of the food or service is bad, its just that it is hard to justify buying their 38 dollar steak, when you know its not as good as other steaks you have had at that price range. same for the pasta (shrimp scampi), hangar steak (which is their signature, and is simply not great). I have now eaten there 3 separate times, and thought the exact same thing each time - I could do better.",

I saw what I thought was a place with veggie burgers BUT it wasn't. When the woman behind the counter saw my slightly disappointed face, she remedied the \"problem\" and made me (and my friend) a FANTASTIC improvised \"burger\" of piled high sauteed mushrooms, peppers, onions, fresh tomato slices and a yummy sauce on a big wrap. My friend and I were in HEAVEN. And the way the potato was prepped was a first-time for us both - and I wish I could remember the name the place had given it.",

The color was an off purple. My husband's wasn't much better. The oysters were tiny, we ordered a dozen but they gave us 18 to make up for it. Our waiter was super friendly but the woman who seated us never smiled the whole time we were there. It was raining and she escorted us through a patch of carpet with 1/2 an inch of water to splash through because the roof was leaking. I was so looking forward to the delicious salad I had there 2 years ago but that was not to be. $57 + a $10 tip We won't be back.",

   "Went on a Sunday afternoon when it wasn't busy.  Are waiter was very attentive.  The food was excellent, and was able to relax and enjoy myself. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good pasta dish or seafood.  It's a little pricey, but it's worth it."

   "This place is somewhat of a hidden gem. The hamburger itself was not the standard burger joint frozen thin one. It was thick about a quarter inch or more. I had a choice of side. I got the onion rings. These were outstanding too. Not frozen ones that I cannot stand. They have a different evening menu but I think it looks good. I intend to go back and try the sword fish steak",
   "Seeking an alternative to the usual suspects when visiting Jackson over night, I was told to check out Lou's. Located in a gentrified 1960's shopping center on Fortification, Lou's turned out to be a delightful spot for dinner. It was a chilly night and their comfort food took care of its business. Braised Short Ribs and a proper Pittsburgh Rare Beef steak found happy homes..........oh, my scotch was fair enough and the service was professional too.",
   "Every dish we ordered was Very tasty!  Yes it is kind of pricey for what you get, but it was absolutely delicious.   Cut the tails off your shrimp and grits.  Red fish was done perfectly and I\u2019m a picky fish eater.  Short ribs were a nice tasty hunk of meat.  And the kids steak was good. 7 year old thought it was a little spicy. (Maybe pepper). Lol",
   "Absolutely amazing. I got the brisket sandwich but oh goodness was it outstanding! Side if onion rings were divine but to top it all off..... \n\nI don't like bread pudding. At all. But their bread pudding is something I was convinced to try and I was NOT disappointed. I may have eaten too much of it because it was so good!",
   "Yeah, sex is good. But have you had the bread pudding at Lou's? We went Monday and Friday and had two very different experiences. The place was dead Monday and we had extremely attentive service. And since it was our first visit the server gave us stellar recommendations (the teres major was the most perfect medium rare beef I've ever had). Friday was much busier but we still got high quality service. Expensive by Mississippi standards but really great grub. Homemade ice cream, all kinds of fresh goodness. Great cocktails, big selection of bottled beers, no taps."

   "This place is like taking a step back in time...literally. The outside is very unassuming and the inside reminds me of my great great grandmother's house. Parking is extremely limited. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the employees are quite friendly and welcoming. The decor is very much of times past. Each of the tables are old dining room tables with assorted chairs. The tables clothes all have doilies as place settings. It's wonderful!",
   "Absolutely love Bully's. I recommend every item. Just keep going till you try em all. Delicious, good sized portions and super friendly staff. 100% southern hospitality and comfort food.",
   "Our family was driving through Jackson Mississippi on vacation and I saw this place on TripAdvisor. Always up for an adventure, we went out of the way and are so glad we did! Open since 1982, this family-owned business is definitely worth a visit. Bully himself popped out of the kitchen to welcome us, and the service was super friendly and helpful. We had lunch specials and everyone was super pleased, adults and kids alike. Our favorites were the greens, cornbread, turkey necks, fried chicken, fried green tomatoes, and peach cobbler. DO NOT MISS THE COBBLER!",
   "Food is great so I'm giving it 5 stars. However, if you are from out of state as we were, understand that this is a hole in the wall, the wait for the food will be long, and it will be served on cafeteria style plates; look past that. They put their foot in that food and it is a must if you're in town so you can get that real soul food deliciousness. Definitely check it out.",

   "The place is in a corner of an inside mall/building. The burgers and fries are great, and the onion rings are some of the best I have eaten (not greasy). We were in a hurry, and although not fast food, it was quicker than most. The chicken is great too. Stopped for lunch- it was sunny, clean, fast, friendly.... and the best chicken sandwich and grilled chicken on salads in a long time. Mac and cheese was decent (not to die for- but a good solid side). Would definitely eat here again. It got busy at noon- we were just a few min ahead of the crowd.",
   "The fried chicken was spot on. I had the fried chicken club and my wife the hot hot fried chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. The only reason I don\u2019t give this place the 5 stars is the curly fries. I love curly fries but these were a bit greasy and lacked some flavor.",
   "The food was delicious . My husband and myself both ordered hamburger steak with 2 sides.  It's the best hamburger steak I have eaten in years.  The atmosphere was great. They had my kind of music playing.  The late 70's and 80's Rock and roll music.  It was so relaxing to sit down and have a great meal.  I will be going back to eat here again.  We were at the University hospital and when I finished up with everything I turned my maps on and asked where a nice close restaurant was to eat at. And it pulled up Roosters.",
   "It's not easy to leave a place like this..and not be absolutely stuffed. 8oz perfectly cooked patty. Huge helping of home cooked fries, and cold crisp cole slaw. I'm in heaven. Make this a bucket list stop. Probably the best burger in Jackson..period.",
   "Food was hot. Service was fast but front of house staff was a little rough around the edges and boisterous. Creole Chop steak was a great lunch choice. Red beans and rice was ok. Generous portions."

   "We stopped for lunch while in the area on the recommendation of the guys at the Hawkins Jet Center. We were very pleased. The service was amazing. I forget the ladies name who served us, but she was getting married soon. She was amazing and on top of everything. We never wanted for anything. The chips they bring were awesome, love the flavor of the spices that they put on them and the salsa was really good too, without being too hot. My husband ordered the ribs and was very pleased with them. The atmosphere is really nice and love all of the woodwork in the place. Would recommend to anyone and when we are in the area we will come back.",
   "I've eaten here a few times, but had never been with a large group for a work function until recently. I wasn't sure how it would go over, but it turned out to be great time. The food was excellent, and the staff was wonderful. We had our function upstairs and had plenty of room even with having over 100 people. The only complaint we heard was that the parking was limited. But with a group our size, it would have been better to do more carpooling.",
   "Wasn't sure what to expect but received great service and delicious food. Other's kids were there having a great time. The stage is beautiful, would love to go back and see a good show. And so many unique things inside to see. Worth a visit or more.",
   "Apparently, I wasn\u2018t expecting a longer break during my Greyhound travel (1 hour). So I was just seeing this grill when we were driving by and I decided to quickly go in there and check what they have and if I can take it with me. At the end, it was just SO good I did so! I just wish there was more time to discover the grill itself a bit longer... I ordered a small cup of chili together with the Iron House Salad (with blue-cheese dressing) for taking out. While waiting, I grabbed the chance to step into the \u201amuseum\u2018 they have on the 1st floor. Even that was quite fun and experiencing, too.",
   "Great Food! Decor is overall awesome! Perfect if you love live music! They have weekly lunch specials that are great! If you want a to come in and rock out or just have a few drinks combined with great food, this is your place!"

   "We were tired after driving all day, so was nice to have a restaurant and bar right in the hotel as an option. The Library Lounge (separate review) is right next to the restaurant, and also serves small plates. When we moved to the restaurant, we were the only ones in there, and it stayed that way through our entire meal. Granted, it was a little early, but that was surprising. The decor is nice enough and the place is spotless. We were surprised at how slow it was getting our food, especially since we were the only ones in there. However, the food was quite good.",
   "Beautiful restaurant. But the execution just wasn't there. The music was piped in. The service while polite was, let' say, not prompt. The food was fine but should have been better, e.g. no rare prime rib. Deserts were wonderful.",
   "I was not impressed with the food or the service. We were a group of thirteen with a 7 PM reservation.  We were seated promptly, and basically had the restaurant to ourselves. We had to ask for water \u2014 and had to keep asking, as no one was paying attention.  It took a good half hour before the waiter took our entree orders. Our waiter disappeared so often, we joked that perhaps he was also the chef...  Entrees were served at 8:50 PM. My pasta with shrimp was inedible due to the heavy use of spice (and I like spicy food).  Others in the group reported cold soup.  I would not eat there again.",
   "Some of my girl friends and I came for their Sunday brunch. It's in a very cute white building that looks like the Fresh Princes house. There's a live piano player and a nice waiting area with a fire place. The Sunday buffet was $20/person. This rating is just for their brunch, not regular restaurant hours and menu items.\n\nOnly thing I really liked was the etouffee and salmon, everything else was just okay. I'd rather spend more on one good plate of food off of their menu.\n\nThere's a waffle and omelet station, but isn't much for you choose from to put in your omelet or waffle...\n\nIt's a nice white table cloth restaurant, I'd like to come back and try some of their menu items.",

On my order I order two meals well one never came out and after waiting on my other meal to come it was cold when they brought it out. I never received the second order. I asked the waitress to just cancelled  it. On the order that I did recieved it was not cooked like I asked them to cook my steak I asked for med well. Well it was over well it was burned but I ate it cause I was hungry. I will not be returning  no time soon."

The beef salad was good but did add some heat with the house chili sauce.",

Retro atmosphere great service incredible food. Redfish was some of the best I\u2019ve had. Use the great rolls to sop up the flavor from the plate. Definitely a place to revisit.",
   "We happened into the Mayflower on a quiet night.  In every sense like dropping back a few decades, including the decor and the friendly, gracious staff.  The salad was small and simple, as I remember their being when I was young, but the secret house dressing was wonderful.  We had stuffed flounder and the fancy trout, and we could not have enjoyed them more.  One of the most enjoyable restaurant experiences I have had in recent memory.",
   "Iron Chef Cat Coral said she always eats here when she's in town, so this place gotta be good. The fried pork chop is nicely seasoned and fried. Stuffed crab was a little small, but probably because it's a lunch portion. Steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. Gumbo was good. I need to come back for their liver and onions, one of my favorite things to eat!"

   "The decor on the outside and the inside is very beautiful. It was my first time eating at the restaurant and I almost walked out. This place is only opened on Thursday thru Saturday. Since I went on a Saturday night,  they were out of basically half the menu. I still decided to stay and order something and I was glad that I did. I had the fish tacos  and my husband had the red beans and rice. We also had a brownie for dessert. All the food was full of flavor and spicy. The red beans and rice was good but too spicy for my liking. It was my first time trying fish taco but I was very impressed. They were so good with the mild sauce. It was like a sea garden full of flavor. Next time I'll go on a Thursday so I can try more items from the menu",
   "Came here on my husband's birthday. I had the red beans and rice (excellent with full flavor and generous portions), and he had the shrimp tacos (tons of shrimp and good flavor). We didn't wait very long at all.\n\nDon't let the location scare you off (next to a gas station)! The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, service is nice, and the food is great. Not a lot of options on the menu and it's a little pricey, but overall good value for money!",
   "The surf and turf gumbo with shrimp, chicken and sausage is outstanding. It may seem a little expensive but this isn't a thin, watery gumbo with a few ingredients for flavoring. This is a thick, rich gumbo with a lot of ingredients. Expensive to make, great to eat. It was a little hot for the tastes of our eleven year old. Friendly owners and staff provided great service and explanations of the menu. Pleasant to dine in and very well packaged to go orders.",
   "Their house gumbo is the absolute best gumbo I've ever had! I'll add that the house gumbo comes with a kick so be prepared! The staff were attentive and my group never had to ask for refills. The wait time was around 5-10 minutes for the house gumbo and I know for sure that I will be back! The prices were pretty good, around $21 for my meal, and I believe that it was worth every penny! I can't wait to tell the rest of my coworkers and friends about this place!",
   "Delightfully impressed!  The food was as good as the service... EXCELLENT!  As an authentic Cajun from south Louisiana, the food here is very authentic and delicious. Places around here try to be a Cajun restaurant, but often fall short. Gumbo Girl nailed it!  It\u2019s nice to see a place that puts quality over getting your food fast..."

   "Have yet to have lunch here but dinner is amazing. I'd consider dinner here one of the best fine dining experiences in Jackson, comparable to Walker's, Char, and 1908 Provisions from a quality perspective, but more laid back. BYOB! Stop by Briarwood Mart Wine & Spirits (100 yards away) before you head there and let them know you are going to Crazy Cat for your 10% discount on a bottle of wine.",
   "Casual but high quality and reasonable prices.",
   "Amazing food, all locally sourced and so fresh every time!"

   "It\u2019s worth the fight for a parking space to enjoy an Elvis Panini. Peanut butter, bananas, and peanuts on warm panini bread are a delight! It\u2019s unusual enough to be delicious! The employees at Basil's are super nice and always try to please. You have to eat in the hallway after ordering, as the restaurant is a walk-up. If it\u2019s a nice day, you can sit outside. The only problem with eating here is the parking situation.....very limited!",

   "The food here is always so fresh! Great staff and so friendly. This is our favorite place to eat.",
   "Basil's is an excellent spot to get soups, salads and sandwiches. It is vegetarian friendly. I have not personally been to the location but I have had it for take out. I ordered the veggie panini  which is made on delicious foccacia bread. Was filled with cheese, Roma tomatoes, olive salad and pesto mayo. I have also tried their cesar salad and tomato basil soup which is very tasty. Great cookies for those that have a sweet tooth. Recommend checking this place out."

You have a variety of choices you can choose from and the staff is friendly and helpful in helping you decide. I got the beef over rice with the cabbage and chick peas. Everything was cooked wonderfully and definitely made a happy plate at the end. If you\u2019re in this part of town and want some great food, this is worth the trip.",
   "The food at Shiro's is so delicious, and incredibly authentic, and honestly you cannot beat the price. $12 plus tip got me a huge lunch platter of injera, beef, beets, lentils, and cabbage. They design the food with the idea of portability in mind too, I could have easily taken my lunch to go and had a lovely little picnic anywhere downtown. I love Ethiopian cuisine, and Shiro's was excellent. Their variety of flavors blended together beautifully to make every bite unique, but still delicious. Stop in for lunch and enjoy!",
   "Delicious. Small place in the middle of a building. It is not a sit-down restaurant, so you just walk up to the counter, look at what is there, order, and have it handed to you. They have you pay when you are done. Make sure you try their bread.\n\nSuper cool that this place even exists in Mississippi.",

   "Great food, good service and decent location, will return again",
   "We eat sushi all over the world. Sushi must be fresh and varied to be exceptional. Sakura Bana is owned and run by a Japanese family that knows and lives sushi. The choices and prices are very special. Service is good, parking adequate, ambiance is excellent. This restaurant has something for everyone in a family. The alcohol selection is appropriate and reasonably priced. Uni, toro, anagi, anago, etc are some of the treasures found.",
   "Nice presentation, awesome customer service, very reasonably priced. Downfall is they don't give you complimentary soup or salad like other sushi places. Our server asked if we'd like soup and salad so we said yes, little did we know that we'd be charged for it. Overall still a good experience, we'll definitely be back.",

   "Guy Fieri needs to make a visit this place is awesome! We came for breakfast and left FULL. We had the Sugars full breakfast grits bacon eggs and toast. The kids had waffles. My friend, being from up North exclaimed these are the best grits I've ever had. This coming from a \"Yankee\" I would have to say if I lived in the area it would definitely be a go to place. Wish we were going to be in town and have lunch here. All I can say is if you are here you need to stop, and Guy you need to stop in!!",
   "The 4.5+ rating is deceiving unfortunately. Our food was made to order, but the chicken on the biscuit tasted like a frozen patty that had been heated in the microwave, and the waffle is exactly the kind you get at a cheap cafeteria, bland, tough and disappointing. The chicken tenders with my waffle were tasty, but unfortunately not quite enough to counter the lackluster waffle. For as much as they charge for their food, it should taste freshly mixed and made, not freshly pulled from the freezer.",
   "After eating chicken tenders here, I cannot eat chicken tenders anywhere else because nothing else will be as tender and juicy as the ones made at Sugar's.  Their fries are also home made and some of the best I've ever tasted!  Seriously, Sugar's is one of the best places to eat for breakfast and lunch!  They put the \"soul\" in Soul Food!",
   "Best soul food I\u2019ve ever had. Ordered the chicken and waffles as well as the fried catfish, shrimp, and fries. Fried chicken batter was light, waffles were perfect, syrup was light and sweet. Fried catfish literally melted in my mouth, and even the fries were excellent. Stopped on our way to CO, but I\u2019d stop in Jackson again just for Sugar\u2019s!",
   "Had the pleasure of eating lunch from here.  When I say the food is absolutely incredible.  The flavors and taste was fresh and amazing.  The kool -aid is in a star class all by itself.  The owner was so nice\u263a\ufe0f I give this place more than 5+ stars!!!"

Every member of the staff is involved in making sure you are taken care of. The beverage selection is varied and upscale. The appetizers are delicious and uniquely displayed. The entrees are well presented and beyond expectation. The deserts are a necessity. They too are beautifully displayed, unique, and delicious. I was there for dinner, but others told me I must come back for breakfast and lunch, which I plan on doing.",

The staff was on top of everything from keeping our cups of coffee and water full to answering all of our questions. The atmosphere in there is charming, made us feel like we stepped into a classy NOLA style place from the 30's.

Try all of them! \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe won ton tuna nachos were great, nachos wasn't oily at all and the seaweed salad was great on it. It was a pretty light dish for nachos.

   "Posted on behalf of Ms. Banks, who does not have a google account.\u2014 \u201cYesterday at Thai Time Thai and Sushi Restaurant, I had a very disturbing experience that was very unprofessional, unsettling, disheartening and embarrassing to say the least. After purchasing three to-go orders and one to-go buffet around lunch-time, as I frequently do, (spending over $40). As I waited for my to-go entrees after already paying and fixing the to-go buffet plate, an employee\u2014both a man and woman, approached me mentioning something about the buffet.  I did not clearly understand exactly what they were saying at first, but the lady then said that someone from the kitchen said that I put something in my mouth while at the buffet. Appalled at this accusation, I immediately, calmly told her that did not occur, in fact, I had chewing gum in my mouth at the time! Yes, she apologized, but the damage had already been done. It makes me wonder that if I had been a different person, or looked a different way would I have been approached, accused and humiliated in such a manner. I have decided that I will not patronize a business that thinks so little of me, to think that I have not the least of manners and would stand at a public buffet at a restaurant and put food into my mouth. I started to request a refund, but I had already decided that it would be the last penny that they would ever get from me.  It is so unfortunate that this type of establishment is even present in our city of Jackson, MS\u201d",
   "Buffet is small, but everything was flavorful and delicious, cheap and affordable too! If you want a Thai buffet, definitely give this place a try.",
   "Possibly the best Thai food in Jackson. My coworkers and I always visit here when ever we visit Jackson. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. A personal favorite of mine is the Crunchy Chicken! Thai Time was fantastic! We shared the vegi egg rolls and Boom Boom Shrimp, that tastes a lot like Bonefish's shrimp. Delicious. Also, the Yellow Curry Chicken was fantastic. My six-year old nephew loved it and he's a picky eater. He ate some just after coming from hibachi, which he loves. That's how great this place is. The server was great and management too. My favorite Thai restaurant in the South so far.",
   "We drove there from Memphis, TN as part of a road trip.  We have visited Thai restaurants in Nashville, TN and Little Rock, AR already.  I have never been to Jackson so it\u2019s time for a road trip.  We ordered shrimp Pad Thai, shrimp basil fried rice, som tum, grilled chicken, sticky rice and one more basil fried rice to go.  We didn\u2019t order any dessert just two drinks.  The bill came to $83 with tip.  The food was not bad but the price was too high.  I didn\u2019t like the way they cooked the basil fried rice neither.  The portion of the food for this price tags only lasted for two meals, I thought that was outrageous.  The Thai waitress knew us from a Thai restaurant in Springfield, MO and she made a rude comment in the kitchen about me and my husband by thinking that I could not hear her.  I do not appreciate that.  I will not return to this place again.  I rather visit PF chang in Memphis which costs less and has better food than going back to this place.",
   "Look, I am a steak and potato guy, but this restaurant is great.  A little help, but I picked the fried rice and shrimp-#1 for spice level. Delicious!!!! A gem that is hidden and the service was great...clean too."

   "Absolutely amazing food and friendly staff. Truly great Big Rhonda Challenge. Can\u2019t wait to try it!",
   "The herbs, seasoning, the ratio of fat used in the meatloaf was perfect, not one dry bite! I've never been a fan of bbq sauce on my meatloaf or bbq sauce at all, so I'm glad to see that it's more of a tomato base sauce, more sweet than tangy. My green beans were fine, not much taste, same with the mac n cheese. The cheese had a slightly grainy nutty texture, which I find to be strangely addictive! I love my mac n cheese that way, not too much taste, not overwhelming in cheese, just nicely coated. The meatloaf has a lot of taste, so I thought pairing it with the green beans and mac n cheese kept it the star of the dish.",
   "Stupid good burger. Maybe the best burger on Earth. Limited hours, but quick service. We walked through the door at 12:30 and had our food at our table by 12:40. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it's clean and modern. Eat a Wagyu burger with Swiss and mushrooms when you're ready to change your life.",
   "Excellent food, beautifully plated!\n\nThe building may look like it used to when it was that cafeteria-style BBQ place, but the menu and \"vibe\" are much better. I definitely like the changes!\n\nThe meatloaf \"Blue-plate special\" looked as beautiful as the pictures on this website and it tasted even better than it looked. We also tried the Wagyu beef and a sandwich. All were delicious."

Greek fries are awesome.. pizzas  are  awesome...dishes are put together nicely with their own special touch...Great food...Headed back to try out the salads.. Definitely worth the stop if u love Mediterranean..",
   "Alpos is the bomb and pet friendly. Excellent service.  When the kitchen backs up, they stop taking orders. Not a problem here. It's worth the wait. Sit on the patio or visit the area shops until they start taking orders again. Usually last for about 10 minutes.",
   "You get great Mediterranean food here. I little pricey but wasn't disappointed. My daughter said the hummus was the best she has ever tasted. The Gyro pizza is also recommended. Friendly staff made the whole experience memorable, wish we could afford to eat there every week!",
   "Love this place so much!  The Greek wings and creamy feta dipping sauce is AMAZING. The wine and beer selection is great, too.  The fact that it has a bright and airy atmosphere INSIDE along with an option to eat on the cheerful terrace with the Highland Village fountains makes it a fantastic place to eat all year round.  They also have a killer happy hour! Frose all around!",
   "Beautiful location for a casual date night. Really wanted to try the fros\u00e8 but they were out! The sweet waiter had me try something else! That was so kind of him!  So got the frozen blood orange drink.......it was divine. I got the lamb wrap filled with tender juicy lamb and fresh vegetables on a pita bread. My husband tried the chicken pizza and was good too. Great staff, cute location, delicious food, and divine drinks. We both had a good time together. Definitely going back!"

   "We ate Valentine's dinner at Crechale's. Fortunately, little has changed. Still USDA Prime steaks and fresh seafood, fried or broiled. We love the broiled scallops in a white wine butter sauce. I add a little fresh lemon and it is seafood heaven. If you want to have a selection of seafood, the seafood platter is available broiled or fried. The steaks are basically plain grilled prime steaks. Prime steaks are well marbled and need little seasoning beyond salt and pepper and maybe a little butter. There are other restaurants for marinated choice steaks and elaborate sauces and toppings. Our eleven year old said that the scallops were delicious.",
   "Fresh flounder,  5 star service,  Bob on deck.",
   "Had not been here since the 1990's so I was back in town for a wedding & thought I'd give it a try. Still so GOOD! Nothing had changed since I was there. Same jukebox with the same great country music, same curtains, & the best part was the same great food. Staff very attentive for sure. I had the scallops. Couldn't believe they gave me twelve!! Had double salad rather than a baked potato with the wonderful comeback sauce. Could just about drink it through a straw. Love it!! Next time, I won't wait so long to go back!!!",
   "grew up in Jackson and I first started eating there in the middle 70's.I have since moved to Nashville but when I came home for Christmas I made a special point to dine there again because I had such fond memories of it in the past. I was delighted to see that nothing had changed a bit since the 70's and I doubt since 1956. It is such an iconic example of a business model that was done right and continues to be done right. It is Saturday night and I have no doubt there is a line forming outside their door as I type this",
   "Old school food and atmosphere. Don't go here expecting a light meal or vegetarian options. Go here for a birthday and get the onion rings. "

They have very good homestyle/southern style cooking, with several vegetables for sides. I highly recommend. This is a 'must' place to visit. Also they have Extremely sweeeet lemonade and tea (some people may understand what we call 'southern sweet' or 'ghetto sweet', so be cautious...its so good and sweet that you maybe could pour it on your pancakes !",

I have a family of 4 so I expect to pay hefty for what we enjoy but if its a bother, I will not return. Plus word of mouth goes a long way.",

   "The Poke bowls are AMAZING! The tiramisu at the deli was the best I've had! My mom loved her bagel sandwich from the deli. Love this place. I'm going come all the time!",
   "I was stoked to check this place out after seeing it on Instagram (@cultivationjxn). It surpassed expectations. The interiors were completely up to date and provided such a positive communal space for eating that had adequate seating selections for different size groups, making 8 people feel as comfortable as 2. There was a dining area separate of the main hall and was quieter if you wanted a calmer meal, but I recommend enjoying the atmosphere of where the vendors are. \n\nThe choices of style of meal were superb and varied, not just BETWEEN vendors, but in vendors themselves. Each of the sub-shops had a great selection of menu items related to their \u201ctheme\u201d but they were quite varied, bringing truth to the food hall\u2019s name...every item felt cultivated. \n\nAside from the wonderful food, there was a coffee shop serving fantastic brews, and a bar fully stocked with both alcohol and friendly staff. \n\nPRICE: TALK ABOUT WORTH IT. None of the food was in the least bit expensive or overpriced. I was actually quite shocked by how accessible the items here are, given the chic look of the establishment, but the quality is great and the service follows suit. Both still and sparkling water are available on tap (with actual glasses) for free, and empty plates are stocked aplenty around the joint for splitting or sharing meal items with others. \n\nAbsolutely nothing but positive reviews on this place and everything it presents. Can\u2019t wait to go back and try other items!",
   "It was amazing. We ate at Local Honey and ordered the Avocado Toast. It was delicious and definitely recommend it! Check the pictures!",
   "Great atmosphere, full of food counters with an eclectic selection of food styles to choose from. Pictured is a NY Lox \"sandwich\"from Ariella's NY Deli. It's an everything bagel with Nova Lox (salmon that's been cured and smoked and is thinly sliced when served), with tomato, red onion, capers and a \"schmear\" (thin layer) of cream cheese.\nIn NYC this would be known as a bagel all the way....\nI will suggest to them, when I go again, that they toast the bagel, or at least offer it as an option... Bagels in NY are always offered to be toasted and are usually served that way.\nWill edit post shortly with other pictures.",
   "I like the idea of the food hall. It's essentially a food court on a higher scale. For a family with different tastes this is a nice option. We tried three different restaurants on our visit.  All three were very good. The crepes seemed to be everyone's favorite. It was not too crowded, especially for a Saturday night. Overall good experience, nice staff."

   "While the food is good the only exceptional service that I receive begins and ends at the hostess station. On another occasion as I made my order to go, hoping to escape the dine in \"service\", it still happens. Dealing with someone that will make it very obvious that they do not want to be there. I guess at the time, as the order was not for me, I did sympathize. As for the bar far be it from me to question the actual margaritas there. I do, however, find them lacking in the preparation of other mixed drinks. Well... in all honesty I've never had their margaritas anyway. For example the barkeep prepared me a gin and tonic... with seltzer water. Once again though the food is delicious"

Absolutely dead when we went and the rest of the market was closed which makes for an intimidating and cofusing walk-in. Employees were prepping for other days and 2 of the 3 tables in the tiny space were taken up by them. Absolutely not a restaurant you can sit to enjoy breakfast at.

   "This is a hidden gem for the locals working downtown, but it is also just off Hwy 55. The food is fresh and the vegetables are Southern but creative. For lunch, they have two or more choices for entrees, but it is so hard to choose from the delicious sides, I often just have a vegetable plate. As for crime, Jackson has it, but the downtown area is well patrolled and I have no problem going here by my senior self.",
   "What can I say, they have the best grits and that bacon... delicious!\n Food 5 \nService 5\nAtmosphere 5",
   "I don\u2019t write reviews; but, this place left such an overwhelmingly sour taste in my mouth, it was hard to taste the cooking. $32 for a bitter middle aged woman who can\u2019t take responsibility for her own simple error behind the line. Been in service industry for several years and have never treated a customer with such attitude and poor social demeanor over what can be easily fixed. Time for a career change to \u201cthe owner\u201d"

   "Wow Man, this place is great, I went there for Lunch and was immediately greeted and seated. The place had a hip and rustic vibe to it, which I really liked, The owner was very friendly and asked where I am originally from and placed an Indian flag at my table, which was such a nice gesture.\nFood was served fast and tasted great, I was a nice experience I will definitely be returning soon. Will recommend to anyone looking for Mexican food in Jackson Downtown",
   "You absolutely must try the Chicken Jalisico. After a long day, this was the rich hearty Mexican dish that I was craving. The place was a little empty for a Saturday night but that was certainly not a reflection of the quality of the food. The entire table was extremely satisfied with our orders. Service was prompt and the staff very friendly.",

   "Went here on lunch and it was absolutely amazing! Our food was delicious and the staff were as friendly as could be. They even tried to teach us how to use some instruments but we\u2019re just terrible at music. Loved the experience, loved the food, 10/10 would recommend and come back again!",
   "This restaurant was an excellent example of southern hospitality! The food was flavorful and absolutely delicious. The service was prompt. By far one of the best atmospheres (great photo opportunity)."

   "We stopped for lunch at Piccadilly, our first time and unfortunately, our last, because we were on a bus tour and live on the West Coast. The selection was outstanding. I ordered the fish almondine. The portion was huge, covered the whole plate. The price was $9.99 and included two sides, and a wonderful selection of breads plus drink. If I lived closer, this would be one of my favorite places. Tasty, fresh and reasonably priced.",

   "I sent my friends to this restaurant with my highest recommendations. I visit this restaurant often. I get very good feedback from my friends. The the cooking is appetizing and the crew is generous and cooperative. always when we go to this place we enjoy a splendid time.  warmly recommended.",
   "If you like Southern \"comfort food,\" then you'll probably like this cafeteria-style dining experience. The serving line and dining room have recently been remodeled, with new tables and chairs. Some partitions were removed, giving the room a more open feeling. Serving-line staff now wear white tunics, giving then a more upscale look. There is a room which can be reserved for private gatherings. Previously, it was defined by accordian partitions. Now, it is entirely glass enclosed. I like the seafood gumbo!",
   "Baltimore approves! Shout out to the sweet manager Mary and her pleasant, hardworking staff; Jackie, Romeo, Stephanie, Ted etc. Thank you for my experience. This is definitely my go to when I visit again. I rarely do breakfast or buffets for that matter but, I would make an exception here. The welcoming, the food, the meet and greets to make sure you have everything you need; this is definitely an experience and gem here Mississippi. Everything is fresh (fruits and veggies) you have your made to orders (omelets, pancakes, French toast and waffles), or your classic continental breakfast (,cereals, muffins and yogurts) all in all there's something here for everyone. I will be trying the lunch next visit. I highly recommend!"

We sat in the sushi area and ordered from the Hibachi grill. Food was prepared flawlessly and cooked to perfection. We were quickly seated and had no complaints about the food or staff. my Tea glass was kept full and they were very attentive.",

   "The food was excellent. We were there on lunch, so there wasn't much of a Hibachi show, which is normal for those crowded times. We also waited 20 minutes for each beverage refill, the waiter would simply disappear. Will be back for the food, hope the service gets better. Family and I had a great visit. Staff was very helpful and attentive. We sat in the booth area and ordered from the habatchi grill. Food was very good and just as we ordered. This is our favorite Japanese Steak house..",

   "One word: OBSESSED!\n\nHands down, my new favorite of all favorite spots in Jackson, MS. Fine & Dandy has stolen my heart, and I'll never be the same! The views, the decor, the Golden Hour menu, the service w/southern hospitality, and my Lord-- the food is amazing!\n\nHubs and I stopped for lunch, tried as much as we could possibly stomach, and loved it all. The Purist & Grandma Chick are manna from heaven! The meats are cooked to perfection and the fries are legit. I wanted more (softer, maybe some sweet or sourdough action) from the buns they serve, but I can deal. Not a deal breaker at all.\n\nThe also love the attention to detail here. It's as if nothing-- absolutely nothing was an afterthought, down to the check presentation, staff uniforms, and restroom wallpaper. (I love that ish)\n\nHats off to the chef & design team! I'm #FangirlingHARD and super impressed!",
   "The menu is a limited but the quality of the food is excellent. The burgers are succulent, fresh and a perfect portion. The cocktails and milkshakes are excellent. I highly recommend the hot toddy - got rid of my cold which was an added bonus The tater tots with white truffle and trout caviar are interesting but the dill is overpowering. The katsu burger whilst different could pack a bigger punch",
   "We had a great \u2018date night\u2019 at this restaurant.  The food was delicious, service was courteous,  and the menu was the best one I have ever read.   We tried a new beer, and some wine though they specialize in far more complicated mixes.  We tried the baked cheese appetizer ....  yum!   the chicken and wafflez (like no other!).  And the dinner special which was a snapper plate.  All dishes had very unique flavor and served on dandy china plates.  We were pleased to spend our evening here.  \nThe atmosphere inside is hip and spaced close together.  We chose to sit outside on the  porch where there are outdoor couches with short tables which  provide a quieter experience where private conversations could be had in any weather.  These couches are also great for families with kids - Plenty of room for movement.  \nIf you like this review, tap the thumbs up.",
   "I was pleased to have the District at Eastover develop in the last few years as it is just a short car ride away from my home. One thing that sets them apart from the other restaurants in this area is service! I have always been very pleased with each and every one of the people who have served me during my many visits to this wonderful establishment. Now to the food.... (and drinks). When it comes to appetizers, you really cannot go wrong: Dad Bod tots, regular tots, Fries (it is served with Mayo, so if that's not your thing, ask for ketchup), and the pimento cheese is fantastic.",
   "Food was basic after hours type food. Everything we had was good but did have rather long ticket times, especially considering it wasn't busy. Server was very mediocre - more like an order taker at a fast food joint. Atmosphere was very pleasant. Not too loud, not too quiet. This was my first time there and would most likely visit again next time in the Jackson area."

   "My first time here and I will be coming back with friends !  Gluten free options and I ordered something not realizing it might contain gluten, the server informed me of the possibility and offered to let me order another side.  Wonderful customer service.  Everything tasted so fresh and original.  Loved the chicken wrap.  Loaded with chicken and black beans.   \nThe tea fresh and awesome coffee. Plenty of room for seating.  Area was clean.  The tables were constantly being cleaned up as soon as someone left.    Bakery products look delish !",
   "We have loved to stop at this bakery and independent book store for many years as we pass through Jackson, Mississippi. Yummy fresh baked goods, breads, cookies, pastries, sandwiches, soups. We had the grilled cheese Panini and avocado toast. We bought cheese cake, bread, cookies to go home. It\u2019s always worth a stop and a great place to catch up on work and take a break. Spacious, light and bright. My friend is an avid reader and he loves the bookstore upstairs and says there are all kinds of things he never sees elsewhere.",
   "We decided to stop here while driving through Jackson for breakfast. The service was fast, staff was very kind, welcoming, and helpful. The food was amazing!! I had a breakfast quiche, which I've never seen served before. They also had a great selection of desserts and coffee. It's a great place if you like books. Lemuria,  cozy bookstore, is on the second floor! Would absolutely come back again.",
   "Stopped here for the bookstore nearby, found myself lured to this restaurant (by the wonderful smells). With the amazing displays of baked goods and delicious food I will definitely want to come back. The staff were super friendly and my food was ready within minutes!",
   "I was invited here for my birthday, and I loved it. I never knew it existed. Haha. I saw it a few days later rolling through I-55, and I was like wow that looks like a bank from the old days. I got the po boy catfish with Gumbo soup. It's a very wonderful place and the people are lively. Thank you Broad Street for a cool birthday lunch."

It was strongly suggested by an employee, along with the champagne vinaigrette. It did not disappoint. Huge serving enough for 2 days. Crabcakes warm and flavorful, the croutons were so large I thought they were grilled  chicken bits. Staff friendly and knowledgeable about what they are serving. Restaurant clean. Parking a bit of a challenge. Major let down. The restaurant downtown closes at 2:30 on weekdays. Not open on the weekends. Enjoy!",
   "Food was freshly prepared, service was great and staff was friendly, some of the options in the menu were not available, that made us a bit disappointed but besides that other things were great, will visit again",
   "We were in Downtown Jackson, Mississippi today riding around and looking for somewhere to eat that we had never been to, well Basil's Downtown was where we ended up, and I am glad we did... We didn't read the hours on the door when we walked in,  we  just went in and walked up to the counter, well it turns out they close at 2 p.m. and it was 1:55 when we walked in. We  honestly would have went somewhere else if we had known it was their closing time, but no one at the counter mentioned it, and they patiently answered all of our questions about items on the menu until we made up our minds.\n   I ended up ordering the daily special, which was a Prime Rib Sandwich with Gravy for dipping, and I also ordered a cup of their Corn & Crab Chowder. When my meal arrived at our table a little while later, of course the 1st thing I tried was the Corn & Crab Chowder, and there was no disappointment there, as it was really good,  so of course I moved on to my sandwich, which I immediately dunked in the gravy, now this is where things all of the sudden had a WOW factor, as the gravy was by and far the star of the show, with the hint of wine not only being an unexpected surprise, but also making it one of the best gravies that I have ever had in a restaurant. I cannot lie, I liked the gravy so much that after finishing  my sandwich and seeing that there was still 1/2 a bowl of gravy left, I just grabbed my soup spoon and finished it off like it was a soup.... Not only was the food great here, the service was too, as we were not rushed, nor made to feel like we were inconveniencing the staff, and actually it was the exact opposite, as they were not only attentive, but also very friendly... I may not be in Jackson very often, but Basil's will now be one of my goto restaurants when I am...",

I couldn't afford a trip to the beach this summer so bikini week at Twin Peaks has been a little blessing. Praise the Lord and pass the cold beer",

We asked for her name when we were tabbing out and she told us her name was Shell. She asked if everything was okay and we told her we wanted her to know how we very appreciative of her making sure we left happy. We want to give these 5 stars to her and let her know we will be coming regularly because of the experience she gave us.",

Our food came out at all kind of crazy times, no napkins were given although asked many times.  I honestly don't think I would return here."
