   "Went the first of March and so enjoyed the visit. Since it was cool out almost all those animals were out and the one who need warmth were inside exhibits. It made the visit really enjoyable to be able to see so many animals. I will say good walking, enclosed shoes are important here as the walkways are rough and broken in places (I fell once) and this early there was a lot of snow melt with flooded walkways making that not an enjoyable experience. Overall loved it!",
   "I had no idea there would be a zoo in North Dakota! Our family visited it was a lot of fun. Great zoo, lots neat animals to see and great meeting rooms. Bring your sunscreen if it's during summer time",
   "This zoo was amazing!  Coming from Wichita,is where the Sedgwick County Zoo is phenomenal, I found this zoo refreshing and unique.  It was amazing to see all the North American animals along with some exotics.  My wife and I will be bringing our kids with us in a couple of years to this zoo.",
   "The zoo is okay.  It's small and the admission fee is very reasonable.  Good for some entertainment.  A lot of small enclosures which could do with some renovations.  Park is clean and well maintained.  Lots of shade. The tigers were the best part.",
   "Went to go to take photos with Santa which we were led to think were free. Paid $19 to get in, saw a sign with the prices on it for pictures $10-25 (depending on what you wanted). Decided it wasn't worth almost $40 to take a photo with Santa, so I requested a refund for the zoo entry since we hadn't gone in. The lady stated she can't give refunds and that I would have to come back another day to get one. She then gave us a Supervisor's # to call, but when we tried to call, it wasn't an actual number. Moral of the story, don't try to get refunds, as they will make you jump through hoops to get it. I did get it in the end."

A great deal of educational and historical material   allowing for a wonderful experience. Ample parking and easily accessible from the highway. Well worth the detour. Thank you and good use of your $.",

   "Very interesting place! Was so cool to look around the exhibits and see all the stuff they have to offer. Really cool experience. Really cool artifacts. Overall ready awesome place!",
   "This place gets better everytime I visit. It's very accurate with some of the exhibits. But a great place to visit.",
   "1 to 6 hours of awesome! You can whip through this museum and still get something out of it. Or get lost in large warehouse-like rooms filled with great exhibits that continually provided organization, flow, and detail for me to understand and digest. Artifacts everywhere and I was told only 4% of what they have is on display at any one time. \n\nI spent about 4 hours total here and was most impressed with their North Dakota and WW1 exhibit. So interesting to put it in perspective and see how it had affected the people of ND. Also had so many artifacts that soldiers had brought back from war. \n\nDont miss the petrified wood and natural cannonballs in the garden area.  And it is all free to see. Thank you North Dakota!"

   "This place was so much fun! The ground in the park was rubber and felt springy to walk on. The park had a lot of different play equipment both accessible and non it started low to the ground and went up higher as you climb through. It kept us busy for a long time! Cant wait to stop by again!",

Dr Dan had the same treatment recommendation but much more reasonably priced and we love the staff! They are super friendly and caring. They truly care about their patients and want Ortho treatment to be a positive experience. My girls got their braces off in May and they actually miss going to see Dr Dan every couple weeks!",

I feel like I know all the details of how this process is going to go and won't have anything to worry about down the road!!! Thank you so much Dr. Dan and Danielle for being so awesome with Britt and I!!!",
   "I want to thank Dr.Dan and his amazing staff! Since day one they have made me feel so welcome and part of their DK family! It was a bitter sweet day today, as I got my braces off. I was thinking of all the faces that I will miss seeing on early Monday mornings. Although, I will be a guest in his office as my children will be future patients, giving me even more of an opportunity to continue the friendships.  You do it right!!",
   "Just got braces on our 13 yr old daughter today and couldn\u2019t be more impressed with the dr. and staff at DK Orthodontics!  So friendly and helpful from day 1 with the initial consult.  They have been so kind in all their interactions w us, explaining thoroughly any questions we\u2019ve had.  They remember us each time and ask how things are going.  THANK U, DK ORTHODONTICS, for everything!  Excited to see our daughters amazing smile in a couple of years \ud83d\ude01"

I don't mind ordering at the bar, but there was not enough staff resulting in a wait every time I went up because they were too busy doing other things to take my order.  And this was mid-afternoon on a weekday!  Food was good (could use more smoke flavor) with generous portions.  Nice facilities.",
   "Nice atmosphere and good craft beer. Some of the food options on the menu are unique and fun. All that I have tried, taste pretty good, but none of it has been hot. Good flavors but the food is always just warm to warm-ish. My friends all feel the same way and some of them I have never been there with. Unfortunately if it stays consistent like that I will probably stop going there altogether.",
   "They moved to a new Bismarck location in the Fall, and now they have a ton more room, and live music almost every night it seems! Just had the Taylor Made barbecue for the first time tonight (Chopped Brisket Sandwich) and holy smokes is it delicious! The Mac n Cheese will blow your mind too. Beer, as always, is on point. Will definitely be stopping by more this spring/summer!",
   "Best place for live music in town. Great beer. Good BBQ food selection. I love being able to order at the counter - it seems to speed up things. The expanded size is a welcome addition, but even this place fills up very fast and it can be hard to find seats for a larger group if come too late on a busy night. It's neat seeing the owner(s) hanging out here with their friends and having a good time - it speaks more highly of a place. There's an excellent, varied, and eclectic group of music here which is very welcome. I wish that when bands are taking their breaks, there would be no music played instead of background music on their radio. The nice thing about the old place was the silence between sets to catch up on conversation. The bread part of the BBQ sandwiches could be better - it seems too thick, not soft enough, and not hot.",
   "My girlfriend wouldn\u2019t even kiss me after a couple of your golden ales. I almost bought some kona golden ales, which I enjoy immensely, but instead but was like well, laughing sun golden ales will be similar. \nWrong. Wrong. Tastes like keystone light gave up."

They will even drop you off up river so you can kayak back down again! The camp site was well keep and with plenty of space for two tents. The fire ring was also cleaned out, so we didn't have to worry about too much ash inside it. We went for a walk on one of the trails, and the view was really beautiful. We got quite a few ticks on the walk, but we were able to get rid of them all without much trouble. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun camping trip.",
   "I have visited all of the state parks in North Dakota save one. (Graham's Island). My favorite so far is Cross Ranch. I have camped there  numerous times. For newcomers, it's a little tricky to find. It's off the beaten path for sure. But it's worth it.\n   The park is divided Into two sections about three miles apart. They are connected by a trail. The smaller section cannot accommodate large RVs. 20ft. max. However, I like the smaller section better. (Also known as Sanger campground). It's very close to the Missouri River. If you like to go rafting it's perfect. There's even a rafting company in nearby Washburn, that rents rafts and will even pick you up downstream.\n   The Park is open year-round with plenty of activities. There's a nice trail for cross-country skiing in the winter or hiking in the summer.\n   If you're a fisherman, the Missouri River has plenty of fish. Although I am not a fisherman, I heard there's walleye! I don't like to fish but I love to eat them! Yum!\n   The last time I visited, there were upgrades taking place at Sanger. Water was being installed. Electricity is available as well.  There are vault toilets. Althoughl Sanger was considered primitive, that may not be the case now.\n   The park is well-maintained and the toilets are clean.\nI think the best thing I like about the park is the location. Next to the Missouri River, it's awesome. I'm not the type of person that likes to go out on big water but I like the Missouri River and I'm not afraid of it. It has a slow-moving current and is very picturesque even if you don't want to get into the water. I've heard that there are bald eagles living along the river.\n   If you're the type of person wanting to get away from it all, Cross ranch is the place to go!",
   "We come here every year for the Bluegrass Festival. Good place to camp with clean facilities and a playground for the kids. Had to put up with the ticks (and tree worms this year) but still had fun.",
   "We love camping here especially in the fall. Lots of wildlife and great trails. Friendly and helpful Park staff. Everything is well maintained",

The view is amazing and it is a wonderful place to stop and enjoy the peace and quiet, and eat your lunch. \n\nSalem Sue is every inch as big as she looks. A great landmark, well kept, and not commercialized. A free will donation suffices to keep Sue in good shape. \n\nTake the time to visit Sue if you are in the neighborhood. I wish I had done so years ago. I won't pass her by next time.",

The artist was Dave Oswald and the construction was done by Sculpture Mfg. Co in\u00a0La Crosse, Wisconsin.\u00a0The statue stands\u00a038 feet (12\u00a0m)\u00a0high and\u00a050 feet (15\u00a0m)\u00a0long. It sits on School Hill near\u00a0Interstate 94\u00a0off exit 127 S and can be viewed for several miles.",
   "If you're traveling as a tourist on 94, there's no excuse not to take fifteen minutes of your time and drive up to see Salem Sue. A quick walk up the path gets you a fun photo op with the world's largest Holstein statue and a great view of the surrounding land. If you have a few minutes extra, walk all the way to the top of the hill and get a stunning 360 degree panorama of the area surrounding New Salem.\n\nFree to everyone, but drop a buck or two in the donation box for Sue's upkeep."

   "Really enjoyed it, very informative.\nI, also, enjoyed walking to the river on the Lewis and Clark Legacy Trail. \nThe information that I found said the trail was 2.2 miles, that's 1 way, end to end; I went  a bit past the riverboat and back and went 3.5 miles. It's a very nice, easy walk with some elevation; there's, also, a Frisbee Golf course. \nThe entire visitor center was well worth the stop.\nMake sure you go to the Mandan Fort, also.",
   "Great museum full of information and stories about Lewis and Clark and their journey out west."

   "A great visit to though historic site and re-creation of Ft Mandan.  The tour costs $8.00 per person and covers the Interpretive Center as well as Ft. Mandan.  The ladies providing the tour were fantastic, very knowledgeable and good communicators. Don't be shy if driving a big RV and towing a car. There is a turn around loop next to Ft Mandan.  No problem with a 42 motor home towing a car.  I parked on the side of the road facing out.",
   "It was nice. But, the fact that is was a reproduction and at a different place was a bit of a let down. But, I understand about it being lost. The inside rooms were really nice. They gave an insight to their lives in the area.",
   "Unique fort replica (@2 miles from Lewis & Clark Interpretive Crt and museum) with history of Lewis & Clark who wintered here from 1804-1805.  The museum covers ND history, several local Indian tribes & Lewis and Clark explorers.  No discounts but only $8 pp for museum & fort tours.  Great gift shop.  Park Rangers are very nice & helpful.",
   "We arrived after 3:00 pm, which was the last docent-led tour; however, one of the docents took us on his own tour. It was informative, and I leard a few things that I did not glean from reading \"Undaunted Courage\" or by watching the PBS documentary on Lewis and Clark.",
   "Awesome recreation of Lewis and Clark's winter fort. Great tour guide gave a great lesson and answered all our questions."

Fascinating earth house model, beautiful grassy area with visible mounds where these homes used to stand (and had collapsed), extremely helpful and kind rangers, and a great museum with lots of interesting bits of information.  We even got to see some archeologists in action while we were there!  Lovely and interesting place I would highly recommend to everyone!",

I was skeptical at such a bold claim but, they were right and Zorells did not disappoint! Tim Jr helped us pick out the ring and he was very knowledgable and helpful! They have a great selection by the way! They made sure the ring came in before we took off to Hawii! After she said yes in Hawii, she did the usual things for brides and lost weight. Little did I know the a diet would change her finger and ring size. Zorells has been great about resizing the ring and has not charged us for it ever! (We resized the ring 3 times, every time smaller) Zorells has done a outstanding job with the ring on all fronts! I would strong encourage you to go here! (Picture does not do the ring justice!

All they want in there is old outdated artists that would be better off at a casino or a county fair. When they do have great bands like, Avenged Sevenfold, Five Finger Death Punch ect, they act like they're afraid of them.

We recently visited there with my husband's parents and our children.It's so fun to look for trolls, and our youngest enjoyed roleplaying the Three Billy Goats Gruff across the bridges! I love the natural wood smell inside the Gol Stave Church - and the carvings are intricate and beautiful. It's a very peaceful place, and the volunteers I've met there have been very friendly and knowledgeable. One of my favorite statues is the one of Hans Christian Andersen. You can see some hints of his stories in the statue, like a duckling and a pair of scissors. Sometimes the sauna door is open so you can see the sunlight streaming through the beautiful stained glass windows. Don't forget to check out the Heritage House a short walk down the road from the cabin - I overlooked it the first time I visited the park.\nThe gift shop area is fairly small, and doubles as the Visitor's Center for Minot, but there is still a great variety of trinkets, t-shirts, gifts, books, and treats. Definitely check out the toffee chocolate bar from Iceland; it's one of the most expensive chocolate bars I've ever bought, but soooooo very worth it! (Actually, don't  - if there's more demand the price will go up and I'll only be able to get it at Christmas!)"

There are two pay binoculars here to use to see the buffalo nearby is desired.\nParking is free, we parked near the chapel and I believe I saw a handicap spot here as well and perhaps near the museum as well?  Some folks just drove to the end of the town, made a u-turn and drove back.  It wasn't too busy when we visited.",
   "This is the second time we have stopped in on our travels. Love being able to see the buffalo and enjoy the walk around the town. The museum has a great little free library and the tour inside is very informative. We really enjoy the walk around the Frontier Village also."

Check or cash are accepted as well with a drop box. No cell phone needed with this method.

   "We went here with a group of 6 and did the mafia room. It was way to many people for this room. The game maker for the room was not a very pleasant person. She was very unfriendly whenever we tried to joke with her and when she gave any clues they were usually delivered in a very condescending manner. At the end we laughed about how many times she just said rude comments like \"Does anyone in this group know how to open a lock?\" And \"Uhhh you have to hand it to me...\" I feel like this is a great addition to Bismarck and I hope I continues to improve. It could start with training the staff to be a little more upbeat and friendly or at least able to give information in a less rude manner. I've done multiple escape rooms in Minneapolis and each time the game maker is the person who made a huge difference in how enjoyable the experience is. It's not a good feeling to already feel lost then look over and see this unfriendly person judging you. I will also add that one of the boxes was missing a lock and the employee straight up told us that if she hadn't forgotten the lock we would have never escaped. She wanted me to include her name in the review because she apparently gets bonuses based on reviews but I don't think she wants her name on this one.",
   "We escaped the Z.M.B. Virus Trials featuring Jordan as The Patient in 51:16! Super fun and great puzzles! The Patient was funny and scary but not freeky. Had a great time and recommend Trapped in Bismarck to anyone who likes puzzles or games!",
   "Highly recommend Trapped if your looking for something fun to do with a group! Our Guide was great, gave us clues just when we needed them, we didn't \"escape\" but she did walk us through it in the end and explained what we missed, ect. Great place, great staff!",
   "We did a room one night and had so much fun we went back the next day and did two more!! Jordan was fantastic and we were able to escape all 3 rooms!! Would definitely go back!! Go Team Megadesk!!!",
   "I came here with a group of friends and had so much fun. All the puzzles were fun to figure out And the storyline was cool. Our guide Anna was hilarious and fun. She helped us pass the room and made us laugh along the way. I definitely will be coming back here again"

   "One of my favorite places in Bismarck. Great for weekends. Usually pretty light on bat traffic. The summer you can hang out outside.",
   "One of the nicest bars in town. Decor is like the San Francisco area, and they have fire pits to keep warm outside at night. Plus the view is great, not many other bars let see all of downtown. But this place is limited by the bathroom selection. Durring peak hours their is usually a line, and the extra bathrooms are down the elevator (or stairs is your in a hurry).\nEdit, there's another bathroom on the left hand side. Five stars!"

There are lions, tigers, bears,giraffes, monkeys, lemurs, penguins, some local wildlife(wolves, buffalo, etc) and much more! It's in Roosevelt park, which is a beautiful park and also has a public pool. Highly recommend!"

The environment in Longhorns is quiet and rustic and more sophisticated, but it doesn't make up for the amount of blah-ness on a menu. Even the burgers are blah. The two stand out items on their menu is The Longhorn and the onion petals.",

   "The food is fantastic and the staff was friendly. So why the three star review? Cleanliness of the restaurant. The eating area was clean and tidy but the bathrooms, on multiple occasions, were overly dirty. I understand that it's something that is hard to keep up on but definitely ruins your appetite. Any time my friends and I have gone here, at least one of us gets sick. It could just be coincidence but it never happens at any other restaurant we go to.",
   "Awesome food. Great service and friendly staff. Certainly a must try if you are in the neighborhood.",
   "To tell the truth, was very disappointed in the quality and quantity of the food. Most containers were empty and the area was dirty. I gave a three instead of a two because of the cook. He was very personable and entertaining.",
   "Now this is good food. Load up a bowl with everything you think is tasty, drown it in one of their many sauces, and watch them cook it up for you. Then go back and do it again as many times as your body can handle. Who wouldn't love it?",
   "Food was so delicious. The cooks were very friendly and made sure we felt welcomed. It was my niece's birthday and they made sure to tell us that the next time we went through the line, they'd do a birthday flame for her and proceeded to sing to her. Definitely recommend HuHot."

Great atmosphere with numerous TVs displaying different sporting event. Love the employees, most are super friendly and happy to be here.",
   "We are rating at 2 stars because we never received our appetizers, or food. The place has a nice atmosphere, and the menu looked wonderful. After 45 minutes of waiting for just the appetizer, we left. \nOur server was nice, but we were unable to get any information as to why we never got our order. I literally got up and stood next to the server and attempted to speak to her, but she apparently didn't notice I had been standing there. \nNormally, one would ask the customer, or say, \" let me check on your order\"",
   "Food was very good. Service was wonderful. From the time we ordered until the time we received our food was maybe 10 minutes.",
   "After just over 20 minutes of sitting without even so much as anyone asking if I wanted a drink, I left. I had no less than 4 servers look at me and never so much as acknowledge me. One was busy sitting at a table with his friends. Yes, sitting at the table with them. Menu looked awesome. Too bad I wont go back to try it. Atmosphere was cool, but loud, very loud."

   "The servers were excellent and we loved the atmosphere! Our only complaint was how spicy some of the food was. Our favorite shoestring fries were so spicy I couldn't eat very many, and they took over the flavor of the fish in my fish & chips...  my husband's salmon was also overpowered by the spice.  My son had the sweet potato fries and had the same complaint.  Next time we'll ask for plain salt!",
   "I went to this restaurant and they treated me like a king. I walked in there and the hostess said, \"Look, there's Luke Skywalker, the savior of the galaxy.\" I said, \"Yes, it is I.\" I didn't need any food, I just needed a place for Han to land the Millennium Falcon.\" They said, \"Sure, but we are going to have to charge you an overnight parking fee.\" I asked them if republic credits would work and they refused them. So I left and went back home to Tatooine.",
   "What a good selection!!!  The waitress was outstanding, she took the time to explain everything and was very accommodating.  She even gave me a pitcher of water instead of letting my glass get low.  The pizza was good, the caprese salad was really good too.  Atmosphere was as expected."

I had the seared kangaroo tenderloins and they were fabulous! I highly recommend them. My sister had the lobster bisque and said it was very good.

Beautiful and tranquil atmosphere with an extraordinarily friendly and attentive staff.  Pricing is also phenomenal for the high quality exotic foods!  First time here and it will certainly not be our last!",
   "This is my edited review\nI have been here quite a lot \ud83d\ude02\u270c\ufe0f\nSushi taste really good!!!!\nDrunken Noodle and Pad See u also really good!!\nThey have an award winning bartender there (Tony)!\nThe price is considered cheap, especially when it is a happy hour time. They have 2 cycle of happy hour. I forget about the first cycle, but the second cycle starts from 8:30 p.m till close, and It's a all day happy hour on monday!!",
   "Fantastic tasting food and customer service. The lunch deals are definitely really good but the evening food prices are significantly higher. The BBQ chicken I ordered was $14 because it was 3:30, if I had shown up roughly 30 minutes earlier, I could have ordered it for $8. This is just a small issue, the rest of the experience was awesome. I would recommend giving this place a try but make sure to bring $16-17 per person."

Eggs came out just the way I wanted them. Warm biscuits with jelly were delicious. Hashbrown casserole was yummy. Fried apples are usually good too. Lines to pay can be a bit long.",
   "Service: always amazing. Food: always amazing. Value: terrific. \nThe only reason they did not get 5 stars today: the men's restroom was disgusting. Urine on the floor that was beginning to dry, feces on the toilet seat, and paper towels everywhere. I informed the hostess of the issue as I was being seated. I never went back to check; I used the gas station restroom after lunch.",

Portions are smaller than others. Taste is superb and I will definitely be coming back to try other menu items. 1 appetizer and a entree with a drink was around $50 for 2 ppl. Staff was very friendly and service was great. Only reason its 4 stars instead of 5 is the price and space. I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family.",
   "Good local restaurant. Food comes very fast. Almost felt like fast-food kind a fast. Seafood curry is unique, but high price. Maybe seafood are expensive here. Taste is okay if you want something new, I think it's good choose. Beef pho is good. Very tender. Spare rip is also good as well, Sauce is sweet  not juicy kind a rip. Korean BBQ sauce rip.",

No one service or food is THAT good where I am going to tolerate being treated that way as a customer.  From my previous review: Horrible food and service. Small portions on the catfish fingers.",

One of my coworkers got normal wings instead of boneless wings, the manager came by and started working on getting boneless wings done for him. They eventually came to the table with the platter of wings but they were the completely different flavor/sauce. My other coworker ran into another issue. The entire table had already finished eating except one person who had ordered at the same time and ordered the same food as someone who was done eating. This was brought up to the manager and the food was later made but the person had to scarf it down at the speed of light to eat it before the lunch ended. I used to love this place but it appears to be going down in quality. I would recommend other options if you're expecting a quick lunch without issue."

   "Recently I went through the drive thru. Ordered a Wood House wonder meal with no onions and a Coke. There was only one car ahead of me and I had to wait for a long time. When I was paying for the order the employee was wearing gloves, with which he took my money and preceded to cook the food while wearing the same gloves. Wow. Very sanitary. It took awhile for my meal and while leaving the drive thru I hit a big pothole and my Coke spilled onto the floor of my car. After this I tried to avoid the other potholes in the parking lot but couldn't avoid them all. On my way home the low tire light in my dash came on so I must have some kind of tire or rim damage from hitting all the big potholes. After heading home and having to clean the sticky mess up in my car I finally was going to eat my meal. But I had to pick my burger apart first as it had onions on it even though I specifically told them no onions. There were hardly any fries either.\n\nPortions are small and the prices keep getting higher. Will NEVER come back again. Fix the parking lot, its pothole city. Not the same since the new owners took over.",
   "This is the first time I've visited since the change of ownership. I was not disappointed.\nI had the buffalo burger that was obviously hand-made from scratch, (not  a frozen machine made patty)....Delicious! Fries were also very good. This is the place to go if you just want great local home-style food where the service was fast and friendly.",
   "This is the worst place I\u2019ve eaten at so far. I ordered fried fish but was told they were out. So they gave me a fish sandwich that was bland and greasy.  We also ordered double cheese burgers. The meat was awful. And the bread was tough. You had to rip it apart to eat it. Don\u2019t go here. I\u2019d rather eat moldy fruit than eat here again.",

Our order was perfect and came out right away, in all everything was perfect.  The prices are reasonable considering that you are getting the real deal.  I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy real mexican food.  I'll be back again soon.  Thank you.",
   "Great everything.  Say yes to the groc!!!!  Yesterday, onions were overpowering so you may want to leave out onions, just in case.  Didn't keep us from finishing bowl... One serving enough for at least four.  Good-Very Good Salsa.  Chips excellent.  Service perfect.  Entrees Very Good.  Tacos most delicious.  Enchiladas two thumbs up.  On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being Authentic Mexican this is a solid 8.5, just missing a 9.",

   "You can judge a Mexican restaurant by their home-made salsa. They have a very tasty salsa. So I had no doubt that the rest of the meal was going to be great. Guacamole made right at the table. Mexican food with great flavor and taste. Great house Margherita too!  Go, right away!",
   "Excellent food, excellent margarita, freshly made guacamole at your table. Chips a little too salty. Very friendly and fast service. Great atmosphere."

Visit once and try a Curry - you'll be hooked on this restaurant.\nOrdering online is a breeze and gives you an expected order will be ready wait time. (Usually around 30-45 minutes at dinner time). Add those Spring rolls to your dinner \ud83d\udc4c",

   "This place is awesome. Super good customer service, always friendly, and the food is bitchin. My wife loves the pad Thai, and if you h want tried their wings yet, so yourself a favor, get on that website, order up some spicy Thai wings, and watch out for that level 4 spice, \u2018cause it\u2019ll get you. Excellent restaurant. We have been 3 times, and have been incredibly satisfied. During the COVID19 pandemic, they\u2019ve been super accommodating and flexible, making curbside super duper easy. 6/5, would recommend.",
   "This was our first time dining at Eat Thai. The service was phenomenal. The Thai teas had an amazing flavor. We ordered the Pad Thai with homemade peanut sauce, the Thai Pork and the spring rolls. Portion size was giant enough to bring home lunch for the next day. Delicious !",
   "I usually eat authentic thai food in my home town Jakarta Indonesia, and several asia country including Bangkok Thailand. The food here amazingly taste pretty close to the authentic one. I try the Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle. I will come back again to taste the other menu, and give u guys better review."

Waitress was very courteous though and discounted the steak from the bill and packaged my 2nd side item up to go!!  I'll return again and give Jack's another shot!!",

   "I had a great experience at Jacks a couple weeks ago on a business trip. First I was late getting in and they were wrapping up. I ordered a medium rare prime rib and it was pretty over cooked. When the manager stopped by to ask how I was I asked what she thought and she completely agreed and was quite gracious but of course that late in the day didn\u2019t have any more MR prime rib. She offered me a medium rare ribeye to replace it, was super apologetic and very gracious as was my server. Bottom line, you don\u2019t have to be perfect if you make it right. I was exhausted and getting my first really good meal in a while. They made it good when it could\u2019ve been bad. Five stars for making it right! Good food and excellent service!",

   "This is my first time traveling to Bismarck for business and someone at my hotel mentioned the Space Aliens Grill. I figured I would give it a try and I'm glad I did! This was a fun experience that I wish I could have shared with my family. The menu alone was entertaining to read through. The decor was great. One of the best themed restaurants I've ever been to!",
   "Molly, our server was outstanding. The Outerspace blooming onion was delicious, crispy and not greasy. The wings had a good tangy sauce, made your nose tingle even. Had the Taco burger, wasn't too bad I suppose. Both side salad options were very good. The atmosphere of course was what always sells the place. The music this time was pretty good too, a nice mix, some prog rock classics like Rush and Yes and more modern.",
   "The BBQ can be quite good here. That said the quality can be very hit or miss.Sometimes the ribs are right on; sometimes dry and clearly sitting around too long. They have good pizza and offer good Gluten free pizza. The staff usually have noticably good attitudes. The game room for kids is just way too overpriced its gotten kind of bonkers over the years. Being a BBQ place you'd think they would have paper towels in the bathroom but they don't -- it's hand dryers only. Always made me feel like they're cutting corners.",
   "I loved this place!  This is something I would expect to find in New Mexico or Nevada; but Bismarck, North Dakota?  Nevertheless, I was so glad to have stumbled across it during our one night stay in Bismarck.  Apparently, there are currently 3 locations across North Dakota and Minnesota.  The entire atmosphere inside is very unique with really cool decor and memorabilia.  The food was fantastic with many dishes having alien themed names.  There is also an arcade in back with a pretty nice selection of games.  Overall, this place is awesome for kids and fun-loving adults alike!",
   "I was very disappointed. I went in and was seated, the only one there. The server came over and got my drink order, it was delivered, then got my meal order, she brought the salad and almost immediately  brought my meal. I hadn't even gotten a chance to start eating my salad. Of course then my meal was cold. I felt very rushed. The food was fairly good. I also noticed the server never did smile. Things like that are important to me."

My waitress suggested the bruschetta burger lunch special - 10oz of beef smothered in aioli with thick-cut bacon on a toasted bun (I forget what kind). Most burger patties taste similar, but this one was flavorful and smooth as BUTTER - not grainy like some. Awesome service and a great atmosphere.",

Their menu is somewhat pricey of you're going for a meal, but is perfect if you're wanting to sample a wide array of meats or cheeses. They do also offer a selection of vegan meats and cheeses, which was appreciated by one of the people in our group.",

I've enjoyed almost every food item I've ever ordered here including Boneless Wings, Sandwiches, Shepherd's Pie, sweet potato fries, etc. Their Blarney dip is out of this world. Atmosphere is overall wonderful, although sometimes feels a little too dark. Love coming here to watch sports. Service is very attentive, sometimes almost too attentive. Great team of employees there - they do a great job making you feel welcome. Surprised that more people don't go here.",

   "I rarely ever leave written reviews, but if I can prevent some poor soul from wasting their money on this over-priced place, I will.  The only reason I give this place one star is because the people were nice.  But that is the only positive thought I can give.  The food was horrible.  The sushi tasted like it had been made the day before and was left out until I put it on my plate.  Dry rice, warm fish sashimi isn't supposed to be warm).  I thought I would fare better with the standard Chinese food they have on offer. But even that was subpar, and greasy even by Chinese food standards.  The staff, while nice people, we're not very good at their jobs. The couple in front of me came to their table and saw that I had not been wiped down and when they requested to have it cleaned, the lady leading them to their table pulled a few napkins out of the napkin box and wiped it off. At the end of the day, they double charged me.  They corrected it, The refund will take three to five business days to take effect. It's not going to break my bank, but it is irritating that I'd have to do that for a simple Chinese meal. For $16.50 for a drink and meal, I feel like I was cheated just a little bit. I don't mind paying that much for a Chinese buffet, but it has to be better than what I encountered last night at this restaurant. hopefully the owners of this restaurant will read this, and make the corrections necessary to make this place better..",

   "Great food with a good atmosphere. The turkey melt and burgers are very tasty. Our service was great and staff were helpful. They have a separate room to book for special events as well. Tuesday night they had bingo at 7 pm.",
   "Great spot, the bar tender bought me a drink when I was down and out... And the rest of the team took great care of me. Drinks may be a little more, but the service goes above and beyond. Location is fantastic by the mall, and right accros from the hotel I was staying at for a few weeks. Maybe not the place to have 5 drinks, but 1 or 2 seems to be the ticket. The food is great, and that atmosphere is fantastic. Old world look with flame lighting, and cans powered by belts... See photos. Banquet capability, the first night I stopped in, the manager let me have a few left over burgers from an event as well... Abasalutly worth the extra few bucks, as you get what you pay for with almost anything.",
   "The place looks neat on inside, although the A/C is a little too high. The TV placement is a bit odd and makes it difficult to get a great view no matter where you sit. Some of the food there is delicious. The boneless wings here taste awesome and so does the pulled pork flatbread. The nachos come in good portions - I got the quarter size and you can see the size in the picture. Service to take our food order once we were ready seemed slow. The food came out quite fast.",
   "Very cool Irish pub atmosphere and the food is great, plus free popcorn. Only hitch is the price, which may make it an unattractive lunch option as an entree + beer can easily get to $25-30. If you're going with a group for dinner or looking for atmosphere then look no further.",
   "Excellent! Had the Stacked Club, fresh fruit and a side salad for myself. Needless to say I only ate half of my club it was so huge! Gluten free menu is awesome, best menu I have seen in a restaurant lately. Boyfriend felt like he had a real meal for once. He had the Brie & Bacon burger with fries. Burger bun is gluten free and pretty tasty, fries are cooked in exclusive fry only fryer so he was able to have them. Definitely one of our go to places for gluten free options in Bismarck!"

   "Used to be great. But theve cut costs without cutting prices and I can tell. And honestly the food is miserable I got a Delux meatball calzone (spegetti and meatballs with cheese  in a calzone)  \nThe  spegetti has practically no sause,  the cheese was all in one spot, the crust is burnt and the meatballs were still frozen in the middle."

   "The food is good and the in-house beers are excellent! The service was a bit lacking, but not terrible. I had their bacon cheese burger on my most recent visit, and it was very good. I highly recommend it. For a side dish I ordered the horseradish coleslaw. I liked the flavor, but it was a bit dry for me. I like my slaw a bit creamier, but it was still good.",
   "Very very good. We came here for Sunday brunch (our second time). First time was excellent, and the second time didn\u2019t fail to impress for the most part.\n\nI had chicken (which was home battered and fried, not frozen) and bacon waffles with a brunch syrup. The waffle was dry towards the end due to its density.\n\nMy picky eater devoured her pecan waffles and said, \u201cI want more.\u201d\n\nMy wife and other daughter each had an egg tart (think scramble in a puff pastry shell).  The highlight was the house-made sausage featured in the dish.\nThree of the meals came with a side of \u201cfresh fruit\u201d.  contrary to common thought, frozen or canned fruit with a sour, spicy taste is not fresh.  They would have preferred an orange wedge or 1/2 a banana.\n\nOrange juice was fresh and little pulp. \n\nThe service was slow and spotty. We often waited long periods before our waiter Tyson to check on us, see if we needed anything, or even to take care of our bill. The place was not even close to being packed so I don\u2019t know what the hold ups were.\n\nOverall a nice Sunday brunch place for Bismarck, just disappointed in the wait service.",
   "Excellent food and drink selection. The poutine is delicious! Love the atmosphere and decor. Be prepared to pay for the quality as it isn't an inexpensive meal. 2 entrees, an appetizer, and 2 non alcoholic drinks will cost about $50",
   "Excellent vibe and awesome place for drinks. Above average place for food. Great variety and quality of drinks at reasonable prices. The food is a little pricey. The jaeger schnitzel is highly recommended and delicious. Some of the other food options didn't look or sound as good. The chicken pot pie has a great presentation. Not a fan of pretzels coming as a side on one of the dishes someone got. Wish they had larger water glasses instead of the shot-sized ones.",
   "Clam chowder was delicious! Tried the poutine but prefer a brown gravy instead of their twist on the gravy. But all in all the poutine was good. Ordered the club sandwich and was very tasty! I had ordered the Browned Butter Old Fashioned which was also quite tasty. We went there around 1pm and it was kind of busy and our service was good. Waitress checked in multiple times and even boxed our food up for us. Overall a good experience."

   "Never order before closing. Looked at the reviews and took the plunge. Beige was the color of all. Literally same sauce for garlic beef, Mongolian beef and orange chicken. Upcharge fried rice was bland and lacked any vegetables at all. I understand catering to the American palate, and I understand this is North Dakota.... But this is insulting... Also, battered dipped eggrolls ... My heart cries (as an aside, the staff was polite upon pickup... Offering plates and napkins.",

   "I placed order on line and during check out, my order date got changed. I called Bismarck store, a very pleasant voice answered. Long story short. The food was some of the best we have had. A great appreciation for you and your staff. Nicole was the young lady who made it possible. Kudos to the chef, most excellent pasta",
   "Typical chain, and typical of this chain. It\u2019s always clean. The wait staff is ALWAYS professional. Like this place only hires and demands the best - it really is on a level with some of the finer dining I\u2019ve experienced. I\u2019d be shocked if I ever went in there and even had a waitress that was disinterested, let alone rude. Best team in town.\n\nThe food - I mean nothing bad when I say it\u2019s just average American Italian food. That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s why I\u2019m there. It\u2019s not over the top amazing like it was made by a master chef, because it\u2019s not - it\u2019s chain restaurant recipes that work, but don\u2019t wow.",
   "I have been going to olive garden for over 25 years.  The Bismarck location provides the best service of any I have ever been to.  Megan was a fantastic server and worked hard to go above and beyond throughout the meal.\n\nObviously most food is fake vs real like it was 25 years ago regardless of where you go to eat.  Fake food all tastes about the same because it is all high fructose corn syrup.  Real food would make the meals cost 2-3x more than they do.  So it kinda is what it is.  There is no way they can keep the prices the same today as they were 25 years ago and use real food.\n\nSo that aside, the service from everyone was incredible.   From the greeter to the server, manager, dish clearing staff, food delivery...all of them we extremely friendly, happy, upbeat and together provided a very pleasant dining experience.",

The food service is always open late and they offer free hot pretzel after a certain hour with drink purchase to ensure that you can sober up and get home safely. I definitely recommend the peanut butter burger it sounds odd but it is amazing.",

   "Absolutely love this place -- they have a retro 80s theme. It brings back great memories from the 80s as well as of good old Snoopers Bump and Tilt from when I was a kid. Lots of good arcades all free-to-play. Their craft beer wall is really neat where you get a card and server yourself. That said, it seems like it always has a little too many fruity drinks for my taste but I can usually find something good. The food is phenomenal I highly recommend their \"Predator\" pizza. That's the meat-lovers. On Sundays they open the place up to kids all games still free! Adults can still get beer from the gated in beer wall as long as you get a bracelet.",
   "Great entertainment, good pizza, and large beer selection. Been here twice so far and will be back. Go at off-peak hours for best experience. Tried to go once when it was packed and don't think it would be as fun. Pizzas are large and loaded with toppings, and they'll do half one way and half another which makes it easier to choose from the list of awesome pizzas. Great selection of games from 80's-90's.\n\nSome patience required. Games take a beating in this environment and both times I've been there have been some games/controllers broken or not working properly. There are plenty of options and it seems like they try to stay on top of maintenance. \n\nThe self serve beer wall is neat and convenient. Only downside is if a tap starts sending foam, which happened to us on a couple taps tonight. Not sure how they meter it but it's charged by the ounce, so disappointing to get a glass full of foam that would usually be the bartender's problem.\n\nBeer and food is maybe slightly more expensive than other places but not by much, and it is well worth any difference for the gaming options.",
   "Absolutely love this place!  Great atmosphere, great food, great music, great beer selection, and last but not least fun games!  It has everything you need for a fun night out with friends!  The takeout is great as well.  They have some of the best pizza in town!",
   "This place is a great addition to Bismarck. A place for 21+ only that has old school arcade games was much needed and this place delivers in this area. The service at the food counter was great too.\n\nNow for the negatives. The music is sometimes way too loud and makes it difficult for people to chat. Just wish it could be larger and allow for more games. Thus, this place is best attended when fewer people like on a weeknight. On a weekend night, it can be difficult to find open games to play. The place is small and thus doesn't have much seating availability for busier nights.  I tried the Chicago style dog, which had a great presentation, but the taste was just ok. Also, not a fan of the pretzel side - I wish there were other sides to choose from. Tried the Roadhouse pizza - the flavor of it tasted great but there was hardly any chicken on it - the bread ratio was too high compared to everything else.",
   "It was a nice flash back to the 80's. I enjoy a teen wolf, a hot dog loaded with chili, Doritos and a lot of yummyness. It was radical!"

Some of the food is very delicious such as their pork belly tacos, jalapeno popper pizza, and fries. Some of the other food is just so-so and lacks flavor. The food is rather pricey. Great place to watch a game. Wait times to get seated are unusually long despite plenty of empty seats. Hopefully they can get more servers.",
   "Love Stonehome! It\u2019s nice to see friendly and consistent faces when I eat there for lunch and the nighttime atmosphere is hopping too. I don\u2019t drink beer, but they have a great selection of wines and of course mixed drinks. I think the best thing is their rotating pizzas of the week. I don\u2019t like to deviate and try things new, but this is an easy way for me to branch out. Who would have known I\u2019d like artichokes on pizza?!",
   "Great spot.  Looks really fancy has a good tap list.  Right next to a bank for some reason.  Like you gotta enter though the bank.",
   "Amazing atmosphere,  wait staff on point and food is phenomenal, beer is just an extra. Found a new Bismark must!  Thank you for an awesome family dinner",
   "Good food. Loved the pretzel and candied bacon (delicious)! The Rusty Tractor pizza had tasty toppings and an even better crust. Fish and chips were near perfect! The fish was light and flakey with flavorful batter and was not overly greasy. Loved the house made tartar sauce! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars- service was a little slow but not terrible. Overall, worth the time and money."

It took forever to get order only to have  food ice cold. There was 2 of us, both ordered the all you can eat special.  Both reordered more shrimp,wings and same old story, cold food. How can you make customers wait that long only to serve cold food?  I cannot rate this visit very high and it will take a while before I return to Applebee's North Bismarck ND",

After 2 hours we went to find out what was taking so long. 30 minutes later the manager told us that our food had been given to someone else. We were offered a refund or to wait for our food to be made. We chose the refund as we didn't want to spend more time waiting.",

   "Service was fast. Food was hot when we got it.",
   "Just a brief and sincere thanks to the staff at Carino's in Bismarck. Stopped in for a glass of wine and pasta meal. Ordered fettuccine with marinara and shrimp. Absolutely fantastic! Only to be surpassed by their service. Thanks Autumn along with all the service and management staff for paying attention to me during a \"very trying day.\" I shall return!! Thanks again.",
   "Just saw a post on social media on how your restaurant will be open while adhering to 'guidelines' during this pandemic. How absolutely unprofessional and profit driven. I feel so terrible for your employees, which I assume you won't be supporting.",
   "Stopped in for dinner 01/18/20. Ordered the seafood fettuccine. Half the mussels were served unopened, and the calamari was overcooked. Flavors were good though and service was fine.",
   "This is the place to dine on Monday night.  Exceptional value, family platters half price, a family can dine for less than $20!!! We had the spicy chicken romano,  it is tantalizing! Artichokes, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, chicken with bow tie pasta.  Autumn was a fantastic server, very attentive she even had a table of ten, very impressive! Great food, great service at a unheard of price!  The patio is awesome. Jennee T has added some water fountains which is so serene.  The Italian nachos are a favorite of ours. Yummy!"

   "We ordered the meatloaf. It was horrible. Tasted like it was mostly filler with a funny texture. It was also cold. The mashed potatoes were cold. I had to pick through the salad. Our server was nice, but the food quality is very poor. Both of our meals were not good.",
   "Knoephla soup was very good and fleischkuechle was pretty good too, but not five star.  I would repeat and try some of the other German specialty options.  Coffee was solid.  Waitress was nice.  Love the old time atmosphere also.  Wish I could give 4.5.",
   "Not from around here so stopped in when staying and was very impressed!! Their menu selection is great. Their food is amazing. And had good service too!! If you\u2019re looking for a quick, efficient, delicious, and comfortable feeling place to eat, go here!!!",
   "Food 5/5 stars\nService 5/5 stars\n5.99 daily special breakdown\nI order 2 of the 5.99 daily specials with 2 ice waters, and the host explains to me that, the only way to get the \"advertised 5.99 daily special, is that they need to add a $2.39 drink (ordered ice water) to each special. I feel like maybe they should add that info to the front sign. 2  of the 5.99 daily lunch specials and we will only add $4.78 plus tax to your meal. Should be advertised as the $8.38 + tax lunch deal.",
   "I just stopped in for dessert but the service was great. Nice and  clean and fast. The banana split was good and even though I know its work to make it, the server was very nice."

   "Staff was great! I was THAT customer that came in like 10 minutes before closing and the food was still out ready to go and hot.\nPortion sizes were on the small side compared to Chipotle though.",
   "It's nice to order food just the way you like it.",
   "Their system went offline today for about 20 min at the beginning of the lunch rush. The staff handled the situation very well and kept their good attitudes. \nOh and my Chicken Naked Nachos were awesome!! I wish we'd have gotten a free drink or a small discount for the inconvenience. But, I do realize that decision wasn't theirs to make.",
   "Great food and they offer a college student discount. A couple employees aren't very good to work with. But otherwise a good place to eat."

   "Excellent bagels! You can by them to take home (4 in a batch) or get them toasted with cream cheese to eat right there! Very pleasant ladies running this place. Scones were tender and moist, but I cannot rave enough about the bagels! I will be back for more!",
   "One of those places you can drive by a hundred times and never know it's there!\n\nOnce you're in the White Drug Pharmacy, 117 N 5th, east side of the road just north of Main, head way to the back. Yeah, there's really a place to eat in here! Go on, past the counters, look for the big sign on the back wall- The White House- yeah right there, no really! Go back there, door on your right.\n\nTake a peek at the Specials Board. Today, Wednesday, Sloppy Joe's was on the menu. So I had to order it, since I am really fond of, and I mean not in a brotherly way, FOND of Joe's. I was leaning towards the burger, which was a buck off today, but I'm really fond of Sloppy Joe's!\n\nGot two on my plate, with some chips and pickle. The sauce was not tomato-y, but light, slightly sweet, and tangy. That's some good sauce, oh yeah. Served in a fluffy, soft, yeasty, home made bun. I didn't add anything to it, and it didn't need anything. Just naked and unafraid.\n\nI was thinking of ordering two more, but I'll just back a few more times, now that I know there's really a cafeteria in that pharmacy!\n\nReasonably priced, daily specials, hot, fresh, and tasty! Go there, Missy will take care of you!",
   "Tastes like home cooking. Wonderful service!",
   "Homemade food the tater tot hot dish was good I was hungry and could of used a bigger portion but I eat alot. There is also baked goods made by Mark. Homemade goods there great also. I have no complaints about this place. One more thing you can sign up for texts and when you do sign up u get a free meal just for signing up. Now you can't beat that!!! So get on over to White house Cafeteria u can't go wrong.",
   "Reminds me of the old KB's that was in Kirkwood mall years ago.\nTHEY USE REAL Potatoes, CHEESE BUTTONS ON FRIDAYS. Very Good. Clean Kitchen compared to many others in Bis-Man"

The coke was out so we thought we would let them know and the lady said it'll take about 20 minutes.... We went to go sit down to eat but couldn't find a clean table so we sat at a dirty one while I watched my husband eat his lunch,, it was cold again so again I didn't eat it. I do not recommend this place and customer service is terrible.",
   "I was just passing thru town and stopped here, the guys working behind  the counter were super friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and flavorful and would eat here again.",
   "food was good. service was kinda pushy tables were all dirty. and they had some of the warmers open when I was in line. absolutely disgusting. Does anyone in that place clean? only gave it a 2 star because the food was good.  \nI wont be going back if that's the way the front is cleaned how bad is it in the back?\n\nJust wanted to add that Pancheros Reached out to me and I am very happy about how they handled themselves. I will go there again. Knowing they took care of the issue.",
   "Best burritos in town. Absolutely delicioso.",
   "Just not as good as I remember. This used to be my favorite place!\nIt truely is lacking flavor. Everything was very blahh..NO bite striked me as \"Mhmm this is good\".\nGuac is mushy because it has far too many tomatoes in it and completely ruins the consistency and taste.\nThe vegetables are over cooked and not seasoned/marinated like advertised.\nI had to look into this but there is $1.10 difference in the meal I ordered vs. Qdoba and the difference is so worth it for so many reasons."

When you want to do pick up orders or to go orders it seems there is no appreciation for the customer. I have sent my Sons down to get me a simple order to enjoy in the convenience of my own home and fine dining and nothing was right or it seemed like the server putting it together didn\u2019t care. I am very disappointed, the take out especially if the customer is picking up it should be just as good as the dine in experience as well as enjoying it else where. Get it together Denny\u2019s!",

I may give this place one more chance but not likely. I think I can get a better burger elsewhere.",

The drive thru and window are the same issue when it comes to ordering, handing money and getting food from the employees.  I brought my attention to other business who have let me use the drive thru in town to order food, and they even said Burger Time is being hypocritical on the issue.
