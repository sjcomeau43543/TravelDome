   "Very informative visitors center with excellent views of the glacier.  Videos showing melting of the glacier over the years and other glacier info.  Specimens of local wildlife on display.  Nice little gift shop.  Clean restrooms.  Well-informed rangers give short presentations and answer questions. Completely disabled accessible,  with captioned videos,  and an elevator from the lower level.  Highly recommended!",
   "Go see it while it's still there! Climate change is destroying this glacier. The staff and viewing areas are really amazing. They provide telescopes and knowledge about the area. They also have videos and interactive displays. If you hike the area you'll be able to see all the places the glacier used to be, and you can take really nice shots all around the area. They have live salmon spawning in the area, and other wildlife. It's very untouched by man. Very wonderful experience.",
   "Get ready for crowds! It\u2019s a great starting point to find out more about the park and local trails.  The rangers were helpful. The gift shop was small, but adequate. \n\nIf you are trying to get your Junior Ranger badge make sure you download the Agents of Discovery Badge app first.",
   "Beautiful site, informative ranger, and well maintained.  I enjoyed our brief stop here at the visitors center after walking out to Nugget Falls and getting a closer view of the glacier. I recommend stopping at the visitors center before the hike, however it was nice to stop in and warm up afterward.",
   "Very nice trails and guest center. I found the map of how the glacier has receded and formed new bodies of water and the salmon birth/death route exhibit the most fascinating. Highly recommend going there if you're in the area. Lots of small plane flights to see from the sky too closer in town, but we didn't do that."

   "It's a fun experience. The guides were wonderful.\nI just imagined it will be more time zipping....\nIt was 4 ziplines and one bridge to walk.\nThe thing was that each zipline lasted about 10 seconds.... and waiting was very long time.\nI expected to be more time in the air...\nI guess that for people that it is their first time it will not be dissapointing as for me.",
   "I loved every minute. Guides were fantastic. Andrew was phenomenal. I want you to know I accidentally dropped my phone in the van on way back to ship and as I was frantically looking for it in my backpack at the drop off here he comes in the van. He came back to bring me my phone. Thank you Andrew. I will never forget you.",

They take you through the park in a covered, open on the sides \"stretch golf cart\" type of vehicle, but they don't tell you that it's just to give you an initial overview of the property, and not meant to be a photo opp tour. At the end of the tour, we were told we had all day to take photos and walk the grounds but it's a long way and very steep. I guess it would have been fine if we would have planned our time accordingly and knew to make a day trip of hiking out of it, but we didn't know this ahead of time. Otherwise, great tour and gardens.",
   "Simply beautiful with stunning views of the harbor. \n\nUpside down trees with planted flowers are unique and you can tell that the owner, Steve, puts his heart and soul into the property. It must be contagious because all of the staff seem excited to be there, it truly shoes.",
   "Fabulous place to visit. Rainforest, botanical gardens and views. Excellent guides with knowledgeable and passionate narration. And to top it all - an eagle's nest with two nearly mature young. Like I said - fabulous!!",
   "Nice facility. Had a tram ride through the rainforest. Stopped at an observation platform 500+ feet above sea level. Saw several eagles. The \"upside down\" trees were very interesting. Beautiful showcase of the forest. Visitor center has a small gift shop and offers drinks and snacks for sale. There are tables and chairs available in a covered area.",
   "The story behind this garden is what makes it amazing.  The owner is also the gardener and creator of everything you see. His heart is everywhere you look as you tour this beautiful garden.  There were also Eagle chicks just born in a nest on his site. He has developed a true haven and natural habitat for the plants and animals."

Thanks to Bruce our skillful and friendly pilot and the staff at Taku Lodge. The scenery of the flight is a must of any Alaska trip. The remoteness, scenery and food at the lodge were amazing. The lodge staff prepared salmon on an open grill (afterwards a juvenile bear climbed in the fire pit to eat salmon flavored sand) which was delicious along with rice, beans, slaw and amazing bread and the best ginger cookies I\u2019ve ever had. They offer a full but limited bar as well, a fun gift shop and a short guided hike to a water fall. The staff at the lodge were so friendly, thank you for a great experience and kudos to the chef! Sit down in a chair there and enjoy the view and fresh air:)",

   "Best excursion of the trip! Starting out with the sea plane over and the tour of the glaciers to the incredible food and having it cooked fresh on an open fire to the nature walk around the property; worth every penny and then some!",
   "This was by far the best excursion I took! The flight over the glaciers was awesome, they are incredibly beautiful, and their expanse has to be seen to be fully appreciated. Taku Lodge is lovely, and the meal was fabulous. The bear, Lois, who came to clean up the grill, was one of the high points. The walk afterwards is recommended but bug spray is a must!! The mosquitos are HUGE and swarm in numbers beyond belief. The grounds are very scenic, and the staff both at the lodge, and at Wings, is terrific. I HIGHLY recommend!",
   "Our pilot's name was Bruce. He made us feel safe and showed us so many beautiful sites. He was the nicest man, and if we ever get the chance to fly with Wings Airways again, we would request Bruce as our pilot. He pointed out many different points of interest to make sure we would see them and get pictures of them. We are so grateful for the opportunity we had and that Bruce was our pilot."

This could be a quick stop or a long tour after 2 floors things start to look similar. You can look online to see if the are in session during your visit. Definitely worth a quick visit though!",

   "Easy trail with access to Sandy Beach.  Live the historic plaques, wish there were more!  Many good spots to read - bring a book!",
   "Located just over the bridge from Juneau on Douglas Island, the trail follows the shore just inside the tree line. Wide mostly gentle walk path commemorates the once large gold mining industry. There are points of interest along the way where the miners onced worked and played. There is also a beach area where you can watch various ships, including cruise liners coming and going from Juneau.",
   "While we did not actually do the trail, we did walk up to the entrance of one of the abandoned none shaft entrances. As you walk towards it the temperature drops and you can feel the rush of cold mountain air got you as you advance. Hopefully I'll be able to go back and hike the trail, but there were many locals there saying it's a very nice trail walk.",
   "Very Interesting History and a peaceful walk. Highly recommend to anyone. Easy trail for young and old alike.",
   "It's very well done, making a maintained feature out of a bunch of ruins that could have been otherwise forgotten."

   "A must stop in Juneau for any dog lover is to pay homage to Patsy Ann, she was and continues to be the \"Official Greeter of Juneau\". While deaf from birth, Patsy Ann had the ability to 'hear' steamship whistles and never failed to greet a ship. Patsy Ann died in 1942 but her presence is still here in this statue. Visitors are encouraged to \"greet her and touch her and in leaving, carry with you the blessings of friendship through your life's journey.\" Thanks Patsy Ann!",
   "The statue commemorates the local dog, Patsy Ann. The story goes that she was a local dog that preferred to roam around the town, than be at home with her owner. She became a welcome and popular fixture around the city. \n\nPatsy Ann had the ability to know when the steamship was about to arrive, running down to the dock to wait long before anyone else knew a ship was coming. \n\nThis statue sits next to the cruise ships, so  you should pass it to or from the ship. Her nose shows signs of rubbing, so giver her a pat when you go past.",

   "Ryan and Spencer were very knowledgeable, professional and really fun tour guides. They were full of facts about the lake and glacier and also shared many funny jokes on the canoe to and from the glacier. This really helped us forget we were paddling 2.5 miles one way. Being able to hike on the glacier is a once in a lifetime experience, well worth every penny. Will recommend this to everyone I know travelling to Juneau.",
   "Absolutely terrific experience, on a group canoe adventure on Mendenhall Lake.  I don\u2019t usually warm up to guided excursions but these guys did everything right.  Quality gear, awesome included snacks, great equipment and very personable, prompt and trustworthy staff!",
   "The excursion I went on was canoeing to and then walking on the Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska. Our tour was led by Ryan and Grant in the first week of June, who were both very knowledgeable and funny. Ryan, in particular, has a fun-loving spirit that was infectious. They kept saying how perfect a day we were having in terms of temperature, weather, and wind. And it was certainly great. On the hour-long, single large canoe ride over there were great views of Nugget Falls and Thunder Mountain. The guides had lots of information about the local wildlife, other trips/hikes, the timeline of the retreat of the glacier, and other notable tidbits.\n\nGetting in and out of the canoe was easy and the tour provided absolutely everything you'd need or want. Anyone who is not in bad shape would be able to do this tour fairly easily. There is walking with some elevation involved.\n\nWe walked up to the glacier over a rocky moraine and put the crampons on. I had no issues whatsoever with slipping with these on. Saw all the notable features that were accessible that day, the glacier changes constantly. But just being up there and on it, seeing the vastness out before you was worth it on its own.\n\nGrant was nice enough to get me a bottle full of glacier run-off water which I still have (thanks to checked luggage). I hope Ryan has upgraded his own glacier water's container by now. To cap things off, on the boat ride back, we got an extended close-up view of the porcupine that lives on an outcropping of land. My first one I've seen in the wild. Finished up with some hot cocoa back at the van. Great day.",
   "Excellent experience! Our guides Casey and Joey were friendly and knowledgable. The canoe trips out and back went quickly, and our guides did a nice job pointing out noteworthy wildlife and geographic features. \n\nOnce we reached Mendenhall Glacier, they gave us a super-helpful safety briefing showing us how to properly walk on the ice. \n\nOur guides gave us plenty of time to savor walking onto the glacier as well as exploring an ice cave. We had much more time on the ice than on a helicopter tour.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see a glacier up close.",
   "The tour was incredible. Ben and Grant were wonderful guides, very well informed, pleasant and patient. We canoed to the glacier and walked out on it. The views were spectacular and one of a kind and we had hot drinks waiting for us after. I would definitely recommend this tour company, great value for the price."

   "Really fun hike. Be careful going off trail. Avoid scrambling up the side of the glacier when you get close. It gets pretty dangerous. As well as walking on melting ice. Amazing views and decent caves",
   "Sign says it's maintained. Well it is up to a certain point then it becomes a 5.10 wall climb . Just kidding but It's not an easy hike if you want to make it all the way to the end of it.  About 40 minutes from the trail head you will have fantastic view of the glacier the mountains Mendenhall Lake and the valley . You might also see some beautiful vibrant colored blue birds. Just do it",
   "AMAZING TRAIL. Take the outlook trail when the trail splits. Make sure you snap a picture of the map! It is a somewhat difficult hike. I would say not the best hike to do in the rain.",
   "Great views! Great place! Must go here, total bucket list item. Walking on a glacier is surreal!!",
   "A great moderate to strenuous hike especiallyduringthe winter months...lots of climbing walking, glasading on ice. There are 3 places that have a rope attached to a tree to assist with the hike.  Trails are maintained for about 3 miles...after that highly suggest downloading the url that is provided at one of the stops along the trail.  Remember to bring your ice tracks, gaiters and hiking poles...will make the hike easier."

Walk very quietly to not startle them away.",

Loved hearing all the historical & educational tidbits of the area, learning about the different types of rocks & stones in the area... it was an all over a great time!! Thank-you!! WE HIGHLY Recommend this Excursion!! ",

We were met at the port, took an easy drive over, got suited up and instructions, flew to the glacier and had the most amazing experience with the dogs and the people at the camp.  The staff is amazing, friendly, and professional.  It was brilliant!",

Within 15 minutes, we saw a humpback breach. That was followed up by a simultaneous breach by a mother humpback and her calf...then about six more breaches. By far, this has become my favorite vacation experience of all time. \n\nThe Skagway mushing camp was also incredible. That staff was friendly and we got the most out of our day. I loved this excursion more than I expected.\n\nAlaska Shore Excursions is reasonably priced and delivers on a first rate experience. I recommend this company to anyone visiting the ports they operate in.",

The lady musher was good but  we would\u2019ve loved to ride  much longer. Had fun  going over the bridge and listening to the History of the race.

The guides are great.  I have uploaded some of our pics from the day.\n\nAnd if you are anything like me, you know there is nothing as awesome as a train.",
   "We came on a beautiful day and really enjoyed the ride up and back. \n\nPick the left side to get the best valley view on the way up (I think that it is a little longer time-wise since the train is slower going uphill) and side-of-the-mountain going down. You are not allowed to exit the train (there are no stops) or move from car-to-car once it starts moving. Our car was full, so no moving to other seats for us.\n\nIt is worth making it out to the outside platforms at least once. Our car had a platform hog who just stood there the entire trip and wouldn't share, but there is a platform on each end of the car. \n\nThere are no food options, but bottled water is provided. Each car has one restroom, which nobody seems to know how to use--it takes 3 pumps to purge your poo, please. \n\nInformative guides makes announcements throughout the trip to point out sites of special interest. Recommended."

   "We visited Icy Straight while on an Alaskan cruise. We had so much fun riding the zip line. On the bus ride up the mountain we saw a few bears. The bus driver was so nice to stop and let us take pictures. It was such a beautiful place and the views are amazing!",
   "We stopped here as part of our Alaska cruise in May 2019. Our itinerary included the Ziprider and whale watching tour. Neither disappointed us. We had a great time. It is a 45 minute bus ride to the top of the mountain.  It only takes 60 seconds or so to get to the bottom. What a blast! The whale watching tour was great as well. Stop in the lodge and get a drink. I believe the one called \"the zipper\" comes with a  shot glass. The weather was perfect for us. I hope we can return again.",
   "Tourist trap. Get to the next town over. There's some great restaurants and culture over there. And better tours. Local guides over there are rad.",
   "Beautiful location! We went on the zip line here & LOVED it! Everyone was super nice. Only issue is there isn't much to do beyond shopping & the zip line. But the surrounding area is just gorgeous to sit & take in \ud83d\ude18",

   "This tramway was an ultimate with a spectacular view of mountains and beaches. As we head up or head down in tram, we can hear audio that tells us all about the view around. Heading up and then trek towards the tip of the hill in between enjoying the snow around is fun.",
   "Short but fun tramway ride up the mountain. Price seemed a little steep, but I read reviews saying the views were incredible and absolutely worth it. Unfortunately, we rode it in the morning so the fog had not burned off yet. However, we still had an amazing few of the town up until about halfway; then, once we passed through the fog, we had an incredible view of the mountain range from above the fog-line. We still found it very worth the price; however, we wished we had known ahead of time that the ticket is good for all day. Had we known, we would have factored in more time in our afternoon to ride it again once the fog had cleared. Even so, I definitely recommend.",
   "Simple walk-up ticket purchase at the terminal. Helpful and friendly staff. Ticket is good all day for unlimited trips. Facilities up top offer panoramic views from the terminal bridge and two additional city-facing observation points that are about a 5 minute hike up a trail with moderate grade. Well worth the small investment of effort. Additional trails are available for more commited hikers.  A basic restaurant with scenic views and a modest menu offers refreshment, as well as a small walk-up coffee bar serving fresh local brew.  Completely worth the $35 fare and easily one of the best activity experiences to enjoy within the town of Juneau.",
   "This thing was cool. People complaining about $35 bucks for a once in a life time experience need to chill. Plus you get a discount for AAA. The views on top were phenomenal. I would do it again and be better prepared to hike all the way to the top!",
   "Friendly and kind staff.  LOVED the opportunity to be able to see a live bald eagle up close and take pictures.  It's nice to know she is loved and taken care of.  The views are spectacular, but the food is expensive and just modified fast food, except for the crab.  Lovely walk through the woods on a well marked trail.  Great for all ages!  So many say it is too expensive but I don't agree.  They have to keep the tram serviced all winter when not operating and summer when up and running.  It is run on electricity.  If you plan right and take plenty of time to walk the trails, see the native film (only 20 minutes long) and truly appreciate the beauty of the mountain, it is money well spent.  There are native made gifts in the shop, some which you cannot find elsewhere.  A smart shopper will ask questions and know what you're buying.  We had a great time."

   "What a cool spot in Juneau! Juneau has the pioneer charm that I would expect to find when visiting a place known as the last frontier. Visiting this saloon is the cherry on top of the whipped cream if you're looking for the pioneer nostalgia like I was. There are historical memorabilia hanging on the walls, flags on the roof rafters from visitors from all over the globe and writing on the walls from hundreds of patrons throughout the years. Bear skins, taxadermy moose heads, giant halibut and mountain goats are also decorating the walls. Oh, snap! I forgot to mention, the beer is cold and local, the food is delicious, and the service was great! Kristen was our bartender and brought a warmth that was missing from Juneau in the middle of January! Awesome job!",
   "Quite an exciting place with old world charm.  Had a great piano player,  friendly people, and of course, in scenic Alaska.  My girlfriend was really impressed by the place.  Good thing Russia sold it to the US, or us Canadians would have a common border with Russia......can you even imagine that.....??",

The views were simply incredible and the staff made it so much fun! 5 stars simply isn\u2019t enough to rate this unforgettable experience! If you\u2019re in decent enough shape to make this trek, don\u2019t pass on this opportunity! I\u2019d go back in a heartbeat!",
   "Great cruise ship excursion experience. Bo and Ben did an amazing job showing our kids and ourselves the glacier in a safe, professional and fun way. If you're physically fit enough, I highly recommend this excursion.",
   "Went canoeing and hiking up Mendenhall Glacier with two guides.  Hands down, this was the best thing I did while in Alaska.  The guides were very knowledgeable and clearly had a safety first attitude.  The paddle across the lake was easy since we had 13 people in a canoe working together to get us there.  The short hike to and trek on the glacier was amazing.  The glacier is gorgeous. We had time to get down into a small crevasse and check out the beautiful blue water at the bottom.  I hope to come back to Juneau one day and have a longer (half day) adventure on the glacier with the guides!",
   "We did a private guided hike to the Mendenhall Glacier and it was the highlight of our trip. It\u2019s the excursion we were most looking forward to and it by far exceeded our expectations. Our guide Daniel was amazing. The whole process what amazing. They were attentive to questions from the booking process to the actual event itself. The views are breathtaking and worth the challenging hike.  We enjoyed the challenge of the hike and along with the best workout, we got to see and walk on the beautiful glacier. The pictures don\u2019t do it justice. Thanks Daniel for the highlight of our trip."

   "First of all, Juneau Tours went above & beyond in accommodating us on this tour! Our ship excursion was cancelled that morning & Juneau Tours managed to work us in very last minute. The office faculty so so very friendly & nice. Then we boarded the boat...! Boat was very clean & comfortable. Captain Kara, Danielle & Dave also so very friendly & fun! You could tell they had respect & passion for the whales. We felt as if we knew & understood the whales personally as Danielle shared her whale facts with us. Then of course, \"Flame\" the whale we saw that day, put on a spectacular show for us all! What an experience this was! This tour was truly one of our best! Made our whole trip! I WILL definitely use this agency again when visiting Juneau!",
   "Excellent tour - I highly recommend this operator! The boat had a warm, comfortable cabin that offered very good viewing access. You could also view from outside the cabin and go up top where there were multiple areas from which to observe all the gorgeous scenery and of course whales!! We saw several whales and most of the sitings were close to our boat. Kudos to Capt. Dan for maneuvering close enough but not so close as to stress the whales. Our naturalists for the tour were Danielle and Sam - both were very enthusiastic, energetic and knowledgeable.  They were constantly checking with all of the guests to answer questions and help spot all of the wildlife! They were fabulous.  It was a very rainy day but they made it fun and completely worth the trip! The whole experience was well coordinated and required little effort on our part. Thank you!",
   "We had the best time on this tour! They keep the groups small, so you\u2019re not crowded together on one of those bigger boats. Chris, Amber and Jason did a fantastic job of finding the whales and teaching us several things about them. The boat is also well maintained and kept very clean. I would highly recommend booking with Juneau Whale Watch!",
   "Dave Danielle and Brendan were so personal and the captain is a great whale whisperer. He got us amazingly close to a couple of whales. Great info on the way out and back to shore. Even got to see some cute sea lions! ",
   "Danielle, Maddie, and Captain Dan are passionate, knowledgeable, and responsible about wildlife."

And our whale watching tour with Captain Kelly was a great success with many humpbacks really close up (they kept coming towards us!).",
   "This tour exceeded all of our expectations. Our tour guide was Britney, and she was fantastic - funny, knowledgeable, entertaining and informative. Our Captain was Captain Mac - and he was also fantastic and really knew where and how to find the whales and how to get the best photographs of them. He consistently positioned the boat to afford us the best lighting and backgrounds to photograph whales. Plus, he knew the local whales well, where to find them, and which ones would likely be the most active and interesting to watch and photograph.\n\nWe came to Alaska to see whales, and this tour delivers! They guarantee you will see whales on their tour, and we saw MANY, including a mother and calf. This was an educational, exciting, comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable experience. We cannot thank them enough to recommend them highly enough!\n\nI am including some photos with this review taken from my husband's iPhone.

Personal service- she took the time to get to know is and at least our names.  I got to pull in and throw out a crab pod. Lol. It was tiny but still!!!  I felt such a connection with the whales.  Not completely sure I would have on a bigger vessel. We saw a sea otter the guide had only seen twice the previous year. Her personal stories were great and tired everything together.  \n\nYou will NOT regret booking a tour with this company.\n\nWe loved Captain Todd and Richelle, our guide.  Thanks, y'all!  \n7/11/19"

   "Nice spot in town. Came on a whim off of the cruise ship. Food comes out in a timely manner and is pretty tasty. Good portion of avocado with the eggs benedict, too!! The potatoes that came with the dish we're perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nIf I come back, I'll be sure to try their baked goods.",
   "Delicious and great portion size. Loved the ambience and staff were so friendly. Highly recommend.",
   "Great coffee and breakfast with a funky, friendly vibe. Counter service, but food delivered to your table. Crowded and buzzy, mostly locals. They have a nice selection of pastries, along with cooked breakfasts - try the smoked salmon benedict.",
   "I go there every morning for my coffee.  Love the cool vibe and friendly people.  Always see someone I know.  A great place to start the day.",
   "Cute little cafe, my mocha was delicious! I ordered the eggs Benedict, they were good but not the best I\u2019ve ever had. The hollandaise sauce was a little different and it was kinda cold when I got it. Big portions, though."

   "Very cool place!  We were lucky in choosing the right tour which included this stop, but to be fair our guide really made it come alive.  However, the abundance of plant and forest was mind blowing.  The trails were in fantastic shape.  Easy to walk.  Wide enough to accommodate at least 4 adults shoulder to shoulder.  Several benches placed frequently throughout the trails we were on which helped those of us who needed a break every so often.  The totems were in good shape as well which gave us gawkers even more to appreciate."

I purchase my succulents there as well. They offer single plants and little groupings that look amazing year round. I am able to incorporate their curated vessels for both flowers and plants into my own decor. The gorgeous, boutique style store is fun to visit- it always lifts my spirits!",
   "I have used Frenchie's Floral Studio personally, and for my business for several years. I love this business! They offer a variety of services, including floral arrangement deliveries which is amazing for my busy schedule. I also love that they have a variety of prices available on floral arrangements- so I can always find something that fits my budget (whether it is a small gift bouquet or a show-stopping center piece).  You can call ahead and place an order OR just walk in! The staff is always super helpful and responsive and the arrangements are truly works of art.  I love working with Frenchies.",
   "I was so pleased to do business with Frenchie's Floral Studio! The customer service representative on the phone was so helpful and cheerful. I saw pictures of the bouquet  they sent to my sister in Juneau, AK and it was more beautiful than I could have ever imagined! Frenchie's not only made my sister\u2019s day, but  they made mine- all the way from Virginia! Thank you so much!",
   "Melissa is an energetic breath of fresh air. \nShe was very helpful in making my selection.  \nThe arrangement was delivered on the requested day and I received an email giving confirmation.   The recipient sent me a photo of an absolutely beautiful  floral arrangement.  She was delighted! \nWell done Frenchie's Floral Studio!!!",
   "I picked up flowers for Valentine's day. The store was lovely and I was very impressed when I learned that the store uses local floral sources. I also love that the store encourages people to reuse vases rather than buying new ones. Excellent customer service and assisted me in a timely manner. It was overall a very friendly environment. I loved that they mixed and matched flowers and customized my bouquet. It came out truly beautiful and unique."

   "Incredibly fantastic trip!  Captain Adam rocks it! We left at 8:00 and by 10:00 had caught our Halibut limit and both were extremely nice sized. We then headed to salmon waters where we had just as much fun catching salmon. We opted to head back in with enough time to catch some quality whale watching which turned out to be spectacular! Local Guy Charter works hard and strives to tailor the trip to your desires. This was our anniversary and Captain Adam made it special. He knows his fishing areas, and works hard to make sure you land em. Most highly recommend this outfit. When we come back, it\u2019s Local Guy Charter for us. Thank you Captain Adam!",
   "What an awesome trip!!  We caught our limit and when we returned to our cruise ship, we discovered that those who had taken the fishing charters that were offered on the ship, caught nothing!!  The ship would have charged us 4 times more and we would have experienced less!! Captain Adam and his deck hands (Samantha and Marcus) were wonderful with our autistic son and made sure that he had an amazing trip.  He took the time to visit seals, feed bald eagles, and learn about glaciers. As an educator myself, I know that Adam is the perfect teacher with his knowledge and enthusiasm.  I give him an A+!  I am also an amateur photographer and Adam took us places to get stunning photos! The afternoon on the Legacy was the highlight of our entire cruise!",
   "Adam is amazing!  We found him online and loved our day with him so much that we canceled the tour we had scheduled for the next day and went out with him again.  He is easy to talk to and is very knowledgable about the history of the area.  I have highly recommended his charter to all my friends who are traveling to that area.  You won't really experience this beautiful area until you book with him!!",
   "IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO GET RIPPED OFF, TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, and SWINDLED this is NOT the company for you. If you are looking for a knowledgeable guide who can put you on the fish, a captain who understands the time constraints dictated by cruise lines, AND the ability to get you back to ship in the unlikely event of boat trouble, Captain Adam is the guy of your wildest dreams and fantasies. Captain Adam and Deckhand Chris gave our group of 4 the best fishing trip imaginable. Not only did everyone catch multiple fish, but we saw orca whales, glaciers, and a sea otter. When we return to Juneau, this is our \u201cgo-to\u201d guy!"

   "My to go box was basically all white rice. So lame and super expensive. This happens all the time, all the Asian restaurants pile on the white rice, but skimp on the main dish. $14.95 for white rice, should have gone to Costco and bought my own bag.",
   "Its not a bad place to eat compared to the other asian orientated restaurants in Juneau. HOWEVER, you MUST be VERY SPECIFIC with your orders due to the fact there are many of the same recipes with different names, ESPECIALLY with the sushi menu AND Lunch \"specials\" where YOU MUST SAY its for lunch special you want, otherwise you'll be charged the more expensive version of the meals. They do wonders with their quality meat and amazing combination of flavors that don't ruin the rest the meal and they DO serve plenty of meat in the meals... if you decide on the SPECIFIC meal that has it. Most the time the 'different' meals are based on how much ingredients they add and just on how you pronounce the name (in english or in its native tongue) which will end up with a 20 dollar difference in paying per patron. Which if it comes to delivery, Little Tokyo with Asiana Gardens as back up, take out Seongs for the on the go local here in Juneau. LASTLY, THEY DO NOT DELIVER AND THEY WILL ONLY REMEMBER YOU IF YOU SKIP OUT ON A PICK UP and not a month straight up picking up the same 7 dollar meal with 5 dollar soda charged AND a 5 dollar tip. Good food, expedient service, first 5 minutes is friendly. Most you can ask for in a Tourism town based restaurant.",

They have a separate dinning room where people can rent it for parties. I had my work party there and it was amazing service. Susan was a great bartender. Highly reccomend them for any occasion.",

   "I recently had the Mexican buffet  and was very disappointed.  The rice was crunchy, the beans were unrecognizable, there were no chopped lettuce onions, tomatoes to garnish.  No salsa or chips or cheese. Just sour cream, sliced tomatoes and some green stuff in a bowl.  the other food items were also unidentifiable.  I recognized the chicken thighs and ate that.  If you set out a buffet you have to make sure the items are attended to.  Add salsa to the rice to keep it moist, put signs out to tell what each item is and have garnishes available.  Very disappointed.  Your regular menu is good. but the buffets are not.  Even the breakfast buffet was a let down when it was available.",
   "Food was really good. Our server Susan was very friendly and helped us with finding our way about town. Will definitely be back next time in Alaska.",
   "I've been coming here for their Sunday Brunch buffet off and on for a while.  I've noticed that they're ratching down on the quality of what they serve, staff turnover.  The last visit, they dialed down on their dessert offerings with danish and chocolates instead of more pies and cakes.\n\nOn the month of your birthday, they'll offer you a meal up to $25, but check."

There are also a slew of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, a rarity in this little town. \n\nDon't mind what others have said about poor customer service.

Keep on keeping on, Gonzo friends!",

In a place smaller than a container but barely bigger than a Ford F250 these girls whip up a limited set of ground salmon dishes from fish that were likely in the ocean just the day before.\n\nWhile super fresh an oh so tasty, I would have asked for my salmon burger without the cheese - my taste buds prefer their fish without cheese, hence my virgin tuna melts sans cheddar...\nThe baby salmon cakes are highly recommended, the burger fantastic (grab a heap of napkins from the stash under the umbrellas, you'll thank me later), the chowder ok, skip the make-it-yourself soft serve as twirling the perfect scoop is a lot harder than it looks and the ice cream softer than you want it - lick fast.",
   "Delicious, simple and easy!  There is a reason why the line stretched down the block but was well worth the wait.  \n\nIf only they could add some more seating on the patio!",
   "This place is wonderful. Great prices, excellent product. We tried one of everything. Everything was very good. The salmon burger was very flavorful and tender. The salmon patties are the perfect size and come with an amazing sauce, and the chowder tastes great and is probably perfect for a chilly day. The owners are friendly and local. I highly recommend the burger!",

Add in there an amazing view and you'll want to stay all night long. If you're looking for something lighter then head to the appetizer menu!",

The staff were phenomenal; attentive, friendly, courteous, kind, cheerful and a real pleasure to be around. The restaurant itself was beautiful inside and out, very pleasing astetically, and immaculately maintained. And now for the food. Everything on the menu looked amazing but it was unfortunate the inability to try it all. The wings were fantastic and the steak sandwich was.as.well. Their pizzas and toppings had me wishing I could somehow make more room. I will definitely be hanging out there with every visit to Juneau!!!",
   "One of the best restaurants in Juneau if not the best. They rotate their beers on tap and always have something different. Pizzas #1 on the menu but everything is rather tasty. I\u2019d recommend the salmon spread as appetizer and Perniola pizza (spelling?). Good service nice atmosphere good people. The newer Mikes Place for all you older Juneau locals"

   "I ordered their salmon burger, Juneau Glow( a ginger beer drink) and Bear Creek Strawberry Rhubarb(a wine). \n\n-I don't like that neither the person preparing the meal or the person taking my order could describe what flavor components were  on  the burger and instead just tried to describe what salmon taste like. Saying that it's a \"fishy fish\". I think anyone ordering salmon knows what it taste like. I'm trying to know what  the burger will taste like after you put whatever you're going to on it. But they couldn't understand that for whatever reason. The cook even had a  confused look on her face, which I couldn't understand. I think it would be very odd if no one has ever come here wanting to know what's on or in their meal. But I decided to give it a try anyway since I had a taste for salmon.\n\n-I felt that the salmon wasn't seasoned and that a lot more of the spread( whatever that may have been) should have been used on it.\n\n-The beans were really good and very well seasoned. So it's a bit shocking that the salmon wasn't.\n\n-The Juneau glow was one of the best drinks I've ever had in my life. I'm not a big drinker, I don't like regular beer and I don't like straight alcohol. I always go for a mixed drink and I was just saying earlier that day I want to find some ginger beer. So I was really happy when I saw this on the menu! It consists of lemon juice, blackberries, rose vodka and Ketel One Botanical grapefruit.\n\n-The strawberry rhubarb wine was a little bit too sweet for my taste. (Not their fault)\n\nI'd come back, I'd just try something else."

   "Best burger and fries in Juneau. Can get pretty busy in the summer, best to get there a bit before the noon rush. They frequently have great specials (brisket philly cheese steak, pulled pork poutine, chicken gyro, etc). However my favorite is the Husky Dawson (burger with onion rings and bacon) and the 3-way fries (french fries, sweet potato fries, and fried brussels sprouts). Enough to feed 2 people. Friendly service. The owner is great and very personable. Prices are a little high, but worth it for the taste and quality of food.",
   "Great food! Cowboy Sundae is wonderful! Short walk from the cruise ship docks.",
   "Burger is good, fries not, sitting outside might be alright when it's not raining, but we live in a temperate rain forest where it rains almost every day.",
   "Without question the best burger in Juneau. Deserves six stars.",
   "Delicious food, good pricing and fast service."

   "The chicken stew plate was good!",
   "We had a two hour layover in Juneau so we thought to walk somewhere for lunch. Took about ten minutes to walk there but was worth it. The bacon empanada was phenomenal. I assume it's a new item because it wasn't on the menu but it probably will be soon.  I also had the chicken stew thing and that was so flavorful and delicious. Definitely going there again next time I fly through.",
   "Four plates has 4 main dishes on the menu, we ordered the first, a savory and simple chicken potato stew, served with rice. Everything was a huge portion, the staff were friendly and happy to answer questions. The dish was well seasoned, but didn\u2019t have the intense flavors/spice of Mexican food, the potatoes and chicken were tender. We also had a Caesar salad (huge amount of salad) and a churro for dessert, all of which I would recommend.  I had no expectations and left very full and happy!",

   "Bbq and dinuguan is the best you can eat in Bernadette's Fast Food. Amazingly located in Juneau Alaska. Thanks to cruise ship and because of pinoy seaman crew members who missed so much eating pinoy dishes the only place I go since before is this fast food. They have a satellite food stall by the park where most Filipino crew members are lining up to have their popular bbq combo either shanghai with dinuguan even with papaitan. Even foreign nationals or American are curious to have the bbq as the smoke smells all over the place. They also sometimes have free donuts or desserts that make you surprise. Wifi is also available and other filipino dishes are also served. Please come visit Them!",

   "Their meatball pho was very good and tasty.\n\nThe chef/cook doesn't have the basic cooking skills mastered: cooking protein.  The shrimp in their tempura was overcooked, rubbery.  To add insult to injury, they served the rubbery, overcooked tempura with sweet and sour sauce instead of a tempura dipping sauce.  How unauthentic and a disgraceful to Japanese cuisine.\n\nThe same people also own Asians Garden in the valley, and Little Tokyo also downtown a short distance away.  The same low bar - overcooked protein, pork in the katsu.  If you have no connotation, ignorant, or just don't care, come over and dine at this inferior establishment in ignorant bliss.",

I called the restaurant directly and the sweet woman over the phone was nice enough to take my order for me, discounted an item after the side dish I wanted was no longer available, and offered to deliver it to me after they closed for the day so I still got my food. I was so happy with the service, I had to give them a review. Thanks for helping extending help to us locals at such a trying time in our world!",
   "Udder Culture best deal is their half a sandwich and a cup of soup daily special.  You may order generally any two meats, two cheeses, exception of bacon, a refill on your cup of soup until they run out, so to get the best possibility, come by 13:00 as their soups run out.  They have shrimp croissant on Wednesdays and Fridays.  They have nonfat or lowfat frozen yogurt.  Baked potato is available.",
   "My sandwich could have been better, but the service was nice. I like the updated decor and food options. I was afraid the Udder Culture vibe would be lost with the new owners, but it's pretty much stayed the same. Except the milkshakes aren't the same.",
   "So I have to start by saying this review is over 20 years in the making. I moved to Juneau in 1993 and sometime there after I had the creamy split pea soup and it changed my life. I, literally, to this day remark about that split pea soup. No split pea soup has ever compared to it. I am reviewing the cafe from when I knew it. But reading reviews it sounds like its the same. Kudos to you guys! I've traveled the world now and can say I STILL have not had a better split pea soup.",

After conquering my fear of getting on a helicopter (and safely landing), we decided to go back the same night for dinner. This time we celebrated with Alaskan king crab, cocktails and dessert.

   "Best new breakfast place in Juneau.  Very clean and neat kitchen and staff prompt service.  I ordered chicken fried steak it was hands down the best I've had in Juneau.  The steak was cooked perfectly with a crunch and the country gravy with sliced smoked sausage took it over the top.  Hash browns were crunchy eggs over easy toast and coffee  were perfect hot and delicious...",
   "Breakfast and lunch served from 0600 to 1400, dinner served Sunday through Thursday from 1700-2100, Friday and Saturday 1700-2200.  Alcohol purchases are charged on a separate credit card charge only for the reason the Frontier Suites Hotel holds the beer and wine license.\n\nEnter the restaurant through the Frontier Suites lobby immediately to your left.  Check to see what their white board specials are upon entering.  One of the white board specials is pork liempo never heard of before, pork belly that's succulent.  It came with pancit, rice, and supposedly lumpia which didn't come and I didn't noticed until later reviewing my photographs.  There was chicken breast meat in the pancit that was overcooked, dry.  The white rice was nice and fluffy though brown rice is healthier.",

   "Unhealthy food except the salad, tables to stand by or sit outside while consuming your food.  Hot dog and soda for a great price.",
   "The customer service is spot on but it often takes 10-15 minutes to get to the front of the line. Way too long for a lunch break. \n\nIf management could hire additional staff, adapt the new computer ordering system (like anchorage), or did another way to save time it would be well appreciated.",
   "Costco food court has the best prices on hot dogs in town. Dollar fifty plus a soft drink can't beat it.",
   "Very good food.",
   "The food is great for what you pay. It's a small food court, way smaller than what you would find in other stores down south."

   "Great coffee and I like the discount for bringing your own cup.  If you forget it, they do use biodegradable cups.   I wonder if they will start composting soon???",
   "Best coffee I have had in Juneau. Friendly service.",
   "I came in at 7:00 to get coffee and a breakfast sandwich. I was told the cook wouldn't be there for a half hour. I ordered a coffee and waited. After a half hour I ordered a sandwich and sat down and waited. After 15 minutes I came back to ask what happened to the sandwich. It was sitting on the shelf getting cold. No one called me to pick it up nor did they deliver it to me. No apology. No compensation. Worst of all, they already got their tip as you have to add a tip when you pay up front. The coffee was okay. The sandwich was tasty (would have been nicer to eat it fresh) so I'll give two stars. They really need to improve customer experience. I won't be back.",
   "Customer service and drink consistency could use a bit of work, but overall the place has a nice vibe to it.\nIt would be much better if you could get the staff to open their doors on time. I counted 8 people walk away the other morning because the girl working inside didn't unlock the front door. Finally, Melissa, another employee who was on crutches at the time, went over and opened the door and started greeting the people waiting...half an hour after the shop was supposed to be open. \nIt could be a fluke, but it seems pretty bad to me when someone on crutches, that's not even scheduled to be working that day, has to hobble over and struggle to do your job for you. Nice Job Melissa! Hire more people like her!",
   "I am an educator, producer, and entrepreneur. I have a BFA, MS, and numerous credentials. My boyfriend and I walked into this coffee shop to buy something to drink and use WiFi as we are on a cruise and were walking around Juneau checking out the sites. As my boyfriend was still using the wifi I accidentally drifted off to sleep. A police officer came up to us, demanded if we had bought something and told us we could not lounge or sleep. I apologized to him in that it was an accident. He was very rude and I would hate to think his approach was because we were people of color. We were the only people of color in the shop. We do not look homeless at all. Pretty cool shop, but the obvious disrespect and possible racism we just experienced is unacceptable. Please advise when making your decision to visit this establishment."

   "\ud83d\ude01 The most popular diner among Filipino crews in any cruise ship while at this port of call.",
   "Boba drinks are not a slush or worth 5.00. I was disappointed",
   "Great boba slushes, A+ burgers, got to eat in a tent",
   "I walked up and tried to decide what I wanted. I got a dumpling with meat in it and it was delicious, but I was appalled at the price, I also received a Thai tea and if you've had Thai tea around Juneau AK you know good Thai tea and this tea was just gross, and so not worth the price. Lastly and sadly I love lumpia and this was the most pitiful lumpia as the vegetables outweighed the meat. It comes with 2 for 3$ and some change took a bite and was disappointed to find no meat at all and what little bits of ground beef I hardly had. Would not recommend eating here.",
   "Great burger"
