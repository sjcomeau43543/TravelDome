   "The animals are an amazing sight to see. There was an area were you can pet goats, the goats were peaceful creatures. A rhinoceros area is coming in summer, 2020. The most fun I had was called the ropes. The ropes got your adrenaline going. Trust me you will not want to get off of it. I totally recommend  going to Riverbanks Zoo & Garden.",
   "I grew up with a Riverbanks Zoo pennant on my wall most of my young life.  My parents brought me there and I totally enjoyed it.  Few years back we were in the area visiting family and we saw they were doing Boo at the Zoo.  We kind of plan for it on our way down bringing our costumes.  We had a great time.  The park was all decorated for Halloween.  The exhibits were too.  It is a great zoo!  Lots to see and do, barely can do all in 1 day.  Take your time, check out their schedule and try to attend some of the cooler things.  You can't go wrong here!",
   "Although it is most recommendable to come in the spring, especially when you're heavy on loving different array of flowers. The Riverbank Zoo & Garden sure had its perks through sightseeing and attractions. I especially loved how all of your coworkers and trainers there are so passionate in their workings with each animals that were featured there! It was sweet as it was exciting!",
   "Loved every minute of our visit. Animals are happy and in clean environments. Staff are friendly and very informative. The Botanical Garden is beautiful. Even in February. Definitely a great place to visit.",
   "The place was awesome. They have the most incredible reptile exhibit. Husband and I loved it more than the tots. The place is super clean as well as the I called animal housing was really clean. I'd recommend it to everyone"

He was very helpful and I appreciate the research he did on my behalf. This is a great military museum hidden behind the state armory. I will definitely be back in to take a longer stroll through all the exhibits!",
   "Nice museum that honors our wonderful military history. Very informative. They could have better signage along the main road to attract more visitors.",
   "Great museum! This was a quick stop with four boys on the way to TN... boys were ages 2 - 12 all liked getting to see the pieces this museum has including the mechanized display they have",
   "Amazing displays from revolutionary wars to the Iraq war including information on 9/11. Uniforms from different eras. Mostly Army and some Air Force. Military equipment ranging from helicopters to tanks! Spoke with a retired Army volunteer who made models of Amy equipment from tanks to transport equipment. Very impressed of what I saw definitely ranks high amongst all the large museums.",

   "First time in this museum, so much to learn from here \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc  good service, good attention, professional staff, everything is clean, very colorful. You\u2019ll find out a lot about South Carolina History, the time transition from the past to present, about the colonial government, you\u2019ll see many maps. This museum it\u2019s about science, society, culture, etc. This museum is amazing place for the kids to see and ask questions, the have the chance and the opportunity to ask and to be curious, we all can learn so much, I love this place and I recommend to come visit with the whole family I\u2019ll come again for sure, because you can see about the revolution and evolution, you can see old routes that\u2019s good for google map and on some on my pictures check it. In this museum museum you\u2019ll see cool things like old transportation, you can find few theaters, it\u2019s a big museum. It\u2019s a caf\u00e9 place Check all my pictures, let me know what you think, hit like to all of them \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
   "We came for the NASA exhibit, but we're really surprised at how great the other exhibits were. We saw two shows, one at the 4D theater and one in the planetarium. Both were great and the kids loved them.\n\nThe museum features four stories of various themed exhibits, including the NASA and Apollo exhibit, fossils and dinosaurs, and South Carolina history. There was also a Sherlock Holmes feature, but we did not explore that because our children didn't seem interested. I was surprised at the amount of things to explore and we spent a good amount of the day here, which is more than I can say for the EdVenture museum across the parking lot.",
   "So this was my first time at this museum ever. I truly enjoyed myself and the exhibits. I got to see one of the planetarium shows as well and that was definitely fun to do. We were there for 2 or 3 hours and still didn't see everything. I look forward to the next time we visit though.",
   "Very clean and organized. I loved that they had several elevators for our stroller and for handicapped folks. The staff was very friendly and the exhibits were fascinating. The thing I liked most was there was a family room on the bottom floor that was available for nursing moms.",
   "Saw 4D Sherlock Holmes cartoon movie. 3D and additional 4D effects were GREAT. \nBeing a Member has many Benefits. Plenty of parking.  Fully HANDICAPPED ACCESSIBLE, elevators make it very easy to navigate the 4 floors."

   "Always love visiting the zoo! Just a nice stroll through the gardens and down to see the animals!\nLove making memories with the family at Riverbanks!  Weather was PERFECT! The animals were out playing with each other, and we were able to get some great pictures!",
   "We always have a great time at the zoo and botanical gardens! There's a lot more for kids to do and see at the gardens since our last trip about 3 years ago. Our family really enjoyed visiting this weekend!",
   "The gardens are somewhat small in comparison to some of the other attractions on the property. The fact that they are connected to Riverbanks Zoo (by tram or short walk) is a huge plus. Doing both in a single visit is doable, but makes for a long day. Definitely a good way for the kids to burn some energy.",
   "Fantastic layout. I love to see all of the well kept plants, flowers and trees. We enjoy stopping in whatever we can."

   "This is one of the things we love about Columbia and it's getting better. Expansions are going to be stellar and help Cola stand out. Rushing waters can be viewed along the way, but now there are even chairs and hammocks to relax in. A great way to spend a couple hours and get some exercise too.",
   "More for dogs rather then people... the only bathroom is at the front of the trail. Im pregnant and pee a lot so I couldn't get very far down the trail without having to turn around. Please make other facilities available. Saw a lot of doggy bag stations... they are not the only ones who have to go!",
   "Gorgeous free river walk! There are trails along the river with tables on overlooks, Spanish moss hanging from the trees, and a really nice area with hammocks and Adirondack chairs.  What a great way to spend the afternoon close to the downtown area.",
   "Riverfront Park was great when it opened in 1986, but unfortunately city of Columbia parks and rec is unable to manage our park system properly.  The roads are crumbling, the signs are falling down, parts are closed off.  It's just a mess.  That said if you want to get out and take a run its a nice place to go as long as you get there before it gets crowded."

   "This place is an incredible gem in Columbia. Possibly the best children's museum I've ever visited. My four kids were all engaged and busy for the whole 6 hours we were there, and they could happily have stayed for hours more. If you have kids, this is a must-see in Columbia. If you live here, it's one hundred percent worth the membership!",
   "Two year old son had a blast.  He found a friend to play with and the experience was wonderful.   As a pilot and former volunteer fire fighter, the exhibits were great.  Only problem was that the thrust levers on the 757 didn't advance for takeoff.",
   "A great day adventure with many different educational adventures. Food court had great food at reasonable prices, all staff was very friendly and there seemed like so much to do. Highly recommend if you have children and have never been!",
   "Our three year old really enjoyed it, but our eight year old was bored. There really isn't enough here to engage an older kid. We were disappointed that despite the large outward appearance of the building, there really wasn't much to keep our kids occupied for an extended time. I had expected to spend half a day here, but we struggled to stay more than an hour without revisiting areas.\n\nI don't really agree with the pricing, either. We paid for two adults and two kids, but after our experience, I wondered what exactly it is the adults are expected to enjoy? It's not like a science museum where people of all ages are encouraged to interact with the exhibits. There's nothing for a parent to do, other than follow the kids around. Certainly, most of the crawling areas can barely accommodate a grown man like myself. Overall, I think the experience was overpriced.",
   "As a retired Veteran, I enjoy the opportunity to spend more quality time with my family after 20 years of service. Our children asked to go to the Children's Museum, so my wife Tamara Pierre and I took our family (ages 5, 8 and 10) to EdVenture Children\u2019s Museum and we all had an amazing time. My children's favorite activity is the Publix grocery store. They REALLY do enjoy shopping! (I wonder where they get that from!!! \ud83d\ude0f)\n\nI especially enjoyed playing hockey and interacting with all the children. At first it was just a couple of us playing, and before I knew it... there were 6 kids (of all ages) vs. ME!!! \ud83d\ude0e Don't worry folks... I got this!!\n\nMy 5 year old Elite Jr. (in the black jacket) is a very timid and socially awkward child. This was his first time playing such an aggressive sport with so many bigger kids. All the kids were very kind and helpful allowing him to take shots too.\n\nAfter organizing a short game right before closing, the kids won 4 to 1. \ud83d\ude1f\n\nAll of the parents of the other children thanked me for organizing the game and playing with the kids. One mother even pulled me aside and asked me to apply for a job to work as an Educator at the museum. She was so impressed by how I engaged with the children, she said, \"I'd hire you in a minute!\"\n\nI applied for the position today! Wish me luck!"

   "Visited this establishment with my whole family. Our group consisted of my wife, my three daughters (ages 13,11, and 8), and myself. We chose to do the Down the Rabbit hole room. We were able to just barely escape with mere minutes remaining with a little bit of help from the overseer. The overseer did help more than I would have liked but clearly we needed every bit of help to finish on time. For the room itself it was fantastically themed and the puzzles had a lot of variety to theme. I will definitely be returning to try the other rooms!",
   "Mitsy was the best! She scared us and made it great! This was our 3rd escape room with them. All our experiences were great! We beat 2 rooms and lost 1 room. This experience is worth the money!",
   "We did Down the Rabbit Hole room and it was so clever!  We absolutely loved it. We've done escape rooms in other states and this place was one of our favorites.  Noah, The Mad Hatter, was hilarious. He was entertaining in his part and made the whole experience that much better.",
   "We had a ton of fun in The Sacrifice tonight.  The atmosphere at The Final Door was amazing, out Game Master (Mitchell) was wonderful, and the room was the perfect mix of fun and challenging. As soon as you walk in the building, you feel like you've stepped into a different world, and I can't wait to try out the other rooms."

I would recommend looking at their website and seeing what exhibit is in town so that you can pick something that you are interested in seeing and skipping what you're not interested in. \nThe stationary exhibits are also very lovely."

The market, alone, is amazing though! If you don\u2019t have anything to do, you can always count on the Soda City market to be in full swing every Saturday! Such a great community building event for Columbia!",

By the way, I did not follow my on advice. May who needs electricity anyway I have a hand carved wooden bowl it's beautiful",

It will take you a few weeks, a few months even (if you aren't a pig like me lol) to get through all the food truck/vendors but it is SO worth it!! There is a fresh fruit and vegetable market, which is really cool. There are also some regular vendors selling products. One we really liked was Wag More Collars \u2764\ud83d\udc3e The staff were friendly and amazing and the collars and bows were beyond beautiful!

It started raining when we went to play mini golf, so they gave us a refund of our money. I've been back a few times. Expect to spend quite a bit of money when you come tho.

The guide was very informative and always asked if we had questions. Great Costomer service all around. The price for a guided tour is $10 a person and well worth it.",

   "Went for the Sherlock Holmes tour. So much fun, from 8years old to 61years . We all found something fun",
   "An excellent opportunity to view the best collection of War Between the States artifacts in world.",
   "Absolute must for a Historian!! Great exhibit, easy to get to, took awhile to read and navigate exhibit. Did not bother me at all!! Many photos, flags and testimonials from Civil War veterans!! You will not be disappointed",
   "This was a fun museum and my fiance and I really enjoyed checking out all the exhibits. The museum itself is comprised of 4 separate stories, each story containing 3-5 different exhibits. There are also there different shows you can attend if you get the \"Master Explorer Ticket\" which cost approximately $12 per adult including a 4D show, a planetarium show, and an exhibit show. It was a fun day and we really enjoyed our experience. The ONLY reason this is getting 3 stars is due to my experiences with museum trips in cities such as San Diego, Washington D.C., and Norfolk which are vastly larger as would be expected."

   "This park has the best trails around for any activity. I go here to run and bike the trails. There's only so much that the Midlands have to offer in terms of terrain, so after that is taken into consideration this is a five star place to be. For bikes the biggest challenge in the area can be to find areas with decent trails and no deep sand. Harbison has basically no sandy problem areas and the riding is flowing and fast. As a trail runner I enjoy running different routes and not covering the same trails more than once. There's tons of miles to run on here and the other day I ran a half marathon here in my training. I thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and we'll maintained trails.",
   "I absolutely love this trail system. Always have some of my most memorable runs here.",
   "Always enjoyed walking the trails with the buddies back in the day! Went there recently and still as beautiful and fun to walk as back then! Highly recommend!",
   "It's a great forest. What more is there to say? It's good that with such a short drive you can be in the woods enjoying nature.  The drawback is that you can still hear alot of the sounds of the city life but I'll take that for some easy access hiking. The forest is pretty flat over all. There's plenty of trails to choose from to get a nice quick hike in or to spend the day on.",
   "Every time I come through Columbia, I make it a point to mountain bike at Harbison State Forest. The trails are well maintained and they seem to drain quickly after a rain (though, you may want to check with a LBS instead of taking my word on that). They have a bike wash station with a couple of brushes to help keep the boys of the park in the park instead of going home with you. There is also a pair of dog bowls with water for your furry friend. Trail dogs are welcome do long as you keep them leashed. Unfortunately, there is no bathroom at the trail head. If you have to go, you'll need to head down the trail to one of the pit toilets. \n\nThere is parking, but I've found that it can get crowded on the weekends.\n\nCost to play is $5/day or $25/year. Will worth it!"

   "Beautiful area! In the garden area my eyes were wondering everywhere with all the beautiful flowers and designs all around. My kids absolutely LOVED the play area in the back. Had a dinosaur fossil digging area, little clubhouses, big tree house to walk in, waterpark area, grassy area for them to run around, cool little tunnels, But that's just the stuff that I remember! I think I could come in the summer and the family would probably just stay in the Waterfall Junction area the whole time! Oh and I like the little hike you can take (optional) in order to make it to this part of the Zoo.",
   "Lots to do but kids like to walk fast and still fall on the slick cement. They really need to change the flooring. We stayed with our kids the whole time but kept helping other kids up.\nKids were falling everywhere and busting heads and faces. \nLike that alcohol is available but way over priced and food is zoo food so again pricey for old stail chips.",
   "Great place for a family staycation. The Zoo has more than enough to keep your animal lovers entranced, and the splash pad provides a cool respite from the heat",
   "Such a nice, aesthetically-pleasing area for families to enjoy and cool off during a visit to the zoo & gardens. We were very impressed by the features and plan to visit many more times. There is a smaller area for young children, games on the lawn, seating, refreshments & snacks, etc....all in one spot! We loved Waterfall Junction!",

It seems years ago there was a water feature stroke element but this is now broken on the sculpture.\n\nAlso check out the mural nearby.",

A nice walk a little bit out of downtown, not far at all, yet it reveals a more calm and natural side of the city.\n\nIt is close to the edventure museum for kids, so it is good for a family walk.",

   "So this is a cute little water park close to home. My husband is a disabled vet so I am unsure about civilians with no military affiliations being allowed on. The process was simple the life guards are everywhere watching after the kids. And there is a little something for all ages. This is not by any means a large park but def fun. No outside food or beverages band if you have a cwp you still cannot being firearms on base. All looks to be fairly clean. Def a nice time to spend with family",
   "While the kids enjoyed this my concern would be how hot the wood was even with mats over top it was scaulding to walk on and when you tried to hurry they blew the whistle at you for running. \nI did appreciate how the lifeguards actually did their job and kept things running smoothly. But I also think they were a little too aggressive in some instances.",
   "My kiddos and I love it! Return several times! Small but fun, lifeguards always on point! The price for entry is low, and food is inexpensive but good! I would also like to share today's experience. Shout out to management! As I was leaving a family was trying to come in with a dachshund but couldn't bring it in. So the older man and little girl took it back to the car and left it! Then the family tried buy tickets to cool off from the 96 degree day! The park DENIED them entry because they didn't want the dog left in car! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc36"

Fishing, running, walking, hiking, biking, bird watching, canoeing, a dog park, playgrounds, a splash pad, an athletic complex; outdoor activities are pretty well covered. Then of course they have the locally famous holiday lights, a jazz music series, and they host a variety of events.\n\nNo place is perfect, but I have found that the administration is very conscientious about addressing issues that are brought to their attention. The staff seem invested in keeping the park in good shape. Visitors to the park are a fairly diverse bunch, and most of the folks that I've met who are first timers plan on returning.\n\nI brought my kids here to do their homework and play when they were little.

I love the turf so kids can be safe and as care free to able to just worry about playing ( which should be every kids only responsibility). My daughter had a blast running up and down the ramp. I love the fact that its made also for kids that may have disabilities or not capable of using their motor skills normally. I love the over look of the small pond which is guarded with a fence and the small waterfall that just relaxes the atmosphere. I really love everything about it.",
   "I've always loved coming here for walks and fishing. Recently we bought the fisherman's pass for my husband. $65 and we can go 24hrs. No more $5 parking. The pass is 100% worth the money. Also if you have little ones the splash pad is wonderful. Its $3 for each person. They have so many different sprinklers. Just watch for the bigger kids and don't forget sunscreen. They have picnic tables and a playground right next to it. It makes for a perfect family day.",
   "Love this area.  Kayaking with old friends. My friend Shawn took me here.  Rip.   He had a season pass and we would kayak.  Walk the dogs.  Have lots of fun",
   "A great place to walk by yourself or with your dog.  Trails are paved and wide.  There are also dirt trails off the paved trail that you can go right up to the river.",
   "I absolutely love the new Leo's Landing park! It's amazing to finally have an affordable, all inclusive play location for children in Columbia!  It has something for everyone. I could even see it being a great location to have an Occupational Therapy field trip! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this park. \n\nSaluda Shoals was fun to visit before Leo's Landing; so many trails, a splash pad, river access, etc. But Leo's Landing is definitely our favorite part now! Thank you for providing a safe place to play for our community."

   "I love this place. It's peaceful. There are restrooms. Check for TP before you sit! Not always clean because not everyone received the same home training and they abuse the privilege.\nThere are paved asphalt trails that run along the canal and there are sidewalk trails that run along a portion of the Broad River that feeds the canal. It's a great place for exercising, strolling, or taking pictures. Some people get in the water at the river. There is no lifeguard and this is not recommended! Don't do this!\nThe canal trail is connected to the Riverfront Park. Partially shaded along portions of the trail. Great views!\nParking usually isn't a problem. Do not leave any valuables in your car. Do not leave your car unlocked. Do not leave anything visible in your car either. Again, not everyone has home training and there is no video surveillance.",

   "Get place to play around of disc golf. Well kept. And plenty of parking. Has a nice picnic area as well. It is handicap ramps as well. Baseball fields are well maintained. It has a kids park as well recommended age is 12 but i think younger kids would like it as well.",
   "This is a nice little neighborhood park. I enjoy walking my dogs here in the fall. This is an ICRC park, so it is pretty well kept. There is a semiannual bulletin that is mailed out to residents in the area detailing seasonal activities. I haven't been in the main building, the Leisure Center, very often in the last few years because I don't go to the park to be indoors. The last time I was in there was right after the renovations a few years back. It was a nice looking facility at the time.\n\nThere are several athletic fields here, I often see youth sports teams practicing. Frisbee golf is popular, there is a nice course here. There are picnic shelters, playgrounds, and trails to walk as well. A stream runs along one edge of the park, basically separating it from the neighborhood behind. There is a bridge that allows you to cross over.\n\nParking is typically not an issue, they have two large lots. There are restrooms available down by the athletic fields and of course, in the Leisure Center. There isn't a lot of light in the park area at night unless the athletic fields are in use, but the area around the Leisure Center is well lit.",
   "I very regularly go here to play a casual round of disc golf. Very nice facility. One thing to keep in mind is that the ground doesn't absorb water very well, so even days after a rain, the place is very wet and muddy. \n\nThere's very nice playground equipment here as well, so it's a great place to bring the younger family. Ball fields surround the area. Multiple parking lots. Also a recreation center. ( I haven't been inside this one)\n\nThe park is part of Irmo Chapin recreation.\n\nI love this park!",
   "The playground is nice, and layered with recycled tires so no worry of splinters like with some parks. Not a lick of shade so it's almost impossible to stay very long considering it doesn't open until 2pm, when it's the most hot during the day.",

If owners are responsible you can keep accidents from happening if they aren't fixed. Other than that I absolutely LOVED the place itself and it's amenities.",
   "All the bad reviews are super dumb. It\u2019s a great place for $30 a year. Yes, your dogs need to be up to date on shots. Probably not a bad idea.",
   "I do not have a dog, but was here on business.   There are wide open places for dogs to run, and even a place where they can jump into the creek.  Plenty  of parking. Looks like a good place for puppies to have fun!",
   "My Beagle loves the new playground equipment!",
   "Been a member for the 3rd year. LOVE THIS PARK! All breeds of dogs and people. Is a comfort to know that ALL the dogs have had their shots and there will never be accidental puppies. And all are registered with the city."

Extremely nice with that one exception. Law enforcement was traveling down trail on four wheelers. Another plus.",
   "Great place to walk, run, or ride your bike. Signage could be a little better. Wish they had mile markers.",
   "My family biked over 7 miles here yesterday and we all loved it! Even though it had been raining for several days prior, the trails were in good shape and safe. The woods and trails are beautiful and give you the sense that you're away in the mountains. We saw a deer and two snakes along the river bank along with your typical woodland birds and squirrels. The trails are wide enough to pass others without fear of running one another off the path. The park IS pet friendly. There are multiple parking areas, so do be sure to check signage if you're meeting up with others. This is an awesome (and not overly crowded) place to go on a date, have a family outing or just exercise alone. Although I have not personally been in the evenings I did notice that they have ample lighting and emergency call boxes. There are picnic tables and benches, so it's a lovely place to get your picnic on. I have been twice and definitely plan to return.",
   "Very nice paved path. Good for walking Poppa. Hiking and bike as well",
   "Great trail to walk, run, or bike. Make sure you bring water. There are no restrooms on the trail. Shady paved trail paths and scenic river views. Several bridges to walk over as well. The trail extends to neighborhood in Cayce that connects to another section of the trail that has been closed since the Oct flood a few years ago. The trail paths are wider than most paved trails which makes it better for biking. The trail is maintained, and free of debris. There is also a trail that leads to the creek for canoe access. The trail head is also easy to find and beautiful in the Spring and Fall."

   "2.5 mile boardwalk, just reopen today because of flooding. Flooding is a understatement, The water was feet high above the trees. Remnants of the park benches being underwater are very visible. Lots of birds and wildlife. The trees were absolutely amazing! ** this is a must do!!",
   "Great for family walks and picnics. Great for little ones. Just pack a snack and being your camera. There is sometimes flooding so tennis shoes or boots are advised! Go into the visitor center and also do some Geocaching! (Download the app)",
   "A short boardwalk makes up the easy hiking portion of this park. There are backcountry trails with views of lakes and trees. Some nice features like tree 'knees' and good views of the water. It is fairly quiet in the later hours of the day and a good time to feel like you are surrounded by nature. Check if the floodplain has flooded the trails before you go."

It's fully handicap accessible and the view is nice, been there many times never had a bad one.. at the park that is!",
   "We go to the park often and we love it for a walking exercise. However the walking trail is in need of repair as roots from trees have formed large cracks in the walk path. Be careful especially with little ones.",
   "This park is beautiful and unique! There are two play structures and plenty of swings for all ages go children. I love how it\u2019s tight in the middle of downtown yet with all the trees it feels like a little oasis. The police station is right by the parking lot which provides and additional peace of mind. I have kids ranging in ages from 12-2 and they all enjoy what Virginia Hylyon has to offer. This is the best park in the area by far!"

Midway through the meal someone hit a transformer and all the lights went out on the whole block. We ended up eating in the dark. I would have given this restaurant 5 stars because they could have compensated us with like a free dessert on the next visit or 10% off of our meal. It was not there fault but we where ear eating in the dark. They did provide tea lit candles but they did not provide much lighting. So for that reason they get a 3 star.",

The food never misses the mark. I visited last night for dinner and our waitress was less than attentive and the food took forever to come out. We continuously had to request things like bread and refills that other tables seemed to get with no issue.",

The cuisine is something I've never experienced before, I had herbed grits and beef spare ribs the first visit.

This place ranks very high with me.",

   "I was passing through SC for a special event and Saluda was a wonderful Cap to the night. Fine dining meets Southern Comfort with a charm that will whisk you away. The appetizers were delightfully original. I was in love with the Shrimp and Grits because the dish is packed with more surprises and flavor then the name suggests. Lastly, the red wine velvet cake was to die for. YOU MUST DINE HERE!",
   "Delicious!! But very expensive. Definitely a special treat place. I had the fish of the day and it was probably the best fish I've ever had. My boyfriend loved the pork chop. The sweet potato hash and Brussel sprouts AMAZING and the pumpkin cheesecake HEAVENLY",
   "Wonderful evening. Wonderful space. Wonderful service. Wonderful food. On an unexpectedly busy mid-week evening, we were treated to great service and great food. I had the pork chop. She (a vegetarian) had the stuffed acorn squash. Both cooked and presented expertly. Strong wine list to complement our food.",
   "Booked a table for busy parents weekend far in advance and then needed to change the time AND number of guests. They were great! Let me add 3 people and change our time. Food was excellent. Everyone ordered something different and everyone raved about their dinner. I had shrimp and grits were the best he\u2019s ever had (sorry, Bobby Flay) and daughter\u2019s steak was perfectly cooked. Waitress recommended the steak special (can\u2019t remember the exact name) and everyone who ordered it loved the choice. I would definitely go back on next visit to Columbia.",
   "Great food, great service. Very accommodating to allergies. Excellent wine selection, good beer selection, and nice atmosphere."

   "Delicious, smoked BBQ! When you can smell it cooking outside, you know it's gotta be good inside! Loved the brisket and love they allow you to choose what pieces you like and how well it's cooked. Wait staff was friendly, very accommodating, and shared info on their different house made sauces and allowed me to try each! Will definitely go again! Food was good, wait was short for a Saturday night. My extended family and I all loved the dishes. The cornbread is a must!",
   "Long wait times with no real area to wait is my only real issue... the food is consistently fantastic and the burnt ends are some of the best I have had in SC... this is a good place",
   "The food comes out fast here! Fast but still hot and good. They do a lot of take out because people kept coming to pickup food and I don't blame them because it's GOOD! Great flavor and good portions. I had the small Carolina Pork plate with Hash & Rice as the side kick to the pork. Hush puppies and some cucumber, onion, and jalape\u00f1o pepper slaw thingy (trust me this thingy tastes great!). I inhaled all of this down real fast because I was hungry and not greedy. Oh I can't forget the service. Great service with a side of smiles. The draft beer is fresh clean, cold and refreshing. I hate getting draft beer from some places and it has a sour taste! Not here... It's good. Well that's about it... About it for this review but not for the food. I ordered some smoked & crispy wings to go. Again because I'm hungry and NOT greedy...",
   "It here on our road trip back from Florida to Canada. Definitely glad we made the stop because the food was amazing and the mac and cheese was even better! My boyfriend and I had the pig out which was more than enough food for the both of us. I would stop in if you're looking for a good barbecue\ud83d\ude42",
   "A solid BBQ place.  Good food, good prices.  I've been there for weekend and weekday lunches. The service and food was the same for both; definitely a place that can turn tables with a crowd. The bacon wrapped jalapenos were some of the best I've ever had.  The menu doesn't have nutrition information, but you can still make some smart choices -- and if that's not your thing, you can certainly go unhealthy!  Overall a solid choice."

I am certainly not a fan of oysters but if I were, I can imagine I would have enjoyed these. The prices were in between expensive and cheap so there was something for everyone's. I will visit again.",

   "WOW...Food and staff were fabulous! Wife & I ordered several items off the Happy Hour Menu (until 7:00). We will definitely be back. Little bit of a drive for us but we'll make an exception.",
   "Enjoyed a wonderful dinner today at Pearlz. We came in right after 4 on a Friday with no wait and were seated immediately. We were met with a kind and knowledgeable waitress who recommended the Crab Dip appetizer which was full of flavor and by itself a respectable portion. After ordering the Shrimp and Grits by the waitresses recommendation I was greater by a beautifully presented plate with creamy filling grits and flavorful breaded shrimp that gave a nice crunch to the dish. The music selection was good and the lowlight setting gave the place a tasteful ambiance. I look forward to coming again to this great restaurant",

Our last visit wasn't the best so we decided to give them another shot and they did not disappoint. The dusted Oysters app was superb, followed by a great soup and then we split the special Halibut. Incredible dinner and excellent service. Glad to know we will be back as this is one of our favorite restaurants in Columbia.",
   "The atmosphere is super chill. Very simple yet sophisticated. The food was fantastic. The service is excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",
   "Too often will restaurants treat to-go lunch salads too lightly. Pun intended, no one likes 95% lettuce and 5% toppings. You know the salad I'm talking about, where the toppings are scantily scattered over a thick forest beneath. This place did no such thing. The salad included an ample amount of almonds, blue cheese, and strawberries. In fact, they could've added too many strawberries, or included the ones with yucky bruises or fibrous green stems, but instead they included just enough perfectly cut red treasures to conserve appreciation for each bite that included one. The Atlantic salmon filet on top was crispy and cooked medium rare. Phenomenal salad. No wonder it cost $18! For context, in Columbia, SC, an $18 salad is exorbitant.",

   "Awesome place. Must check it out. Order your sandwich and then choose the sauce. Be ready! You\u2019ll need a nap afterward:)",
   "Extremely disappointed!! So I've dined at this establishment for lunch on a few occasions in the past, with no problems whatsoever! Until recently, when me and a coworker went there for lunch (Thursday). Well, the next day (Friday) when I checked my bank account (I tend to do this on a daily basis with the risk of fraud being so high), I noticed that my card was charged twice for lunch. So basically, I was being charged two payments of $15.75 for lunch. No big deal....I figured the waitress accidentally swiped my card twice without realizing it, because my coworker and I told her that we were paying separately and we both had our own individual bills that we paid with our cards. Well, when I contacted the establishment the next day (Friday), I was told by a young lady that I will receive a refund for the additional amount, and to expect a call from the manager once the refund has been processed. To my surprise, I never received a call from the manager or anyone. So on Monday, I contacted the establishment again and asked to speak to the manager. The manager was the person that actually answered the phone, and when I explained to him what had happened and that I was waiting on his call, of course, the manager didn't have a clue what I was talking about!!! He seemed very friendly and was very apologetic. He told me that he would process my refund immediately, and call me back the minute it was done. NO CALL WAS MADE!!! I called again on Tuesday and left a message for the manager, because he was not there when I called, and here it is on Wednesday, and I still have not heard from the manager or anyone!!! This screams POOR MANAGEMENT!!! The last thing you want your establishment to portray is that you knowingly take STEAL money from your customers, and that you don't even have the decency to reach out and resolve the issue...POOR MANAGEMENT SKILLS!!! I will NEVER eat at Southernbelly BBQ on Harden St. EVER AGAIN!!! My advise to anyone that dines at this establishment, is to pay with cash and if you pay with a debit/credit card, be sure to check your bank account after dining here!!!!"

They give you a circular card one side is green and the other is red. Green means you want food to keep coming to your table and red obviously means stop. I kid you not literally every other minute there was someone coming around with different meats to try. The steaks were delicious. The inside is extremely nice and gives you a luxurious feel to it. It makes you feel important. If you love to eat this is the place for you. I was stuffed within the first 10 minutes. I will be coming back. This time I am prepared. Best place I've eaten at in a long time. Extremely friendly staff as well.",
   "The food was absolutely wonderful. I'm giving this place 4 stars because the customer service could've been a lot better. My server only came to the table twice: To give me my drink, and then to give me my check. I didn't receive a refill on my drink, and she didn't check in to see if everything was okay. It's seems like the only person who was very welcoming and concerned about my stay was the manager. He was warm and hospitable to all the guests. The rest of the employees need to learn about quality customer service.",
   "Stopped by with the wife and kids last night and I must say I had a wonderful experience. Great atmosphere, we had more than our fill and were never left with an empty plate! The manager stopped by to check on our experience and we assured her this will be a frequent stop for our family from now on! 10/10 recommend!",
   "Pretty sure our server was Steve from Stranger Things. Regardless,  he was awesome. The meat! So much meat! Meat coming from every direction. I felt like Piper Perri.The beef rib is a must try. Everything was spectacular.  Left with a serious meat drunk. This place could convert the most devout vegan. When you're in Columbia go get your meat eat on.",
   "Love Love Love, We have all our family celebration dinners here. The wait staff is great. The variety of meats is awesome, the cold salad bar is great. And the hot stuff they have at the bar is always good. They have a bar and have great mix drinks that they prepare at your table. As well as a variety of desserts. The wait to be seated can sometimes be long, especially if they have a promotion going on."

There is nothing in the menu that can\u2019t be enjoyed. Recommend the Salmon Pontchartrain! Filling, tasty and very appetizing. Lo Country Shrimp and Grits is also amazing. Tasty and the grits are out of this world! Deserts are also worth a try if you have the room. They will be a sweet ending to a great night! Give this place a try if you are looking for something new tonight!",

Bread was a hard roll reminding me of a German bakery. No charge for coffee or soft drink. Service good and friendly",

The food was amazing. Flavorful and fulfilling. My only regret is not having another serving of the shrimp and grits. Hands down THE BEST shrimp and grits i've tasted ever!!!. Being a photographer, I definitely made sure I captured a few shots of my dining experience!",
   "The food was good, not great.\nHowever, this is take out and dining in may offer a better dining experience.\nAlso, I didn't order seafood so the potential for the restaurant is high. Will return to dine in when able.",
   "This seafood place normally has rave reviews and is recommended as one of the places to visit in Columbia.  I was disappointed.  We had a fair sized group of 11.  They informed us that they could not seat 11.  They broke us up into 3 groups.  During the entire time they kept multiple tables open in the middle of the restaurant.  As we were leaving they pulled the tables together and sat a party larger than us.  The most disappointing part was that they required a gratuity for a party even though we were broke into 3 groups with separate wait staff.  The food was average at best.  I will give them credit for large amounts of food.  More than I could eat.  I had the firecracker flounder.  The sides of grits and slaw had better flavor than the fish.  The fish was bland and over fried.  It definitely needed the side of salsa for flavor.  The rest of the party at my table had similar experiences."

   "Julia's location is great, as in the decorative sense.  The feeling you get stepping past the doorway is a teleportation to Deutschland!  The Bar area is welcoming and covered with wonderful Bohemian and Bavarian beer!  Nothing to complain on that department.   Now the food... I was not impressed with the food provided at Julia's, but I blame it on the fact that I lived in Germany for 8 years. Now, if you are not familiar with the German cuisine give it a try, you will enjoy this food and all the Bier!",
   "I lived in Germany for many yrs, so I finally decided to try Julia's for the first time. They have a new location, which is a nicer and bigger facility. Plenty of parking all around, easy to find once you come off the interstate. Its locate on the Northeast side of town in Columbia, SC.  It was recommended by a few people that I work and some locals.\n\nThey have a full bar and lots of seating inside, very welcoming place. I did a to go order and waited at the bar. They give you a free complimentary drink while you wait on your order. They were very busy the night I went. They give you huge servings that two people can share. The jager schnitzel was flat, dry, and burnt, gravy didn't have much of a flavor. The salad was good with the red beets. I really wanted to enjoy this place, maybe I will try again and have a different dish. It could be the chef was having a off day. \n\nI would recommend that everyone at least try once, especially if you have never had the German foodie experience. It just didn't do it for me.",
   "We LOVED this place. My son served a church mission in Germany and loves the food so it was fun to eat the authentic stuff. One cool thing that happened while we were there is that because my son was dressed in his blues, a stranger paid for our dinner. Wow!"

When I go to visit the home now I will definitely come to visit this place for their delicious food!!!!!!",

I have been vegan/plant based, for roughly 2 months, I lost count and I wanted to return for another order and I wasn't even 25% finished with this order. \n\nCongratulations on your restaurant and it's amazing success, so far. The restaurant business is no joke, let alone bringing something so uniquely different to the area.",
   "The Mac n Cheese is really good but the bacon cheese burger was pretty disappointing, it's a huge patty but it's dry and falls apart easily, it also tastes more like sausage. The vegan bacon is disturbingly chewy, would not recommend it, but I'll definitely go back to try their other stuff tho.",
   "The \"chicken\" sandwich was amazing. The macaroni and cheese is pretty good too. My first time having vegan macaroni but I would eat it again. It's a little pricey but no more so than if you went to texas roadhouse or smashburger. It's good food and well worth the money."

My wife and I ordered two appetizers and main dishes, and shared everything. I wish we could have tried the dessert, but we were too full.\n\nHighly recommend you visit for something tasty.",
   "Hands down one of the best restaurants in Columbia. Even if you haven't tried Korean food you will love this place. I have been visiting Columbia for almost two weeks now and I have eaten at this restaurant at least five times if not more. The first night I ordered delivery on bitesquad. Everything came packed separate and was piping hot. Since then I've gone in for lunch and dinner trying different dishes and everything is utterly fantastic. They also have a small but well-stocked bar and plenty of beer selections as well. Don't miss this place it's a gem."

   "I decided to try it for the first time. I liked it. I love how all of the beverages come in factory sealed packaging. Eliminates the issue of having flat beverages. The food was prepared quickly, yet accurately. I had the pastrami on pumpernickel. The dessert selection was pretty unique. I ordered a slice of Coconut Cake. I may return in the future.",
   "This place was amazing. Great food, atmosphere and great service. The server told us about all kinds of different sandwiches the way she likes them. Was very informative. Tomato bisque was awesome and the cheescake was the best I have had in a while.",
   "This place is really good! The prices are a little high but the quality of food is great. Only reason I rated them a 4 instead of 5 star is because the chicken on my husband's sandwich was very dry. Tasted a little bland but we let our server know and she apologized asking if we wanted to speak to a manager. But we just wanted her to let the kitchen know. It tasted like they precooked then cooked it again to warm it up. I was happy with my sandwich. I got the croissant breakfast sandwich, which my husband was drooling over! We will definitely be back to try something new!",
   "Always charming & delicious! A great place to meet up for business, lunch date, girlfriend's outing, or takeout. Terrific menu selection, everything always tastes fresh, and the staff is super nice. Try and get there before noon. Lunch is usually packed. But if you can't, it's still worth the wait. Remember, they're only open for lunch.",
   "Their pita chips are to die for.  The service was friendly and fast even during a busy time of the day.  I got their Cobb salad which was delicious.  The bacon crumbles were fresh and think.  Would come here again."

   "I love Lizard Thicket's. The atmosphere of the restaurant is that of a warm and caring family, I've been coming to the restaurant for about 10 years, I came up from Florida in 2010 and what of my pastors and his family took me there for my first time, and since then, that's how I've always been treated at Lizard Thicket's. Also, food is very good, for country cooking it's really spot-on and the cleanliness of the restaurant is more than impressive. And I'll end with this the restrooms always clean. So with all that said, I will keep coming back to Lizard Thicket's for as long as I'm alive.",
   "Always a welcoming location. Drive-thru is usually busy in the mornings, but always a table available inside. Meal is quickly made so my time inside is short. The service is quick and friendly, so that I don't have to wait a long time to eat in the morning. Love the Liver Pudding.",
   "Great location and atmosphere. Our service was great,but the chicken sandwich was not cooked to taste. The fried chicken breast was not cooked to taste . They both were under and over cook. I didn't expect your chicken sandwich to be just a hunk of grilled  breast meat (filet) or (Pull)or a chicken tender style and it didn't come with a side. See this was our 1st time. We got our sweet tea to go which by the way was very good tea also to go boxes for our chicken that would we recook some and season it  our way at home after all it was to much chicken to be thrown away if it was prepared right.",
   "There were lots of items to choose from on the menu. I opted for a dinner plate with a meat and two vegetables. It was delicious! My whole family enjoyed the food. The service was very good. There was a calm, quiet vibe in the restaurant and I liked that, too.",
   "I'm from PA and I was in south Carolina couple of years ago and my family and I stopped for dinner. The food was so amazing and fresh.  I so would drive the 12 hours just for lizards Thicket. I wish they would build one here in PA.."

   "Every time someone offers up a suggestion of Tazza for brunch or dinner I emphatically say or think....\"YES!\". For a, smaller regional, chain they go out of their way to specialize and individualize themselves to feel like they're only a local Columbia restaurant (granted they are the only location in SC). I have honestly never had reason to complain about a single meal from any angle: food quality, drinks (great cocktails!), and service they do a wonderful job. It is tough to recommend only one or two things but I would absolutey suggest the spicy sausage and black pepper honey pizza and the cheeseburger (dijonnaise is incredible).",
   "What a fantastic little restaurant. The ambiance is very nice and the service is great. I had the spicy Italian sausage and peppered honey pizza two days in a row... it's that tasty!  The butternut squash soup is also really good. I will definitely return next time I'm in town.",
   "The food was fresh and had great flavor. I ordered the brisket tacos and they were delicious.  My husband and daughter ordered their own wood fired pizzas so I snuck a bite of each.  They were amazing, and the presentation was perfect.  The server was very attentive and accommodating to our requests.  I highly recommend this restaurant, and we will be returning again.",
   "Fantastic food. Went for brunch about 10 min after they opened and place was already packed so that's a great sign. Super friendly and fast service. Had to wait over 30 min for food but it's so worth it because you can for sure taste how fresh everything is. Drinks not the greatest but the food makes up for it. Prices are a little high but you get what you pay for. Cant wait to go back!",
   "Great service, atmosphere, and cocktails. However, the food left much to be desired. Ordered the cast iron goat cheese (amazing!), a pizza, and my significant other ordered a pasta dish (can\u2019t remember exactly what it was). Overall, the food was just okay. The pizza was a bit burnt, which I normally don\u2019t mind, but it was lacking flavor which exacerbated the taste of the burnt crust. The pasta was just okay, did not taste authentic or of restaurant quality. I would definitely like to give Tazza another try since everyone I know absolutely raves about this place, but maybe try some other items on the menu."

For a main I had The bronzed Atlantic Salmon which was delicious. The service was fantastic. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, very attentive to our table, and very friendly. Interior of the dinning area is very well laid out and makes for a very welcoming environment. Would love to eat here again.",

Keep up the great work guys! \ud83d\udc4d",

Thank you Will for showing me what you have to offer, where to go to order and for being over all helpful and nice.  The salad bar is great, everything is fresh and crisp! I also had the Irish potato soup, wow! I wish we had a Jason's Deli in Orangeburg!!!",
   "My brother and his wife had bragged on the Jason's Deli in Athens, GA for a while, so when we met up in Columbia, SC, they recommended lunch there. My only problem was finding parking close enough for my feeble self to be able to walk in with my walker rather than have to have help with a wheelchair. But with it's downtown location, mostly metered parking and my lack of knowledge of the area, I think we managed fairly well. Upon walking in we were greeted by genuinely very friendly staff members. They explained the menu, made some recommendations, and I still wanted to try everything. So many sandwiches, baked potatoes, soups and combos to shower from! Although I had planned on the wonderful salad bar I had heard so much about, I went with half a grilled veggie sandwich, fruit, and cup of seasonal lobster chowder (so good). My mom chose a half club sandwich with chips and a cup of broccoli cheese soup. They had so many good soups on the menu it was difficult to choose one. I'm still thinking about the descriptions of the Irish potato soup and the chicken chili and wishing I could get back there to try them. By the way, complimentary soft serve ice cream is included with the salad bar. How cool is that? Their pastry/dessert selection looked amazing, but we didn't splurge at the time. Great lunch spot, I highly recommend giving them a try.",
   "Under new management. Really appreciate the new manager taking the time to come face to face with the customers to make a better name for this location. Some of the food on the salad bar needed to be refilled, but we were there during the lunch hour. The cashier was not the friendliest and seemed like she wasn\u2019t thrilled to be at work. Will definitely come back again as Jason\u2019s is one of our go to spots.",
   "Large deli with fresh food. Dine in or carry out makes it very convenient. Good food, large portions, and low prices.",
   "Best lunch in town with a trip to the very fresh salad bar and sandwich  (I got it without bread).  Less than  $8.  And you get dessert!"

I was skeptical of the lemon vinegarette dressing but it was surprisingly delicious.  I'm not a huge lemon fan but this dressing is a must try.  I can't remember what my husband are (pictured) but he loved it.  The inside is decorated with walls full of books.  Gives you sense that you're in a library. Bathrooms were clean.  Outside area with high top tables for sitting around and watching the games with friends.",
   "TRASH. Im so embarrassed to say that I helped open this place many years ago. It takes an act of extreme ignorance or neglect for a pizza to turn into soup. Thanks for wasting our lunch",
   "From service to atmosphere to food,  this charming establishment gets all high marks . I visited Columbia, with my dog, to take my college student to lunch. She suggested Thirsty Fellow, based on a prior visit and that they are dog friendly.  The outdoor seating area was covered,  super clean and had heaters. It was a windy, chilly day so that was a plus! The server was attentive and the burgers we ordered were BIG!  I have paid more for much less filling lunches.  This was definitely a great dining experience that we want to repeat.",
   "Went for lunch and had several of their special items. Food was good but service was lacking and the food took along time to come out. We did have a table of 8 people so I'm sure that contributed but still they weren't packed and the food wasn't anything that should have taken 30 min to prepare. Overall experience was good. We enjoyed our meal and I would go back."

We got the Cuban with Coleslaw, the Crab & Artichoke dip w/ pita, the Asian Salad w/ Salmon, Med-Hot Wings, & the Quesadilla w/ chicken. All of the food was very flavorful. The portions are a good size. The building was easy to find and the interior decor was very modern, clean and stylish. I can't wait to go back and eat inside! PS - They enclosed a hand written note in the Togo order thanking us for supporting local business! Very nice touch!",
   "Nice atmosphere - more of a bar. Would be good on game day to watch your favorite team. Wings were not great (Public House still has best ones). Will try burger next time - it is the litmus test for Columbia ;)",
   "Very good food, excellent service, good drinks. Nice varied menu. I had the Reuben and potato cake. Karen had the Southwest club and truffle fries (they're a little extra, but consider them) They were very accommodating in substituting the pepper jack (a little too much, we thought, with the spicy sauce). The Reuben was perfect, including a perfect crust on the bread and good balance -- not overwhelmed with kraut or thousand island. Loved the tomato parmesan soup, and Karen said it was some of the best French onion she's had. I wasn't overwhelmed by salt the way too many are and had a generous cheese crust. The potato cake was a little under seasoned, but just needed a quick shake of table salt. Backstreets is in the old Dianne's on Devine. We'll be back when we're in the neighborhood.",
   "Awesome Reuben and loved the sweet potatoes also. Great lunch and service was excellent.",
   "Looking forward to coming back here. A friend and I decided to give this a try and we were not disappointed! My friend had a salad with grilled chicken, mandarin oranges\u2019 and I am not sure what else. She ate it all! It was very popular that day. I got their Cuban sandwich. I\u2019ve never tried one before and it did not disappoint. I loved it! They\u2019ve got a great selection of tap beer also. Not sure common run-of-the-mill Budweiser or Miller light either. I had a Sierra Nevada But I can\u2019t tell you which one. It was perfect with the sandwich."

The wine selection is deep and supportive of the exceptional menu. Portions are generous and flavorful with absolutely perfect ingredients. Every phase of this experience was satisfying and rewarding. Highly recommend! 5 Giant stars!",

   "Amazing romantic setting! It\u2019s upstairs (hence the name) and offers a great view of Downtown Columbia! We had the fried oysters and crab cakes for an appetizer and they were top notch. The service was exceptional and the server was attentive without being intrusive. It is definitely an adult only restaurant. The price was appropriate for the food and setting offered.",
   "Al\u2019s Upstairs is by far one of favorite restaurants in Downtown Columbia. Our host/hostess is always highly professional and courteous. And the food? The food is always amazing. Our favorite are the crab cakes appetizer followed by the Pasta Alla Al entr\u00e9e. Try to request a window seat while making your reservation to take advantage of the Downtown Columbia city views.",

After talking to Al and explaining how much our son liked the restaurant, he was able to accommodate our party of 3. We had a wonderful dinner. The food was great; Pasta a la Al - amazing, Veal chop - perfect, Chicken Charleston - great. They had our favorite Italian wine, Amarone. The service was also outstanding. I wish I could give them 6 stars."

Husband had flounder which was in a sauce and he said it was delicious but for all entrees on the day we went you had to order sides additionally except for the steak. We had a macaroni and lamb appetizer dish which was very very good. Desserts wonderful. The ambience is nice and a big beautiful bar area. Terra is located in a very old (about 100 years?) Building in a row of original buildings in West Columbia and feels like an \"extension\" of the Columbia Vista. Highly recommend Terra but, ok it's pricey but it's worth it. Lovely courtyard area available for private parties.",

The wine list, beer selections and, cocktails are varied, eclectic and a little unique. Finding a wine pairing for your meal won't be a problem!  The staff are engaging, attentive and professional without being hard to talk with.  Questions about the menu didn't require a trip to the kitchen as our waitress knew menu and made great suggestions.",
   "very small restaurant with a good seasonal menu. our server was pleasant. large wine menu! I wasnt a fan of my entree but everything else including my dates dinner was tasty!",
   "Busy on a Monday for lunch was a great first impression! Really cool little spot in Columbia featuring comfort food of The South. Great menu selection with beer wine and cocktails and friendly and prompt service. I will definitely return when I'm back in the city.",
   "Food was great,  except for the grilled green tomatoes.  They were too salty. The portion sizes were small for the cost of the food.  The waitress was pleasant and friendly. Nice ambiance and beautiful artwork.",
   "Awesome restaurant! Service was exceptional, presentation was on point, food was delicious! We stopped here cause they buy local and it didn't disappoint. Would highly recommend this establishment."

   "Me and my boyfriend visited this location the day after Valentine\u2019s Day for a belated celebration. This place is amazing!! So comfortable, romantic, fun experience. The food was so good and the drinks were fantastic. The only reason for 3 stars is our waiter was run ragged. He explained how they were short staffed that night and to bare with him which is completely understandable. Every single time he came to our table he was sweating and out of breath, obviously stressed.\n\nOur reservation was at 9:30, we were sat by 9:40. We didn\u2019t leave till 12:40. Which we didn\u2019t notice since we were on a much needed date and our waiter even gave us a free bottle of wine for the inconvenience. He was so informative and helpful. But please, hire more people or you will for sure lose the good quality ones!!!",
   "This is the best place to take out a date or to take spouse out for a dinning experience sure to impress,  the table/booths are very private and intimate you wont have to worry about the people at other tables staring at you while you dine. Be ready to sit and enjoy dinner for at least 2 or more hours because you will be cooking most of your food at table in different cooking styles from grilling to a boiling hot broth dip , the food is of the highest quality",
   "Very nice restaurant, a welcomed change from the norm. The restaurant itself was nice and our server, John, was absolutely amazing! He was passionate about his job it it showed! The prices were a little higher than expected, but I would definitely recommend that you give this place a try at least once!",
   "That place it's always fun to eat at. It is a pricey but delicious. Make sure you bring your appetite with you!!! Jason was a very attentive server and did a great job!",
   "I absolutely love The Melting Pot with my entire heart! An amazing and intimate atmosphere. We had a great waitress! Can't remember her name but she had green hair and was so down to earth and kind."

   "It's safe to say that Columbia is full of hidden treasure that could not be discovered unless someone else told you about it. Asanka Kitchen is at the top of that list and will continue to grow in popularity due to its delicious food and wonder customer service. Very welcoming friendly atmosphere filled with generous portions of food, served with a smile. I will be returning."

   "Duck was delicious. Bread and stuffed peppers were also. Excellent",
   "Ristorante Divino is expensive Italian restaurant downtown.  The main dishes hit well and they have a extra helping of flavor. The scallops were seared perfectly and the risotto had a unique and interesting flavor. The pappardelle was flavorful and smooth and the sauce was well matched for a wide pasta.  The appetizers were also good especially the calamari, which I would claim was the best I've had in Columbia.  However, Divino faulters as a fine dining experience in Columbia in part due to it's outdated decor, its inexperienced staff, and a dessert, which was honestly . . . terrible.  The tiramisu was dry, lacked flavor, and should just be taken off the menu.  After quite a good meal putting that on the table left us quite literally with a bad taste in our mouth as we walked out the door.",

   "Very tasty authentic Italian dishes. Cozy atmosphere, very friendly and attentive service.",
   "The dining experience here was amazing. As soon as you walked in the atmosphere changed. All employees were dressed formally and spoke to you with respect.\n\nThe service was average, except for the waitress who treated my mother poorly because she ordered a soup and a salad instead of something expensive.\n\nI had the Paparadelle Bolognese. It was outstanding. The seasoning was just the right amount and I wasn't overloaded with the potatoes. I certainly received what I paid for."

Better than a few places I've been to. The food was excellent, the staff were friendly , polite and helpful. The view was beautiful. Took a bit to get use to the revolving . I will be back!!!! Best brunch and priced reasonable. Thank you for a great experience . Students can use a meal plan here just need to pay the difference.",

   "The view is nice. Unfortunately, the food is sub par. Food was lukewarm. Salmon was fishy a d the pasta was too salty. The salad with the orange vinaigrette was great. My wife was eating off of the \"vegan\" menu, but they brought her a salad covered in goat cheese that we had to send back, then on desert they brought her chocolate covered strawberries and a pound cake with cream that we also had to send back. I was \"aware\" of the price, because I called in and asked, but I was told $80, I overheard someone else in the restaurant be told $70, the bill came out at $77 but was not itemized. I'm not sure if that was $70 plus tax or $70 flat including tax and they up-sold me on the sparkling cider. At this point, I was just irritated, and I was ready to go.",

There was a big selection of food; bbq, fried chicken, fish, salads, vegetables, deserts and ice tea, lemonade and coffee were included. It takes about an hour for a full rotation and we enjoyed the changing scenery. One of my favorite things is it\u2019s casual....jeans, shorts and even baby strollers were there. For the price you can\u2019t go wrong and our granddaughter had a meal she will remember for a long time. The servers couldn\u2019t have been nicer and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed,",

The only downside is finding parking but they can't do anything about that. Salmon was fantastic but has a lot of pepper. Strawberry salad was great too!",

Our contact, Sara Allen, was extraordinarily helpful and had great suggestions on setup, menu, and best use of the available space. We hosted 57 people in the party room and had the bar for happy hour and buffet.  The space was cozy but comfortable.  Chef Bruner's appetizers, buffet and desert totally exceeded our expectations.  Buffets tend to dry out; not ours--everything was hot, fresh and tender. They supported us with a huge staff of cheerful, enthusiastic servers; I think some were students of the USC School of Hospitality. They get top marks.  All-in--all, this was the best choice we could have made.  Sorry, I ran out of stars, this place is the best.",

They even accommodated out request to leave off the roasted tomatoes and add more buratta - grazie!",

The wait was a little long, make a reservation on Fri or Sat. Tons of wine in all price ranges. Excellent service. The total package.",

The only thing that saddens me about our experience was the table next to us. There was about 5 children who left a huge mess under the table.

It was our first time here, and she helped with our menu selections.  \nHubby had the Bolognese and enjoyed it very much.\nI had the Veal Marsala and it was divine.  For a nominal charge, they allowed me to substitute a side for the pasta, which I was happy about.\nTiramisu was our dessert choice and yummy - so large it is a must to share!\nKitchen has an open view so you can see the busy staff preparing the dishes.  \nWe definitely enjoyed our dining experience here and would return when we are in the Columbia area."

They can are happy to make anything you ask for. In my decades of experience eating here - Any roll or Japanese food eaten at any other restaurant, they are happy to make for me at my request. Cost-wise, they are comparable to prices paid elsewhere. However, Freshness is their selling point.\n\nThe clientele is mostly ex-military, military and an abundance of locals who love Sushi! They open at 5pm for dinner but get crowded early on but leave within 45 minutes. For best seating arrive at opening or well after 6:30pm.\n\nOh, they are open for lunch and frequently have Lunch specials - be sure to ask about them!"

   "This place has great food and I have been many times.  However, I don\u2019t plan on going back after my last experience.  A group of friends had a table for 8 with a 5:30 reservation.  Some of the group trickled in closer to 6PM but someone arrived at the restaurant at 5:30 to claim the reservation.  Obviously with a larger group it takes more time for the entire dining experience than it would for a table for 2 or 4 people.  After 2 hours Monica, the owner, came over to our table and basically told us we needed to go to the bar or leave because she had the table reserved for someone else.  While I consider myself to be an understanding person, the way she handled it and her attitude was a complete turn off.  She wasn\u2019t very pleasant and made us feel like we had to rush to finish our half full glasses of wine after ordering a bottle of wine.  She was not friendly or seemed appreciative of the business we had done at her restaurant.  George, her husband/co-owner, came over after she did and told us thank you and asked if we enjoyed the meal...how customer service should be!  With understanding this being a smaller space, it was never mentioned that there was a time limit when the reservation was made via the telephone.  In fact, my friend originally tried to make a reservation for 10 and Monica said we can\u2019t accommodate 10 people in a short tone.  My friend\u2019s response was \u201cWell, I guess we won\u2019t be eating at your restaurant will we?\u201d.   I am extremely disappointed as there is no other place like iL Giorgione in Columbia.  Too bad...",
   "One of our favorite places to go for authentic Italian food!! They make their own mozzarella in house and it is amazing!! Love, love their Spaghetti Carbonara as it's as close to authentic that I've found!",
   "Great service, awesome drink menu, really tasty food, and good prices....they have it all. I'll definitely be back.",
   "Staff, atmosphere, and food were amazing! Can\"t wait to go back.",
   "I arrive at this unique restaurant often since I like the ambiance that is characterizes this restaurant. The staff is exceptionally friendly and professional. The service is exceptionally efficient. Needless to say, the food you eat is excellent. I ate there more than once and I was always happy. The expense is decent. I suggest this place to all my friends."

   "I can definitely say this place has a great/fun atmosphere, just my opinion on this but the tacos are just weird, BBQ tacos? I mean come on.... that\u2019s like something you create in your kitchen when you\u2019re hammered, on a positive note the guacamole is exceptional. I highly recommend ordering that! Another note the bartenders are great! As a former bartender myself I can certainly say that these guys know how to make drinks! Very good guys!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

   "On Cinco de Mayo my wife and I decided to go to go here to get take out. We come here regularly and usually have had decent experiences. We waited in line for 20 minutes to order and then another hour for food, which was as to be expected due to covid and the Cinco de Mayo crowd. \n\nMy wife and I ordered 8 tacos. The girl taking our order wrote it all down correctly, read back to me what I read to her. She placed the order and brought me back a non-itemized receipt, which made sense cost-wise. \n\nWhen they brought the food to us, they read our order to me which was missing 2 tacos. We told them that we were missing those tacos, and a girl went to check on it for us. Five minutes later, a different employee came out with a $7.70 bill saying if we wanted them that we would have to pay. I told him that I already ordered the tacos and paid, but that my tacos simply weren\u2019t in the bag. He went back to check on them for me. The employee then returned another five minutes later with the original receipt which was all balled up, like it was in the trash, and he went through the bill with me to prove that they were right and that I owed them the money for the tacos. \n\nI begrudgingly paid the extra, and he then placed the order for me, which came out 15 minutes after that point (which was 25 minutes after the original bag of food we already waited an hour for). By this time our original tacos were cold. \n\nIn addition, when we went in the car to eat the tacos, some of the tacos had cheese on them, which we ordered them without cheese due to my wife\u2019s dairy allergy. \n\nThe poor customer service that I received yesterday is why I will never return to Cantina 76 and I will stop recommending it to colleagues and friends. I hope it was worth the $7.70."

   "We found out about this place from our tour guide at USC. He mentioned it was featured on Dives, Diners, and Drive Ins, so we knew we had to check it out. Honestly, I thought it was a liquor store at first because of all of the decorations in the window, but as we walked to the door, we realized it wasn't. The inside was fun and the waitress was extremely friendly with quick service. They're known for their burgers, so some of us tried to that and they were HUGE. They were absolutely delicious and well worth the money!",
   "Good main dishes, but the service... I know it was busy when we came in but it tapered off long before we left. Never got drink refills, finally got our extra side of honey mustard as we left (which we ordered with our meal,) and spent 2/3 of our time in the restaurant AFTER finishing eating. This was our second time coming and second time with sluggish service. Our server was super nice, just... very slow. Happy to say the fries were excellent this time. Highly recommend the pimento cheese and fried green tomato BLT- it was off the charts! Giving 3\u2606 instead of 4 because I feel like service is hit or miss... and we just keep missing it.",
   "These burgers and fries were absolutely phenomenal! Service was great as well. I will be back soon to try more items on the menu. In my photo is the Wadmalaw burger on a pretzel bun",
   "Best Sweet Potato Fries EVER ! Burger was good,  the Fried Green Tomato BLT was excellent,  what a concept to add Fried Green Tomato and Pimento Cheese.  Completely different than other sandwiches.  Wife loved her buttermilk chicken wrap also. We ate there at lunch so it wasn't busy yet. We had great service and quick,  hot food."

   "Great burgers and fries - Greek salad was surprisingly excellent. Usually good burger places don't have good salad but this place beats their competitors nearby on this item. Furniture is basic but good and beer selection are very good.",
   "We were looking for a bite to eat for lunch when we happened upon this place.  Our server was Hilary, and she was so nice!  She sat us at the table our 4 year old chose, and was quick to get us beverages.  She was readily available when we needed to order our food.  The kids menu was perfect, and I was able to get a favorite, fried pickles!  I got a burger called the \"Mess\".  It was a burger patty with a fried egg, and chili.  Nomnom.  The kiddo got a corn dog and fries with a lemonade.  They had a large menu, and lots of beer choices.  The room was large for plenty of seats, and they had an outside patio as well.  I will return to this establishment again soon!",
   "They have the vittles! Outstanding brunch and beverages. My first time there, while visiting my pops for an early Father's Day weekend. Since it was my first time at the bar restaurant, I had to order the \"Chonga\"--stellar breakfast burrito with eggs and various meats, with a side of fruit and hashbrown casserole. I took half to go. Our server-bar tender, Alyssa, was outstanding--very professional (giving great recommendations) and friendly. You could tell she has experience working there--kind of runs that place but not in an overbearing style. Probably is fun to work for/with. Regarding the stellar food, apparently the head chef (Henry?) gets there at 5 AM to make the magic happen. Well done, good sir.",
   "The Divine St location is great.  The location, atmosphere, food, and service are all awesome.  Go out there, grab a beer and a burger and enjoy yourself.",

   "We enjoyed a wonderful (takeout) meal from Harambe. I had been meaning to try the restaurant since moving to Columbia and I am so glad I did. The vegetable sampler and Harambe sampler are both fantastic. I can\u2019t wait to order again and to eat in soon!",

   "My husband and I went at a quiet time, around 2. We were welcomed and given menus. Everything on their menu sounds good but I decided to try the chicken tibs and beef tibs. My husband had the meat platter. The flavors were amazing!!!! Lovely and cozy atmosphere. There is a bar and it looks like they may have a lively happy hour but we were able to enjoy our food and quiet.",

   "Fantastic experience with this place during restaurant week! I got the rib plate (should say riblets as it advertises itself as a full rack of ribs when it's a half rack (?)) with mashed potatoes and gravy as well as mac and cheese. Ribs were tasty and the moonshine sauce was really good, though I wish it had more \"moonshine\" flavor and was a little less sweet. Mac and cheese was the standout. Unique and savory, with some bell pepper to give it a twist. Mashed potatoes were maybe a little on the heavy side, but flavor was fabulous. Friend got the London broil with the horseradish sauce (which was perfect) and the flank steak was spot on. Very good experience. I'll be returning.",
   "Went for brunch on a Saturday. No wait. Pleasant customer service. Pictured is the fish and grits, hash brown casserole and chicken and waffles. The fish was well seasoned. The grits were just OK. I'm a southern girl who knows grits. The chicken and waffles were average per the hubby. I didn't taste the hash browns. The fish and grits were quite filling!",
   "Ordered takeout through Bitesquad - ordered chili cheese fries and was given fries with cheese on top. No chili, no black beans. Ordered a taco salad and was given the most pitiful pile of iceberg lettuce with avocado and mushy chicken on top. I was so excited to be having a good meal and was left highly disappointed. In a time where takeout is KEY, take more pride in what you\u2019re doing.",
   "We have been going here since they opened  40 years ago. It's also a favorite if we have out of town family or friends visiting as the menu has something for everyone. My husband loves the Confederate fried steak with gravy while I usually go with shrimp tacos or a vegetable plate. The hot fudge sundae is to die for and easily feeds two. Here's to another 40 years!!!!! PS: And their  servers ROCK!",

A juicy perfectly cooked blackened Swordfish.  The Huntsman crafted by Boone was a beautifully concocted bourbon cocktail with a smokey campfire salted rim.  I feel I could eat here every night!",
   "Did not really know what to expect when walking in, but as soon as you get to the top of the stairwell you get a vibe of elegance and fine dining. Was a bit shocked at the menu prices, however everything prepared is locally sourced and was downright delicious! Is it a good place to go with your buddies to grab a cheap meal? No, but one shouldn't come to expect that of this restaurant. I went here for date night and it was a spectacular evening. The service was some of the best in Columbia, and the food not only was plated beautifully, but tasted wonderful as well.",
   "Outstanding service from Alyssa! (Hope I spelled that right) she was beyond helpful and constantly smiling. Highly recommend the winter vegetable salad (top photo), fried oysters, pork tacos, crispy fried Brussels spirit leaves (and I hate Brussels sprouts). Classy yet trendy ambience. Didn\u2019t get to check out the rooftop bar because of timing in my end, but definitely will be next time.",
   "Hendrix is such a great place.  It's very cozy and very nicely set up.  The menu is delicious and so are the cocktails. My date and I stuck with the tapas menu and got the gnocchi, carnitas tacos, pork belly,  and the flash fried oysters.  All dishes were very tasty.  The shining star were the gnocchi.  OMG they were so good!  Definitely get 'em. The rooftop is also very cool.",
   "Love the food, atmosphere and service! It is a great place for date night and love the character of the location! We will be back to enjoy! The flash fried brussel sprouts are incredible and I do not like  Brussels but could eat these all night!"

Along with the chicken I put a little  of the spicy dressing on it. Turns out the chicken was really good without the dressing but was even better with. \n\nOnly down side was the lack of some sort of bread. Since this was over $10 for it, that would have made it perfect.  I know the Mediterranean area is full of bread items, throw them in!\n\nStill can highly recommend everything!",

I wanted a side of mayo for my fries and I had to remind her after 5-10 minutes that i was waiting for it. I also asked for extra chicken in my chicken wrap and didn't get it and I asked for an extra portion of gyros for my takeout gyros platter and didn't get that either. I wasn't charged for them, so I didn't lose out.  I will be back again though as this spot is close to work and the food is always tasty.",

   "Great place for food and drinks. Yummy food at fair prices. Excellent and knowledgeable staff. Wonderful beer menu and whiskey selection. Sparse cocktail menu, but quality ingredients. Dry rub wings are incredible if that\u2019s your thing.",
   "Good beer and food. Prices are OK. Service was very poor. Not a lot of people at the place yet it took forever for a few plates in our table. Some of us finished our food before others were served. Two people on my table received their plate and not their side. Received the side after finished they finished their food. Manager came and said sorry and that we were lucky it didn\u2019t take longer. Unfortunately the good food was overshadowed by the poor kitchen service and manager.",
   "Didn't have a reservation for New Year's. We were fitted in within 30 minutes. Disappointed they were out of truffle fries though it looked like people that came after us had them served. Good service."

It was my friends birthday so they gave him a big dish of ice cream with whipped cream... overall, it was wonderful. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Longhorn Steakhouse.",
   "LongHorn lived up to its reputation in Columbia. Good food, good service and great ambiance. It was not very crowded which supported a faster service as they were six in our group. We also observed an even bigger group that also received similar service from the staff. There was a mix up with one of our orders, but management stepped in and quickly fixed the problem.We will be coming back.",
   "This is a very unique longhorn. It's in a very cool historical building. The service was excellent. They accidentally overcooked my son's steak, but took it back and had him a new one in no time. They had very good cocktails. I had the old fashioned and it was amazing. Just an over all very good experience. I would recommend anybody to try this location.",
   "I ordered the Cesar salad with chicken, the lettuce didn't taste very fresh, bitter and the dressing was awful, too thick. The smokehouse chicken wings were amazing!!! I'd return to order those chicken wings \ud83d\udc4d",
   "Longhorn Steakhouse never disappoints.  One of the Best Steaks!  The Wild West Shrimp and the Strawberry Daiquiri are the Best Around!!"

   "This place is luscious! Reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen. The smell of sweet cinnamon rolls fills the air and you are hit with it immediately upon entering the space. Such a cute and quaint space for a nice breakfast. Had the shrimp and grit bowl which was quite filling and delicious for the price. Loved that they include a mini cinnamon roll with each purchase. Just enough to satisfy my sweet craving! Will definitely be back to try the maple and bacon cinnamon roll \ud83d\ude0b",
   "Great cinnamon roles bar none. What I was not expecting was how good their food was. I have a hot dog and it was pretty much the best I have ever had. Served on a brioche bun and the chips...wow. so very good. Get there early. They get crowded and close early. \n\nEveryone should go here if your passing even remotely close.",
   "Going to Cinnamon roll deli is always a great experience. The sandwiches are delicious and the cinnamon rolls are out of this world. Although parking is limited and there is normally a line, it is worth it and the owner is always trying to make sure that you have a great experience. She brought out waters and chip s while we waited. The food came out fast and there was a lot of it. Definitely recommend to everyone. It\u2019s the first place I mention whenever anyone asks for recommendations in Columbia",
   "Everything is delicious. The food is absolutely worth the wait for  breakfast or lunch. And the owner is amazing, she make sure her customer are enjoying there food. I can\u2019t wait to go back! The cinnamon rolls are not overly sweet they are the perfect Balance! They have something for everyone.",
   "My husband had the Big D sandwich, which he said was absolutely delicious! He also had the Carolina Nachos, which weren't great. They were freshly baked chips topped with cold chili, shredded cheese and sour cream. Would be better warm. I ordered two cinnamon rolls, the Wild Berry & graham cracker was delicious. It was fairly dark and crunchy around the edges, but still good. I also got the Black Pepper Maple Bacon cinnamon roll. The menu says this one was featured on the Food Network, but I'm not sure why. The roll was good, but it was all sweet and no salty. I could barely taste the pepper and the bacon had no flavor whatsoever. I might return again to try a sandwich, but as others said, parking is awful and it's not worth waiting in line if you go on a weekend."

The service is excellent, staff is friendly, and - I cannot emphasize this enough - the food is incredible. I've had sushi around the world, including several restaurants in Japan, and Camon's is still one of my top favorites!",

Great service dining in, nice outdoor patio seating with water features. Great place but not much parking, as typical in most places downtown.",
   "Amazing food the reason I actually came here is I was driving by and could smell the most amazing smell of bbq chicken! So delicious and so well prepared 5 out of 5 stars hands down! Will be returning!",
   "Just walking by The Pot Smoker will make you hungry. The delicious smokey aroma draws you in. We ordered the redneck nachos and bbq plates. Let me tell you...I am not a huge fan of pork rinds but their nachos use them in place of chips and are piled high with tons of smoked pulled pork, cheese, and bacon. These things can be a meal on their own. Prices are fair, staff is friendly and informative, and the food is excellent. This is definitely a must stop in if you're in Downtown Columbia and love BBQ.",

I ordered  the Captain Platter and it was soo fresh ,hot, delicious and the price was amazingly cheap. I once was a fan of Red Lobster not anymore Golden Bay is my New seafood spot. If you don't believe me go check it out for yourself. You will truly change your mind about going to any other seafood restaurant. I give this place 10 \u2b50 and 10 thumbs up\ud83d\udc4d\u2764",

   "Eating fried sea food; you don't know what to expect... will it all be breading, is there flavor? THIS PLACE IS EXCELLENT!! Light on the breading and packed with great flavor! I followed the waiter's suggestion for adding tossed cracked pepper and salt; it was not overwhelming, but a nice kick to the food. I was too full for dessert, but I will be back... maybe next time. The waiter was very attentive. Thank you for a great dinner."

They had trivia night going and sounded like fun, although we did not participate. We started off with the Oysters Rockafellas. This appetizer is packed with so much flavor they will blow you away! My boyfriend had the Honey Mustard Chicken Salad and I had the Charleston Chicken as entrees. Both entrees were equally delicious along with the sides. Definitely an off the path place to check out.",
   "The cocktails were fantastic, and the service was amazing.  I think at one point we spoke to almost every staff member & they were all very sweet. However, I do feel like the food was a bit expensive for the quality.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, it wasn\u2019t horrible, the portions were adequate, but it wasn\u2019t anything to swoon over, either.  Certain aspects of the meal almost seemed like they were frozen & then heated, rather than cooked fresh.  We generally enjoyed our evening, but I think if we returned it would be for the bar more so than the food.",
   "The crab cakes are excellent!  Fish Fry-Day features fried flounder, shrimp, hush puppies, and french fries and generally sells out, so order early.",
   "We tried the salmon wrap and a burger which was thick and juicy. Both were delicious and the service was good. I will eat here again. Recommend using GPS for location because it's at the back of the building.",
   "Excellent veggie burger! The fries are amazing. Family friendly atmosphere and neat history to the restaurant. Check out the cool bar made from old wooden doors. Mouse Trap is a hidden treasure and has a great menu."

   "Brunch was amazing. Best place to eat on sunday morning",
   "If you're looking for a happy hour special, Bourbon is hard to beat. 4-6 pm, $10 will get you a $4 beer, a shot of Bulleit bourbon, and a burger (no sides). If you want a beer that isn't $4 they charge the difference. And Bourbon burgers are solid. Delicious beef ground in house and cooked to order. Served on warm delicious butter glazed buns with onion, tomato, and Boston bib lettuce, with condiments on the side. Your choice of cheese. The beef is perfectly seasoned so that you can really enjoy the flavor of the beef without it being overwhelmed by a lot of excess toppings.",

When there was another \"the Villa\" in Five Points, they also were known for great flavor.They still have that special touch. We celebrated my wife's birthday here. Yum!",
   "The atmosphere and staff are great, but the food is not! The pizza crust reminds me of something you can get at a gas station, though the toppings were good. When I mentioned it to the staff, I was told that their regulars would revolt if they were to change the crust! Well I say that you should get a new set of regulars, because they have no taste in pizza! Go for the atmosphere, go for the wine, but don't go for the food or you will be disappointed!",

I was surprised to learn that they didn\u2019t have fresh garlic as a pizza topping given that it\u2019s an Italian restaurant. Pizza did not have enough cheese and was heavy on the pizza/tomato sauce. Sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can. I can\u2019t comment on their other items but was disappointed with their pizza."

Can't wait to get the ribs. There is a fine line of wanting someone to be noticed and successful but not so much that it makes it impossible to get your favorites for yourself....lol\nGouda mac n cheese was great also.",

The beef ribs are the only ones of their kind in the Midlands. They combine tender beef, a smoky finish and a peppery bark for a taste of Texas Q in South Carolina. "
