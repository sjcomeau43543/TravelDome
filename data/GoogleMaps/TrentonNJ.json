   "The reason I love this place is because it was the place where Rare Disease Day 2020 was hosted and celebrated. Because of its ideal location in the heart of Trenton, the event was able to have its' very first legislative roundtable where 2 assemblymen and 2 assemblywomen were able to make there way over to the event and interact directly with attendees. The entrance is accessible and the event was held on a Monday morning and surprisingly allowed for easy street parking. The acoustics and lighting were a bit difficult. The windows allowed way too much light into the room where clear pictures were practically impossible to take. If the windows had drapes, it would have allowed for better picture taking but the in person experience was very much enjoyable.",
   "This was well above my expectations. The museum is relatively small compared to some others, but the quality is on par with the really big museum. It is free to get in, free parking on the weekends and the staff there is truly exceptional. I took my kindergartner for the exhibits and Planetarium. She absolutely loved it. It was easily one of the best free activities to spend 4 hours with her.",
   "It\u2019s great for a free little museum. I enjoy taking my kids especially upstairs to see the natural science section and there are puzzles and books upstairs as well. Nice gift shop and we have enjoyed the planetarium a few times (not free). Parking is the only problem\u2014if you park in the garage, be prepared to have to ask to be let back in as the door locks behind you. And the people are always grumpy to open it for you.",
   "I love this museum! Its free and its a great place to go with kids or on your own. There's always something to learn! The staff is friendly and great with kids. Every exhibit is fascinating. The second floor has a kids area where they can learn through play. We haven't done a planetarium show yet but we hope to soon!",
   "It's the kind of Museum you would expect from a small City. The exhibits were marginally interesting with the sole exception of the art gallery which had a wide array of interesting paintings ranging from the 19th century to contemporary art. It's the kind of Museum that I would have said that it's an Hidden Gem if it would have been in the middle of nowhere. However, this is New Jersey's State Museum, and they could have done a much better job."

Very fun premise to \"step back in time\" and act as though it were the 1770s, as well as the idea to involve the kids as much as possible. Everything was also handicap accessible, which was a huge worry (although it is a tight squeeze in the halls and elevator!) \nMy favorite part was getting to watch them fire a musket blank.",

   "Always enjoy this museum. Interesting local exhibits and special shows. Nice gift shop.",
   "I went there for the first time and felt like a safe space. The grounds were well kept. This park was designed for family gatherings and joyous celebrations.\nI would recommend this park for meditation only if you have extreme focus- I'm talking Yoda, Master Splinter, Grand Lotus, etc. Otherwise, you need to go explore a quieter area of the park with less distractions.\nThe reason I gave it three stars is because the roads need to be clearly marked for EXIT. There were motorists going top speed the opposite way down the one way streets."

   "Great statue but the interior museum is closed to the public because the elevator is over 100 years old and unsafe. Would cost a fortune to repair and the city of Trenton is strapped for cash. The granite monument is beautiful and worth a visit during the day or during a special event. It's not terribly safe for tourists at nighttime.",
   "Not as scary as place as it was a decade ago. A beautiful sight and monument so inspiring. A must see location in American history. It started here.",
   "On location for the ribbon cutting of the \"Wellness Loop\"",
   "This is a beautiful monument and the only thing I could find in Trenton remotely related to one of the most important battles of the American Revolution. Sadly, it is somewhat dilapidated and the park around it is not well kept at all. The general surrounding neighborhood seemed fairly sketchy as well. So, if you are in Trenton, go by and see this, but don't hang out there too long."

Go, enjoy, relax, get inspired by artsy ideas, bring a friend, enjoy a cup of tea or lunch in their cafe. It's great to visit in anytime except winter.",

The works and their attention to detail are amazing. I highly recommend this collection if you've never been. I'd love to come back in warmer weather to see even more.",

   "really nice place to visit. Great online ticket prices although sometimes not working (good service will get you the deal during the visit). Sculptures are great! A lot to see. Pity you cannot bring dog, but makes sense as it would be mess",
   "It is a very fun place to walk around in, but there are no paper maps for visitors or large maps other than in the main building, said a worker. He told me I would have to walk back to the first building and take a picture of the map. I would have appreciated being warned by the check-in workers when I got my wristband or preferred that there at least be a map in every large building.\n\nAnyway, the peacocks are fun to spot, the grounds are beautiful, and the sculptures are numerous. They rotate in new sculptures, so there is something new to see every year. The Awakening giant remains one of my favorites to wander about."

   "Washington Crossing has a variety of backdrops between historic houses and nature. It is particularly beautiful in the spring time when the trees begin flowering. If you go at the right time, its not crowded either. Overall, it\u2019s a great place for family and maternity photo shoots.",
   "Worth the trip to understand just how close we came to not being a nation. You will have a new appreciation for those that fought for their country.\nAside from the history, it's a very scenic area.",
   "Easy parking, nice visitor center. Numerous things to see as you walked about. Fairly close to restaurants and little towns.",
   "The park is great. However I called first to make sure the tower was open on March 1st and was told that it was. I then drove 90 minutes from Reading to find out that it was in fact NOT open! Get your act together people!",
   "Beautiful state park picnic area the rivers right there and Jersey is a hop and skip away nice place to relax and and enjoy beautiful homes near by a lot to explore"

We would highly recommend going to the Amazing Escape Room in Princeton and anyone who gets Jason as their game master is in for such a fun time!",

Staff was nice and helpful and we'd love to go back and try again.  No pictures allowed in the rooms, so I'm only able to post one of the area where they take your picture when you're done.",

Loved the guidelines/rules provided (folks can leave the room and the game still continues - no disqualification!) and the staff was very welcoming and engaging.  It's amazing how fast 60 minutes flies by!  Will, for sure, do this again!",
   "We had a wonderful time as a birthday gift  in the Pawn shop robbery experience. Arthur was a terrific host. We were 5in late but we're able to solve 5 out of 7 puzzles. Feeling proud. This was our second time. We enjoyed this one more than the great train heist!",
   "Helpful staff and a fun experience! The clues in the room tested our wits. The staff is able to keep an eye on us in the room and offer clues and entertainment with their sense of humor.  Could make for a great team- building activity. Can be hard to find this place as you drive or after you park."

Inside of temple is made from all marble with incredible intricate designs. They have done an incredible job carving and constructing America's largest Hindu temple. The food court (cafeteria) is amazing, they have a very large variety of great foods at a cheap price. There are many volunteers who are all very friendly and the area is always kept clean. Love this temple and would recommend for everyone to check out.",
   "Marble architecture that makes this amongst the most beautiful temples made in contemporary times and  its so accessible is amazing. You don't have to be a Hindu to visit the temple. you can go to visit, just have to have reverence and respect for a place of worship and people around who are praying. you will see people of other races visiting. they provide audio tours. if you are uncomfortable find an Indian friend and take a trip. a must visit place.",

But they have done incredible job. \nIt is not allowed to take pictures inside of temple but can take pictures from outside. It is not allowed to wear shorts or sleeveless blouse inside the temple else have to put wraparound provided in temple.",
   "Nice temple. Clean. Worth going and having a full platter of Indian gods. The canteen food is poor quality. Lot of insects and worms so beware. The packed food is fine but most of the Indian sweets are loaded with insane calories so it might crash your diet or workout results. Canteen is managed by some retired old men and they are not at all descent at the billing counter. Also the tray system sucks for picking up stuff. Over all architecturally it's amazing and the pond right outside is beautiful . The peacock I saw was just beautiful. Check out the pics"

The museum is not too visible from the road, but once you pass the gates, they have a good amount of parking. The building itself is is nicely organized, with well-constructed and informative displays spread out among the various rooms. One of my favorite things is a painting of the view from (what is now) a main door; it shows you what was there when the complex was full of large industrial buildings. They even discuss how the town was one of the first \"factory towns\" in America. I definitely recommend this museum for young and old. It's definitely worth the ride!",

Because there weren't any one else visiting at the time that we went we were able to get 1 on 1 treatment with the animals.  My children were able to fetch water as well as retrieve some eggs from the hens. They open up the barn so my kids could get out photo with the horses and also explained how to properly pet the sheep. will be back soon! awesome place to escape for free and let kids run around to breathe fresh air.",
   "A great family place to visit. Every volunteer is ready to share interesting facts about the animals on the farm. The food is made from what is harvested in the farm. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable. On weekends, they have different stations - blacksmith, kettle popcorn maker, and horse pulled hayrides. The walk to that hayride is super enjoyable as there is no pavement and you walk on a simple county road and over a small creek passing beautiful evergreens. Don\u2019t miss the chicken shed as you will know some interesting facts about hens.",

   "I come here mostly for the Amish market, which is great. I shop there for both ingredients and prepared foods. If there's time, I stroll around through the rest of the building but I usually don't buy anything because I'm already loaded up by that time. It's an older building with odd bumpy floors and a random assortment of stores. If you explore, you're sure to find something that interests you, and something that turns you off. As I mentioned, I don't do much else there except wander. With the exception of the winery -- I really enjoy their Mead. Oh and the produce stands across the parking lot. Great stuff. I never go on the weekends in summer so I can't report on the flea market. One day I'll get there. To avoid crowds, and to maximize the selection of donuts, best time to go is around 9 or 10 am. on a Thursday or Friday. It gets super crowded at lunch, and donuts fly off the shelves. \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf69",
   "It's busy but it's an awesome place to check out cheap products if all kind. All kinds of good food vendors in one place. Fun family outing for the day. Very dense with people so keep eyes on your little ones!",
   "Great place to shop when you are looking for some deals and discounts. Many shops to choose from, weekends are always packed and it's best to get there a head of time, friendly owners and it even has a food court if you need a break. My only downfalls for this place is that it's dated and isn't always clean. I feel if they added some new paint colors or add some flare to the place it would make it a little easier on the eyes but otherwise those are my only gripes with the place. I would recommend shopping here, even if you are just looking for a flea market and not outdoor vendors.",
   "They are the Best. You can Pretty much find everything you are looking for. Also, it was always a pleasant experience to weather you are buying or selling there. Weather you are New Or Used the Prices for a Table Are Reasonable. That used to be our Saturday morning date. We would get hot chocolate walk around shop & talk. It was great. That was our Special Time Together Alone Away from kids etc. OMG Columbus Market How we Miss You! We will be back when are out that way, for Sure!",
   "Lots of good stuff here.  Buy it's the food that brings me here most often.  Pete's pizza,  the Amish Market with roasted chickens and delicious, fall of the bone ribs. Excellent Korean place, Mexican, Polish, sandwiches,  one of the best fried chicken places around.  All good and reasonably priced."

   "Great place to just enjoy the day and some nj history! Great place for a long walk and great exercise!",
   "A lovely park. Friendly and informative staff at the visitors' center. Amazing Rev-War collection and display. The Johnson Ferry House is a rare treasure from the Rev-War period; the only structure on either side of the river that actually witnessed and was directly involved in the history Crossing for the Battle of Trenton. The interpreters at the Johnson Ferry House really know their stuff!",
   "For students of the American Revolution this is a must see. The park has interesting trails and a great view of the river crossing area. For hikers and those interested in history it is worth a visit."

   "A great place for a visit on the shore of the Delaware River. Our super cool and unique tour guide Kelly gave a fantastic tour filled with interesting historical facts about the history here   . Part farm and part re- created estate , Kelly led us across the estate from the visitors center and through the manor house and then into the kitchen house. A must see if in the Morrisville area!!",
   "Amazing hidden gem! The land it is built on is just as interesting as the Manor. As much info as you want and room for kids to run around. Farming, blacksmith and cooking demonstrations happening in the day we went.",
   "Wonderful historic site to visit, especially bring your animal lover as they have a working farm. A beautiful property with great character preservation.",
   "Great history here. Staff is knowledgeable & helpful, although noticeably weary from year-end school field trip frenzy."

It's like once upon time.....ohh..not boring you guys...but 2 decades back graduated from second oldest engineering college of India and today visited one of the finest Universities of USA. It gives an immense feeling of \" back to school\"....this  chapel is crown of the university campus.",

If you come here and you don't learn, you are a plant.\n\nMuseum, library, dormitories, sports facilities, coffee shops, everything.\n\nI'd say you can survive here without a car because they are bicycle friendly, but not sure, there are some places around that a student would like to visit like kayaking places.\n\nKnowledge is in the air here. Of course an opinion from an actual student would be required, but as a visitor I was impressed.",

It's really great to dive deeper into our local history... makes you appreciate your surroundings much more. I collect pins and was happy to see a pin honoring their  festival of trees. Easy to find. They have on site parking, but we parked in Palmer Square and enjoyed a nice walk over.",
   "Paid for a tour here and I guess I expected way more than was there. When it says \u201cgardens\u201d I think: multiple, lush, gardens that offer a variety to enjoy. But this really is one garden that\u2019s the size of a very small backyard. I was really surprised given the advertising and website just how tiny it was. There are 2 smaller gardens that have veggies as well, but they are mini gardens at best. Honestly, if you aren\u2019t really into local history and just dying to see a tiny garden (and not the original one- those garden plans have been lost), I would skip it.",
   "A nice museum in a colonial period house. Good place to visit if you are interested in local history or the Revolutionary War. I would recommend taking the tour as the guides are friendly and knowledgable. But you are also able to explore the house yourself and there are plenty of displays that will walk you through the history.",

Upper room with retail offerings, good for small parties.\n\nStage area with live music, decent acoustics.\n\nVisual Art of various styles is usually on display, most of which is for sale.\n\nStaffed by a knowledgeable and willing to assist team.  After several choices I settled on a red blend that reminded me of light \"chianti.\"\n\nI enjoyed a fresh made Sicilian Pizza with Salami (Pepperoni)\n\nFair prices and a little bit of a wait, but worth it."

   "It typically gets a little busy by the parking lot, even on weekdays. Lots of people enjoying barbecues or having kids birthday parties. Once you walk the trail a bit you see less people. The little shore is nice, and the Philadelphia skyline is beautiful. If you walk the full trail around it\u2019s a perfect distance for someone like me (who isn\u2019t very athletic or..... walkative.) There are maps by the front. There is a \u201cscenic overlook\u201d that isn\u2019t very scenic, but the overall walk is very pretty and enjoyable. If you show up earlier in the morning there are sometimes deer. Also a great place to take photography.",
   "Neshaminy State park is small it needs to commandeer 2 miles south past the campsite for the future the government has the money and it will give the federal government the ability to protect the waterways forever long past my day.... could use 100 Boy Scouts to clean up the debris low tide River's Edge by having a natural buffer you will create a Nature's Jewel.",
   "I went there for the 1st time yesterday. I actually really enjoyed it. There's a lot to do and a lot to see. I just can't wait for the summer for when the trees are green. It's very clean. I would definitely recommend coming here to anybody that is looking for a park to go to. Especially if you're into photography.",
   "Great place to go with the kids or just with my camera. Lots of wooded area with wildlife. Also trails that go right down along the Delaware River. Can walk the trails bring the kids bike/scooter and ride the paved areas. Either or it\u2019s a relaxing place and close by.",
   "One of my favorite places ever. Beautiful river views, plenty of winding trails, a large open field for recreation, and safely patrolled. It's easy to forget that Philly is only a couple of miles away, as Neshaminy is so heavily wooded.  I often spot deer, beavers, and other forest critters during my visits. I especially enjoy walking my dog along the river beach.\n\nWeekends and summer holidays this place is jam packed, so I recommend visiting Neshaminy on weekdays and cooler weather weekends and other off times."

   "This is a decent aquarium. It has a nice tunnel to walk through and the kids really enjoy the shark bridge, a webbed net bridge you walk over the shark tank on. They also really liked petting the sharks in one of the touch tanks. The problem is for the price you get less than you do at other aquariums. This is probably due to it being a fire profit rather than a nonprofit business.\n\nIt seems like they give lots of opportunities to spend money, more so than is typical. It feels like that takes away from part of the experience. They also do not seem to worry too much about meeting their own published schedules. Numerous things were late or seemed to be fine as afterthoughts.\n\nOverall it is a fine place to visit once or twice\nI would not see wanting to keep going back like I do most aquariums.",
   "It was a perfect size for our little guy. Our two teenagers zipper through it pretty quick. It has a little bit of everything. The wait outside was long, but it moved quickly. You have to go through the metal detectors, so when it's cold outside, it can feel like the process is taking forever. Once your inside, it's quite warm. We did not eat there, but it looked like basic kid friendly food. It was pretty crowded at some spots, but not unbearable.",
   "Best experience for me and my kids it was my first time to an Aquarium and i highly recommend!!! it\u2019s beautiful fun for parents an kids food was great I recommend ordering the tickets online through there website we got the meal an drink added with it made the day perfect after a fun filled day. Super fun u won\u2019t regret it parking is $10 for the day. I\u2019ll definitely be back loved it an so did my kids. Loved the shark tunnel",
   "Love coming here on weekends for the kids to expand their minds learning about aquatic life. We got season passes which I highly recommend. This place is great for kids of all ages only down side is the food and gift shop is extremely highly priced so eat before you go and skip the gift shop if you don\u2019t want to spend $20 for one item.",
   "Very nice! Since we went on a week day it was not too busy, even with kids on spring break. I loved how you could touch some of the animals and the shark tank was cool! The turtles we showing off.\ud83d\ude0a"

   "Bee going here ever since I was a little kid! Reenactments where always a highlight, and the museum is fantastic, with a great view of the majority of the park. Fun for light hikes all year round with well maintained trails. You may see all manner of animals as well from deer to foxes. A tip: popping on over to battlefield orchards when the hike is done is always great.",
   "One of the largest battles of the American Revolution took place in the fields and forests that now make up Monmouth Battlefield State Park. The park encompasses a playground for the kids, trails for light hiking and bicycle riding, picnic areas, a restored Revolutionary War farmhouse and a visitors center.\nThere is also the Battle of Monmouth Reenactment which is an annual event held each June at the park. Children can also participate in the cannon and musket drill that day. A treat for the young and old.\nNote: There are stations with plastic bags for the owners to pick up your furry babies poo. There are plenty of garbage bins for you to throw it away.",
   "Very beautiful historical park.  Informative display and movie in the visitor center, with friendly staff as well. Wish their were dedicated paths leading down to the battlefield, only because I felt bad walking on the grass. Definitely worth the visit.",
   "This is 1 of the most beautiful places I have been to in NJ.  I took so many beautiful pictures of my kids there.  The Apple orchard on the Battlefield is a welcomed byproduct as well, although the saving grace of it all is the ambiance.  Everyone should take a walk here in early fall.",
   "Great historical park and really educational. Neat place to visit even if history isnt your thing. Perfect place for a picnic too!"

It was a great way to spend an hour and I was happy to see my friend leave with more than he came. The energy that you feel in a casino with all the lights, colors and sounds is palatable. It makes for an excellent distraction for a few hours. Enjoy!",
   "Great atmosphere. Plenty of room to move around. Drinks are free and not watered down. The food is amazing. Variety of slots to choose from. You will and can win at slots. Haven't tried the table games yet. But people seem to be having fun playing them. Be a winner in no time and go to the Park. You won't regret it.",
   "Clean establishment, cocktail waitresses are very nice and prompt. Food is amazing and if you keep up with the player perks you get some really good rewards. They have valet parking which I've never tried and the only down part is the ID check before entering the floor. I've had to return back to my car a couple times before because I forgot.",
   "Best Casino by far in a 200 mile radius. Your first impression when strolling on to Park is...WOW! Has a young and hip vibe for sure. They are professional. Pay promptly and offer multiple payout options. Thanks Parx Casino!!! 5 Stars....",
   "Its a large open space. Has lots of slots and a huge table playing area. Staff are friendly and they actually compensate you for playing sending out free slot plays and comps monthly. Very neat. Bathrooms are up to fancy. Service is exceptional. One of my go it's when i want to play!"

Great walking paths that get you close to the water or out in the middle of the woods. The boat rentals are not bad (just get their early or be prepared to wait during the weekends). They also have a few playgrounds for the little ones. Great place to watch the sun set or rise!",
   "A great place to get some exercise on the trails, both paved and unpaved. Great place for a family picnic, small group gathering or just by yourself. It has become very popular and the biggest problem is adequate parking area on busy weekends. Otherwise a great place to get some fresh air and sunshine.",

I was fortunate enough to get a one on one tour as it was a weekday afternoon but I had a blast. Seeing the castle and understanding more about Mercer's legacy was really awesome. Had no idea the castle even was here in PA but glad I stumbled across it in my travels. Thanks again to everyone who made my experience fantastic. Highly recommended!",
   "My interior design class took a trip here and the Moravian tile factory. It was definitely worth the drive and everything and every room was beautiful. One of the first rooms we walked into opened up with a beautifully tiled ceiling. It was absolutely amazing",
   "The castle was so cool! We loved it. Our tour guide and the entire staff was very knowledgeable as well. I don't want to spoil the looks of the castle but it definitely is a must-see for a great price. The tour lasted for around an hour to an hour and a half. The only suggestion I will make is that there really should be a minimum age requirement. There were a couple of very young toddlers in our tour group which was very distracting, and they were running around and crashing into displays. It really is not a safe environment for young children or for the castle itself, as children like to play around and touch things. Other than that, its an awesome trip!",
   "Fonthill Castle was very interesting. I did not know much about Mercer before going here. The tile work on display was fabulous. The type of the castle was great too.",
   "What a terrific experience! Fonthill castle is an amazing place with tons of history. The tour cost was very affordable and the tour was so good! Our tour guide Kevin was so knowledgeable and friendly! I highly recommend taking the tour!"

The staff was incredibly kind and helpful. The gift shop is awesome as well. I can't wait to go back.",

I would not hesitate to go back.",
   "It is a great historical place to visit. Layer out very well. Self guides your gives you the opportunity to look at things more than once. Plenty of seats along the way ... it is a long walk ,Just a  Heads up.  Pretty cool to stand in places the Admiral stood and to see Admiral's, Captains quarters, Crew quarters and gun turrets and Helicopter. ... Well done Crew!",
   "I had a pleasing experience. Love the history that was presented on my self guided tour. Not too crowded when I went. Wish I had more time to explore more of the ship. Noticed there was even a little kids section which was cute. I was only able to see one level of the ship but the experience was great.",
   "I enjoyed my visit to this historic ship. Very friendly helpful staff, lots to see and great views from the ship too. A must see for history buffs or anyone wanting a window in to a different era. Able to enter many parts of the ship including the gun turrets. Thankful to have lived in a time where my military service was un needed. Being in those turrets in the heat of battle is unfathomable."

   "Great food as always. So many varieties to select from. I cant try them at once. But you'll definitely want to. I doubt you'll see any foods that won't capture your culinary curiosity or desire. I've always found the variety of foods served their to be nothing nut delicious. Fresh baked cakes and pies courtesy of our friendly neighbors from Lancaster County, the Amish merchants providing fresh homemade recipe dishes and beverages. Their candy section makes my sweet tooth come alive. Of course you can't end a meal without ice cream. Different flavors to also satisfy your desire for sweet delights. I personally also love having a gyro or other samples of Greek foods. Domestic or international cuisine are all under one roof for you to enjoy. You'll have to see and taste what I'm talking about.",
   "Absolutely love this gem of Philadelphia. The Cajun sandwiches are a must try. The one with steak, pepperoni and cheeses amazing. We also tried the alligator sausage, which was a bit lighter than the steak and cheese. I\u2019d recommend getting both and trying half of each.\n\nThe produce section has incredible prices and love the selection of fresh fruits and dried fruits. \n\nIt can be tough to get seating especially during peak times. Just keep your eye out and know you might have to share a small table with strangers. If the weather is nice, there\u2019s plenty of nearby seating if you take a walk outside. \n\nAlso there are multiple bathroom stalls in the back and in my experience they\u2019ve always been clean. Fill up your water bottle at the water fountain next to the bathrooms to avoid spending $2-3 on water.",
   "This place is wonderful! As soon as you walk in the smell of the different foods makes you want to eat everything. Always busy but a very friendly atmosphere. Also the staff is very helpful and will take the time to actually walk you to a specific shop that you're looking for.",
   "Wow! This place has it all when it comes to choices of places to eat and drink. If you cannot find anything you like here, you are not trying! If anything, there is too many choices. Wonderful place to visit and enjoy. A visit to Philly should include stopping here often. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, though if convention going on, lines for lunch are out the door! My favorite place to go when in town for a convention,  it is just across the street!",
   "I visited Bee Natural a boutique if the sorts that offers handmade/homemade candles, lip balms, hand creams and a variety of all natural bee wax products. They must have at least 15-20 different lip balms in flavors like green tea, pumpkin, pizza, vanilla lavender, currants, peppermint and so many more. They are only $2.50 each which makes you want to grab a couple of different scents. The glide on smooth without any waxy residue which is nice. The also have lovely hand-carved honeycomb candles reasonable price that make great gifts."

I would recommend this to any train lover or person who likes a good day out.",
   "Good place to ride 100 years old train. However keep in mind that steam engine is not running every weekend,  and even on the days it is scheduled to be, not necessarily you will ride steam but not diesel (also kind of historical,  but not steam). Additionally, as both engines are old, there are possibly of delays. We had a delay for about 25 minutes as they had issue connecting the engine to the cars. Besides that- it is worth if every penny spent. Nice 30 minutes (one way) ride (you are paying for the round trip though). Conductors will tell you a history of this railroad and the cars. Good views. Ringoes has a gift shop and a small in-car museim and a restroom. My family was very pleased with this trip. BTW, for those with small kids - during Christmas time they are running polar express.",
   "Fun family-friendly train ride during the holidays. Tickets include the out-and-back ride (~12 miles total) on historic trains, hot cocoa, cookie, mini-museum, and Santa photo (check beforehand, as Santa isn't there all days). Train cars have antique wood burning stove heaters.",
   "The train ride was fun and the museum was pretty interesting, kids will love this place.",
   "This was a fun train ride for the whole family! It was extra special since Santa and his elves were roaming the train the whole time! This will be a Christmas time tradition for my family."

   "We visited with family. This is a great place with dedicated people that helps educate the public. Highly recommended as it is both a wonderful experience and an informative presentation. All of the animals are very smart and a pure joy to be around.",
   "This place is a Wolf Sanctuary, over here they have different session for them being that they cant all be together. It was a really cool experience to learn so much about them, how they live, think, and how amazing they\u2019re. Definitely some of the most amazing and smartest creatures on earth. Samson the old guy was so adorable despite earning his name after ripping a door in half, pretty much when they\u2019re eating their pray, the only part they don\u2019t eat is the Jaw, other than that they chew on every single other bone, they\u2019re compassionate and loving towards little ones, and care for them. Our group guide was amazing, informative and passionate about it, however we found out at the end that it was his first presentation, which we couldn\u2019t believe. It kinda stared raining at some point, so they kindly let me use a spare jacket they had, they also go by a suggested $20 donation, which is not bad at all, they have a gift shop as well. Glad to see so many beauties rescued. Btw some of them are mixed and adoptable."

   "Went to this place with my sister and nephew in the beginning of March.The zoo was beautiful and really enjoyed the wrap around tunnel cages that go overhead. Some of the animals were not out considering the time of year but would definitely recommend as a great family place to bring you children. Would love to see some elephants in the future and maybe a nocturnal animal exhibit.",
   "I really enjoy this zoo.  My wife and i are from Baltimore and we would rather go to the Philadelphia Zoo instead of the one here.  It feel a lot safer, it definitely cleaner and has ample, easy to find bathrooms.  I have been to the Philadelphia zoo many times; many exhibits are the same, but some have changed.  Very enjoyable experience.",
   "Literally one of my favorite places in Philly. I buy a season pass every year. The staff is PHENOMENAL, especially considering my youngest sister is handicapped. Staff is knowledgeable,friendly,and patient. The exhibits are beautiful and the zoo is clean. So many fun activities to do and secret quiet areas for when we need to take a minute. I suggest everyone not only visit Philadelphia zoo, but to take it all in as the wonderful experience it is.",
   "Was pretty good but like any other zoo you don't see a lot of animals! They have their moments! Both kids enjoyed the indoor / outdoor learning adventure! Weather was mild for Philadelphia winter 50F degree",
   "One of the best Zoo which is located in Philadelphia, United States. The Zoo where we can see varieties of Animals. And covered with Plants & Trees. Quite love watching & observing the Animals. Full enjoyment & truly it is like Adventure. Recommended to visit!"

We were so fortunate to find Rozmaryn!\n\nWe ended up reserving the table near the front of the restaurant, which was perfect. The food was so warm and welcoming--just like my grandmother used to make. We brought some Polish beers from across the street. Service was wonderful; our server was proactive and considerate, even though they were short on staff that day.\n\nI'm so sad that I don't pass through town more often! Am hoping to make plans to return someday.",

All of the vegetables were evenly mixed, if I had know the salad was like that, I would have ordered a large one. I had the seafood with pasta mild, and it was delicious"

   "More a birthday celebration than romantic dinner spot. Fun guitar and singing, candles in some yummy rice pudding for both events. A bit noisy and the only two-seat tables face the kitchen doors. Attentive serving staff, will likely upgrade your request for a glass of sangria into pitcher. Beware: Potent potables. Steak and shellfish--delicious. Duck--eh. Easy, well lit parking. The bar is quieter than dining room. Worth another visit.",

   "Went for Happy Hour here after being told it was nice during a conversation. I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, imagining it to mostly be like drinking in a pizza shop. \nThey do indeed have a pizza shop which looked as though it had much to offer on its menu boards.\nBut I sat at the bar in the restaurant.\nI ordered a Cosmopolitan and it was done perfectly, and is part of the happy hour drink specials. \nFor food, I tried the nachos which were excellent. The toppings were all nicely blended and melted together with.the cheese, and not just an assortment of ingredients piled on chips.\nService was Very friendly and welcoming.\nI had a look at the main menu and must say it is quite extensive with very reasonable prices.\nI look forward to returning for a dinner experience soon!\nI recommend Cafe Antonio's highly",

A meal with a drink is about $12+ and unfortunately, this means I can't eat there as often as I would like to.  The staff are friendly and the seating is good; although it's a bit cold near the doors and windows.  It was also just a little too dark near the counter.  I would have liked a little more lighting.",

Sauce had a nice flavor \nCons-\n1.My least favorite dish was the Mac n cheese.the cheese used did not give the taste a kick. Didn't really taste seasoned. \n2.The string beans didn't have much flavor either. The collard greens were okay. \n3.Potato salad was offered as a menu item but the waitress informed us that there was no more .Before offering the menu items, items should be verified. \nI decided to try this restaurant because it was suggested to me. I was disappointed because as a soul food restaurant Mac n cheese and collard greens should be on point.

The owner of the parking lot will tow your car.",

The fried chicken/rib combo was moist and flavorful; baked beans were deliciously seasoned with pineapple chunks baked in; breaded mushrooms were finished first, corn was perfectly seasoned, and to top it off the cookie tray was a perfect dessert. The owner Reggie was easy to work with and always professional. I would definitely use this business again.",

Got beans and mac & cheese sides.  M&C was cheesy, beans were excellent.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Pro tip: the bbq is mainly dry rub, so if you like it \"wet\", don't hesitate to order some extra sauce.  Their sauces are amazing, btw! Ribs and chicken were both cooked to perfection.",

There were a couple instances of things I didn't like but I don't feel like putting all that down but this was the most recent incident...",
   "I was looking for a restaurant to grab dinner before attending a graduation ceremony at the nearby Cure Arena and I came across this spot. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and have an extensive menu of entr\u00e9e, sandwich, sides and dessert soul food options (many of which have creative names) that are all full of flavor. The prices are reasonable, portions are generous and they provide fast, friendly service . The restaurant has a warm and homey d\u00e9cor and the counter staff was friendly. Parking is on the street."

   "Good food! Friendly staff!! Best Jamaican food I\u2019ve had on the east coast!! Had to eat it two days in a row!",
   "This place was recommended to me by someone who's never been here before! So since I was in the area I decided why not, I'll try them! I called ahead like the ratings suggested. Well I still waited for the food, no biggie right!! The lovely young lady that took my order was very nice in the phone and in person(I can't say that much for the heavy set young man at all). So that made the fact I was waiting ok. I get back to where I was to eat..... 1st. They only give me four very dry, and cold plantains with the meat combo (it's a large with two choices of meat) 2nd. The cabbage was very very hard not steamed just cut and served. Now I like a little crunch to my cabbage but this was just raw cabbage. 3rd. I got one piece of jerk chicken, it was very flavorful and cold. 4th. I got Curry goat also cold. I was only 5 minutes away from where I was going so no way after I waited and the 5 minutes drive should it have been cold! I thought the price was good for what I ordered, the service (from the young lady) was good, but the food should've been warmer, and cooked just a little longer (just the cabbage) and just maybe, no not maybe more chicken. Overall I'd give them another try to redeem themselves. This restaurant doesn't have a eat in setting it's small, but seems to be very clean. I suggest ordering ahead. Parking is street parking.",
   "Great food, anything you get is great but be mindful to call ahead as they sometimes don't have your first or second choice.",
   "Food is excellent. Especially the ox tail. Love love love their food",

The manager made sure everything was set up and going just how I wanted. He reserved seats so me and all my friends  can eat together and even a section in the lounge area where we were able to dance and enjoy my birthday. The two waiter Alex and Michelle were very attentive and kind and made sure our food and drinks were exactly how we wanted. Me and my friends are always treated with respect and like family when we go there. They made sure I had a great birthday. They have the best drinks , food and music and for good price! Thank you Sabor Latino",

It tastes like something you with find in Cracker Barrel their version of enchilada verde is rotisserie chicken in tortillas with chicken gravy poured on top! The costarican rice tasted like Chinese food and was full of chicken fat (see picture below). I would not recommend. We came here a few years ago and it was good but since there\u2019s a new cook it\u2019s really bad.",

This is our new favorite Mexican spot in the area.",

I was convinced the lady must\u2019ve misheard me but as I tried to explain she just hung up. I called back to try and clarify, but she repeatedly just said no we don\u2019t do that. I was truly baffled. Then it got to the point they said they had no more drivers and hung on me again! What a joke. Never ordering here again. The good food certainly is not worth the headache."

   "I Love there Jumbo Shrimp. The food is very tasty..",
   "Well, I visited after they reopened and it was not good.  The breading has clearly changed on the fish and scallops.  The breading just fell of and the fish and scallops were not thoroughly cooked.  It was a waste of time and money and my stomach was SUPER upset afterwards.  It's a shame because Trenton has no real good seafood or soul food and I was hoping this would be great and it just wasn't.",
   "Only problem my chicken you can really taste the Salt",
   "I got the shrimp basket with fries for $8.50 not worth that amount for 6 shrimp and a small amount of fries. The candied yams were def good. The sweet potatoe pie you can get at any cornerstore in trenton for $1.50. Super dissapointed that they have a sign with grilled shrimp , lobster and crab legs with corn but you dont offer that platter that was my whole reason for going there. First and last time there.",

   "If the City of Trenton has an award ceremony for the best-flavored restaurant, where do I place my vote? First of all, when my coworker and I  walked into Delia empanadas cafe, we where immediately HIT with the vibe, music, and compassion of the Latin culture. The establishment is clean and eccentric! I also love the fact that I can see the chefs cooking and dancing; enjoying what they do.  As a vegetarian always breaking my neck trying to find a place to cater to my taste buds, I think I finally found my spot. One word...Victoria\ud83d\ude18",
   "Delia's Empanada Cafe is a beautifully renovated Puerto Rican restaurant in downtown Trenton. This restaurant is located directly next to the restaurant \"The Big Easy.\" Be aware there is no signage outside indictating the name of the restaurant at this time. They are open Monday to Friday from 9am to 4 pm. If you are looking for a wheelchair accessible option, there is one small step up to get into the restaurant but the bathroom appears accessible. The menu features a variety of items including breakfast and dessert options. Make no mistake, their empanadas are the star. We ordered 5 different types of empanadas, a shrimp mofongo dish, and 2 drinks. Our order totaled $39.00. For the amount and quality of food, I felt this was a great deal. The empanadas were large and filled generously. They were seasoned well and not greasy like other competitors. The crust is soft, flaky, and golden brown. They also came with their own homemade dipping sauce. The flavors of empanadas that we chose were shrimp, chorizo and plantain, plantain and corned beef, ground beef, and guava and cheese. The shrimp mofongo was also generous and filling with large shrimp and a bold criolla sauce. This was very well done and the shrimp was very fresh. We were served by the very charming owner Jose Pantoja who assured us that all the food was home made and everything we ate was delicious (I've have eaten out enough to know that this is not always the case). The food also came to us very quickly. We were able to complete lunch in under 40 minutes eating slowly. Although not advertised on the menu, they also offer various locally made desserts. All in all, Delia's Empanada Cafe is a great locally-owned casual lunch spot with  a reasonable price point. I wish this business the best of luck and success in the future.",
   "Love love the food - everything is delicious - my coworkers & I eat there for lunch at least once a week!! \ud83e\udd5f\ud83e\udd58\ud83c\udf70\ud83c\udf7d\ud83e\udd64",
   "Food is always well flavored and tasty.  Huge variety of empanadas which are always delicious.  Small tip..harder ahead for your food because they prepare it fresh everytime.  Luv it!!!",
   "The food here is delicious and rather well priced. Most days, during lunchtime, the line is incredibly long, so that should tell you something!"

The food is poorly seasoned and has no flavor. I'm not fond of the customer service either. Laughing at customers makes you and your food look suspect.

They have a young crew of cooks back there so maybe the lack of experience maybe me the issues. Also the lack of cleanliness there's dust all over the air conditioning vents. The mens bathroom look like a crack house , I'm just being honest. I still gave them 3 stars because of flavor and the portions are good.. I feel like eating at this place is rolling the dice you might get good you might get bad take your chances.",
   "Excellent service, and good variety of food, until now is the best Guatemalan cuisine in town. Nothing different from other nearby Guatemalan restaurants, Very good portion to be satisfied, at a good price ... my five stars to this GuateLinda.\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c",
   "I love this spot can\u2019t wait to go back!",
   "DELICIOUS FOOD! Great prices and lovely service. Love their natural pineapple juice. Love this place. I\u2019ll be coming back again!",
   "Guatelinda is quite simply, one of the best places to get affordable, delicious, Guatemalan style food. But before I get into this, let me explain the menu a little bit.\n\nIf you look at the menu and really think about it, most of Guatelinda's menu is a remix of the same ingredients. Do you want pork, chicken, and steak? Or do you just want steak? Or do you want steak with plantains? Or do you want pork with steak and plantains? Or Do you want steak and shrimp?\n\nThat's pretty much the gist of it. Along with the chicken, steak, and pork combos you can get tacos, tostadas, breakfast menu items, and a few other selections that I can't remember off the top of my head.\n\nThe point is, the food is extremely delicious and flavorful, though some with a sensitive palate might think it's salty. Every item has its own distinct taste and compliments the 5 star quality rice and beans sides. In fact, some people, like my mother, only eat at Guatelinda to enjoy their rice and beans. Crazy!\n\nThe drink selection is full of Latino favorites. You can order a pineapple mango drink, horchata drink, or choose from a selection of Mexican sodas called Jarritas.\n\nThe portions are enormous, so do not come here if you're not hungry. You absolutely need to bring an appetite because you are going to be well-fed with just one entr\u00e9e. And with how inexpensive the menu items are, you are going to be tempted to order a lot of food. I don't recommend this unless you're planning to take it home.\n\nIf I have anything to nitpick about Guatelinda, it has to be the parking. Rarely is there a parking spot in front of the restaurant and often you're forced to pull into a driveway that will scrape the bumper of any low riding cars. The traffic and drivers in this part of the neighborhood are reckless and obnoxious so be careful if you're going to dine in.\n\nThey do offer take out and they do deliver, so certainly make sure to use those options if dealing with terrible drivers is not for you.\n\nIf I'm hungry, on a budget, and want good Spanish food, Guatelinda will be first on my list to call."

To be honest, we hadn't ordered from them to this point because their online presence lacks, so other places seemed easier in the moment.  All that said, we found a menu in the photos here on Google Maps. I like that the menu is short - it makes choosing much simpler.  We called in the order and it was ready and perfect when I arrived 15 minutes later.  We had a chicken platter w/white sauce and combo platter w/ white and Bbq sauce. Both were amazing! Also amazing was the hummus.  We love (and occasionally make our own) hummus and this was better than we can remember ever having.  We'll be back soon and often.",

It is right next to the Empire Discount Liquor store on the corner of South Broad and Liberty Streets. In fact the wheelchair accessible outside door is shared by both businesses.",
   "Highly disappointed in the food! Had chicken bones in my quesadilla and the food overall was mediocre. They were late on my delivery and my food was cold. I won't be ordering again unfortunately.",
   "1 of 2 locations in Trenton. Attached to a packaged goods store noth of which are new. Smallish sitting area for ~25 people. Flat screen TV wonderful staff. Very reasonable prices, authentic Spanish food. Share 3 \"platters\" with 2 others, perfect amount of food. We took recommendations from our Server. Fried fish, Fajitas and a mixed plate of grilled pork, chicken, steak. All of the food was absolutely delicious! Will return and bring others.",
   "The El Chapin Restaurant is very small. Just a few tables. No parking lot so must find off street parking.\n The food is made to order. It may take a bit longer but it is worth the wait. \n  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.\n   We all ordered a different entree. It arrived hot and delicious.  Most of us had to ask for a take home bag because the portions were so big. \n  We were there to celebrate a birthday and the staff gave the birthday girl a free piece of cheesecake and sang \u201cHappy Birthday \u201c with us.\n  Definitely recommend this restaurant.",
   "Great food. People In & out ordering from Chapin their food is made well and tasty."

   "Newly opened, completely renovated. Wonderfully designed. Friendly staff. Music can be loud. On this visit I was with a group of 11, Trenton Eat Local Club. Food is fresh prepared so it may take a few minutes, be patient. Full service bar, good margaritas.  We started off with house made chips and salsa. My meal was Adoba Seasoned Pork strips delicious!  Served with white rice and black beans, small salad.  ",

   "Really good food. Portions are great for the price. It's not really an eat in place but there are 3 tables. Most people order out. I'm glad we ate there because it was nice and hot. Will go again.",
   "I moved to the area from the shore, so I know and love my seafood. It's not fresh off the boat but it's damn delicious. I was looking for somewhere to get a decent seafood dinner and I've found my spot. Portions were enormous, Prices were very fair, and the food is delicious. Only had a few of the broiled platter but being this far from the sea, this place cures the craving. It's busy most nights and I've learned best idea is to order ahead and pick it up. Definitely give it a try.",

The cornbread served was pretty good, also. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and will definitely be coming back. Oh, yeah all our dinners were \"large\" so that might be why the sides were so big.
