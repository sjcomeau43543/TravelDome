   "Nine friends and I booked a 5-hour photography tour. I knew it was going to be cool but it exceeded all of my expectations. Our guide, Larry, actually used to work at the facility and share so many personal stories with us. There were certain areas that had some tornado damage so we were unable to tour then but even then we didn\u2019t run out of locations in the five hours. Our guide was also patient with us photographing high and low every 3 feet too. If you enjoy history of a different kind and abandoned places it will be an exceptional visit for you too.",
   "Awesome tour, tour guides are previous guards, warden. They have first hand knowledge of this place. Too scared to do the overnight ghost tour, so I went during the day. It was even a little scary during daylight. Very cool place, and prices very reasonable to tour.",
   "Tour was very informative about the history of this facility.  You have the opportunity to see where the inmates lived and about some well known people who resided there. There is a lot of walking so where comfortable shoes.",
   "We took the two hour tour (cold and damp in November so bring a hat and dress warmly) led by a former employee of many years. He had also studied well and knew so many interesting facts. This place is absolutely fascinating and huge. From his descriptions, I could totally imagine what it would have been like to be there back in the day. Great job.",
   "Larry and Kathy were great Tour guides! Very informative and entertaining!  Had a great time."

   "Jefferson City has a nice downtown area mixing historic and modern buildings. The state capitol is worth a visit, not necessarily as a destination stop, but certainly for an hour or two break if you're passing through; or, as we did, make Jefferson City a stop for the night when traveling I-70 (it's only about 30 miles south of Columbia). Our highlights are the Thomas Hart Benton paintings in the House Lounge and several of the lunettes on the second floor (the tour guide pointed out the best ones). We also enjoyed exhibits on Missouri natural history.",
   "I would definitely recommend taking a tour of the capital of the state of Missouri great art structures to be seen great place to take photographs lots of local venues Restaurant shopping in Jefferson City can make it worth the trip depending where you live Grounds of the capital or beautifully kept I recommend fall of the year early spring after they implanted all the flowers. A great One day road trip for residence and a beautiful place to stop for anyone passing through the state.",

   "Very pretty building, even if construction prevents you from seeing the outside.",

   "Always a treat to visit McKay Park.  It is a wonderful natural setting with the most user friendly features.  The paved walk trail around the lake always has people of all ages walking/jogging through the pleasant scenery.  An updated large playground always has the giggles and laughter of children playing.  Today a unique surprise as a RC control operator was flying his \"seaplane\" on the glassy afternoon lake surface....and finally my main pursuit of happiness there today was the call of the Lake's most recently stocked Rainbow Trout...and my call was answered many times over catching and releasing several of these beauties.  Describing this experience as a \"little bit of heaven on earth\" might be a bit of a stretch...but after I left today I felt again that it is....!   Highly recommended.\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
   "The playground in this park is first rate, with a structure for little kids and another bigger structure for older kids. The bigger structure is tall, almost two stories. There are several different climbing options, and two slides in the bigger structure. Plus there are a couple of sets of swings. The lake is at least an acre. The sidewalks and lawn are nice all around the lake.",
   "Trout fishing, dog walking, kids playground, 3 parking areas. There is a nice picnic area by the \"lake\" or rather pond and down the hill nice area to play soccer or other lawn sports.",
   "Today was a very nice day and much needed fresh air. My nephews definitely enjoyed themselves.",

There are a few overlooks to stop at along the way with displays that explain the geological processes taking place and the wildlife (bats, trogolobites) inside the cave.",

It can be a bit muddy if there's been any rain, but if that's the case the devil's icebox trail is mostly boarded walkway, so there's always somewhere to go.

   "This is a nice park for hiking, camping, and fishing. The trails are easy and good for any age or fitness level. The views are awesome. The camping is nice. There are three entrances to the park, so preplanning is necessary.",
   "Excellent walking trail with beautiful overlooks of the Osage River.  Very peaceful and quiet and a good workout as well.\n     If you can't walk down hills or up inclines, you may not want to tackle this walk as it is a little rocky in areas and can be slick when wet and challenging in the heat.",
   "1.6 mile trail, two viewpoints of the Osage, took my GF and I about 1 hour to hike the trail with our dogs.  Great scenery and absolutely beautiful!! I'm 65 with bad knees. Trail is kinda rugged but I made it with ease. Several benches along the trail to rest on. Great hike!!!",

   "Went by today with our 2 young boys on vacation.  Had a great time, it was just our family on the 12 noon tour, which was kinda cool to get a personalized tour.  Thanks to Lee our tour guide for taking us through the 4 level cave!  Many great features that we got to see close up.  Our 6 & 8 boys were very focused and like it.  Lee \"played\" well to the kids.  Warm inside the cave.  Had as nice gift shop with souvenirs and nature books for kids etc.  Cool clothing options.  They were getting ready for a really cool Valentine's event on the cave which may be why when we first showed up the door was locked and we didn't see anyone at first.  But then someone came to help us, that would be the only negative of the experience.  Keep in mind their tours are 10, 12, 2 and 4 each day.",
   "Wow!!!! Paula is an AMAZING guide! She knows her stuff and is super friendly and helpful. Staff appeared knowledgeable and professional and the caverns are beautiful! I suggest spending a little more money for the Black Light Tour. We had an amazing experience and will definitely be back!!! (Also, the gift shop prices are appropriate and affordable). Love it!!!!!!!!",
   "This was so much fun! I did the black light cave tour and the woman that was our tour guide was absolutely AMAZING. She was very knowledgeable and taught us about the caves, mineral deposits, how the formations are made and even taught us about luminescence. Very cool experience. If you have a chance to go, I highly recommend getting on her tour. Great experience!",
   "This Cavern is super cool with 4 shelves to explore lots of Beauty and history a must-see for cave lovers! Tour guides are awesome very informative friendly and considerate.",
   "I just went to Stark Caverns after seeing all the positive reviews online, this place is phenomenal. It\u2019s worth noting that I got there an hour before the first tour and would\u2019ve missed it due to my flight, but Paula (the tour guide) was able to bring me, so a huge thank you for that... The caves themselves are absolutely amazing, so many millions of years of geologic history, you\u2019ll see countless different types of formations. It\u2019s just absolutely intriguing, especially to hear all the history of the cave intermixed with the geologic aspects on the tour. They\u2019ve also done a magnificent job of lighting the caves In a way that blends in without detracting from their natural beauty. I\u2019ve been in several different game systems at this point, and each has their own flavor and character, Stark Caverns is an absolute must see whether it\u2019s your first time or you\u2019re a seasoned caver... One last note, there are actual ancient physical human remains on display that were found in the cave and interred respectfully, adding a level of gravity to the experience that you won\u2019t get anywhere else. Thank you guys for an amazing tour!"

   "Really wonderful large park in the middle of Columbia, bringing nature to the city. Has lots of small pavilions around and multiple playgrounds, plus lots of empty space great for small gatherings or other outside activities.",
   "Well designed park with something for everyone. Free swimming and splash  fountain in the  summer. It's a great place to walk or jog.",
   "A Park that rivals other City Parks in similar sized communities.  Having a Memorial Bench and Heritage Tree in this Park makes it extra special for me and my family to visit from time to time.  The Lake is large, clear and defines the heart of the space.  With an interior paved walking path around the perimeter of the Lake, as well as a longer paved walking and running trail the Park gives persons options for leisure walking and exercise / fitness pursuits.   An amphitheater provides outdoor concerts and a venue for special annual events such as Roots-N-Blues-N-BBQ in the Fall.   The Park is also home to the Annual Art in the Park event and a perfect backdrop for patrons of the arts to enjoy viewing the creations of artists from around the United States.   A Splash-Park is also another feature of Stephens Lake Park and one very suitable for children.",
   "Beautiful park! Nice walking trail and plenty of field to host family outings",
   "A very open and beautiful park with docks and walkways on the lake, a playground, small waterfalls and plenty of benches to sit down and relax to just enjoy nature. The bathrooms could certainly use more care, but this is the only issue I have with this park. It's a wonderful place for a picnic, gathering, or just a place to get away and relax."

   "A rare and beautiful example of a formal garden with plant varieties in abundance.  It is evident that the Shelter Insurance Company has invested time, money, and thoughtful planning in this oasis of a park on the edge of Columbia.  With the corporate buildings nearby, and a large apartment complex bordering one side of the gardens, it is still quiet, peaceful, and serene.  A place where one can go to walk, be alone, be quiet in an otherwise noisy world.  Time set aside in Shelter Gardens to think, pray, meditate, wander aimlessly, or spread a blanket and lay underneath a canopy of clouds is time well spent.  A true treasure of Columbia, Missouri and not to be missed at any season of the year.",
   "Great place to go with family or by yourself. Covered shelter available and paved path to walk on. Especially beautiful in spring or fall. A favorite for my family.",
   "Peaceful, well-maintained Park with paved pathways winding around the 5 acre property. Enjoy multiple water features & waterfall with coy pond. I liked that all of the vegetation & tree variations were labeled. All 5 senses go to work & I can imagine how this place must look fully bloomed on a sunny day (cloudy morning today). There's also an old schoolhouse you can walk into, sit down or leave your mark on the chalkboards. Love this place!",
   "Great place to spend time with family but some area were not properly maintained and there were street dogs everywhere.",
   "Beautiful and tranquil, the perfect place to just walk or sit, and put your mind at ease.... or have a picnic! This gorgeous outdoor area also offers an educational benefit to botany students, or any green thumb enthusiast, as all the trees and shrubs are labeled. Another plus to this already free-to-public outdoor area is that it makes a great photo op for any occasion, complete with stone pathways, fountains, flowers, evergreens, a gazebo and even and old school house!  Doggy mess bag/drop off stations are  available at the entry to help maintain the garden's cleanliness."

   "An overlooked trail in COMO. More curves than MKT but gives more scenic look. From rivers to meadows to woods to open clearings. Flat but some slight inclines. Connects to MKT as well. Great hiking areas and spaces for dogs off leash."

You could not ask for better assistance in regard to supplements, diet, nutrition, & exercise.",

Even though I knew exactly what I wanted, he visited with me and helped me find everything I needed.  He was very pleasant, upbeat, and positive.  He also asked me if I had any questions or was interested in trying anything new.  I definitely always enjoy my time while I am there.  I love the products as well."

   "This is not a stand-alone museum, but rather a series of galleries in a university building. Nonetheless, there is a good range of art and artifacts to check out. While there are few iconic works, the antiquities collection is extensive and nicely curated. Objects are well-labeled, but the European and American galleries lack introductory level labels. I also hope that there are numbers to help match objects to labels in the antiquities galleries, as it isn't always easy to figure out the pictorial guides.\n\nI don't know why this place is separate from the downtown and campus areas of Columbia, but I think it is worth a little extra effort to come here when you are in town. Admission is free, and the staff are very helpful. Last but not least, be sure to pay a visit to the Museum of Anthropology next door. Who would have thought that it is home to \"one of the largest and most comprehensive [archery collections] in the world\"? Not to mention that local archaeology and history are presented there as well.",
   "Parking and entrance is free. Exhibits are split between the first and second floor. This was moved from the main campus when their building was being renovated. It is in an old cancer research building and renamed Mizzou campus north. The first exhibit and the largest is to the right as you enter the main doors under the covered drop off entrance.  The gift shop is in front of you to the left and the elevator is just past the gift shop. The stairs are also just to the left as you come in. When you come out of the elevator turn left to go to the exhibits. Coming out of the stairs it is a slight left then right.  I mention all of this since it isn't obvious unless someone is there to assist you as you come in. The exhibits are wonderful. Most seem to be permanent installations with a few that cycle in and out. The north campus location is nice since you don't have to fight campus traffic or pay for parking. It is close to I-70 and could be a quick stop while driving through town.",
   "Awesome place to visit and is free!!! Donations are welcome and well-deserved. A lot of work is clearly put into the upkeep. Very nice exhibits.",
   "Small free University Museum.  Some pretty cool items in the collection,  well curated,  and the right price.  Worth checking out if you find yourself in the COMO area.",

Highly recommend if you have never been.",

   "Absolutely a kid favorite place.  The kids maze is HUGE! All of the ride lines are extremely short, and most of the time you get directly on. The go-karts are FAST! Trouble with arcade games, the staff usually fix immediately.  The pizza is very good and priced accordingly as well.",
   "A truly great place for the whole family to have a great time with many options for entertainment",
   "The place was nice. My son enjoyed playing in their maze indoor playground. Some of the arcade machines were not working though. The Jurassic Park arcade game was very exciting to play with. The go kart was good too since they have a good space to run the kart around. \nThe prizes were all right. I really appreciate one of the staff who gave my son a free small toy since I did not redeem the tickets he won from the arcade coz I was planning to get more tickets for a better toy. He saw my son looking at the prizes and he gave him something small but really touched my heart and made my little boy smile. Great to see you have a staff who is sensitive and has a big heart. I did not get his name but I hope the management will notice that kind of person."

   "A must stop if you are biking the Katy trail. The climb is steep, but not tremendously hard or dangerous. If you do the climb, you are rewarded with a spectacular view of the Missouri River valley.",
   "The climb is pretty easy and short with a beautiful view at the top.",
   "The difficulty of the trail depends on which entrance you come from. If you are coming from the Katy trail (~6 mile round trip from McBaine), be prepared for a steep uphill climb. If you are coming from Warren School Road, it is a very pleasant, easy walk. The view is fantastic and well worth the trip from either direction. \n\nIt's best to visit this spot in the late fall, winter, and early spring, as it can be a tick haven the rest of the year (the reason why I've rated this trail 4/5 stars). I have also seen the occasional wasp and yellow jacket, so beware! \n\nGood place to have a quick picnic as long as you visit when the bugs aren't too bad."

   "Great place for kids of all ages theres playing areas, picnic areas, trails to walk waters to fish in.",
   "The playground is excellent. That's not why we were there but I would definitely take my kid there. We were there to watch the sunset and discovered that there was a beautiful pond with a paved path all the way around. It was lovely to sit and watch the sunset, and we would have stayed longer if I had remembered the bug spray.",
   "Love the park and it's contours. My kids and  I enjoy it a lot.",
   "Columbia Missouri boast several fantastic city parks and this is certainly one of them. Beautiful views on the easy hike around the pond. The path is paved so eventhough it had been raining our walk was pleasant and not muddy.  The kids were enjoying the large playground as we devoured our dessert in one of the shelters on the grounds.",
   "Plenty of kid spaces as well as walking path around the lake. Shelters have bbq pits and there is a nice sand area for volleyball. Main downside is distance to restrooms and the usual metal Park toilets"

   "We started our 2 1/2 hour road trip in Alba, MO and ended up here at the amazing Ha Ha Tonka State Park. I originally only cared about seeing the castle remains, but found the Natural Bridge absolutely stunning. Unfortunately rain was on the way and my ankle was not cooperating. We only got to see a tiny bit of this EPIC park and now i plan to come back soon and be prepared with backpacks, snacks and proper hiking attire. It's so huge, one of the trails will take over 6 hours to hike! I can't wait to mark that off my bucket list! Best of all, FREE!",
   "Yesterday was a great day to visit this amazing natural wonder. And we were extra blessed, to find that the waterfall over the backside of the Natural Bridge was flowing due to the recent rain. I highly recommend this park for anyone waiting to take in Nature's Beauty, but if you can catch it after a rain and catch that waterfall, it was just breathtaking. Also, we had the chance to visit with a couple of the park rangers that were super nice.",
   "A beautiful state park that is part of what the Lake of the Ozarks is known for! Go see a burnt down castle, check out a serene natural spring, hike a collection of different trails, climb hundreds of merciless steps, i love it all! They also have covered areas for eating lunch and some with playgrounds for teh kids. If you want some more thorough and interesting information on the park visit  the visitors center located at the entrance of the park. Worth a trip, good FREE all day fun!",
   "This area is beautiful and there is so much to see. The staff was very nice and helpful as well. Definitely plan on spending an hour or two here.",
   "Awesome place to walk and sight see. Things like this.. NaTuRaL undisturbed beauty are abundant in Missouri . Come see Us here and we'll live up to the famed name and \"Show you what the Show-Me State is all about . \""

   "The cave was very cool. I didn't give it 5 stars because the tour guide seemed a little less than happy to be there and the souvenir shop didn't have much stuff that was actually from the cave or made locally, which was disappointing. But seeing it was a neat experience. It was definitely chilly and I would recommend a sweater but you could make it without. I wore sandals and I was fine but the floor is a bit wet and there is dripping water so I would recommend tennis shoes. Definitely interesting and a fun memory.",
   "Very knowledgeable staff and an awesome tour. Lots to learn and see. My kids loved it, and so did we.",
   "I had the good fortune to stumble upon Jacob\u2019s Cave on a Google search ahead of a trip to Missouri. I got there right when they opened so I was able to get a one on one tour with a young woman whose family owns and operates the cave. Even though the cave is millions of years old, it is very much an active system, with an incredible diversity of geologic structures being created right before your very eyes, with water snaking its way through every nook and cranny of the cave system, almost giving the illusion that the system itself is alive. I\u2019ve been in several different caves at this point across Missouri and Kentucky and this one was one of the most fascinating, due to the completely unique combination of various formations. The tour itself was interesting and engaging the whole time, with the guide knowing all about the history of the cave, the geology that created it, and various other observations that made it a unique and rewarding experience all around. If you\u2019re remotely near this part of Missouri, I highly suggest you drop by and take the tour, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",
   "This was a great experience with my family.  Our tour guide made it especially fun and interesting. We went during spring break, which I understand to be kind of the off season; so no wait and a private tour for the five of us. Remember to bring your phone or camera in to take pics and video clips.",
   "A cool place with all kinds of neat features to tour! There was a nice path to follow into the cave, it was close to 1/2 a mile deep into the rock, & the guide was very knowledgeable while providing a fun tour"

   "While this is a beautiful area, the park is really not for me, as I visit state parks to commune with nature, and this is one of Missouri's two state parks which allow ATVs. I don't want to hear the roar of those engines as they whiz past me! If you don't mind the noise, the park does have a lot to offer,, such as a campground (with a playground), and opportunities for a variety of other activities, including boating (electric motors only), canoeing, kayaking, swimming, fishing, picnicking, hiking, mountain biking, and metal detecting.\nThe park has an interesting history, as the area was once known as Peabody Coal Company's Mark Twain Mine (1964- 1967). The company donated the land to the State in 1974, for use as a park. We really enjoyed the scenery, the noise, not so much.",
   "There's more to do than riding off-road vehicles. Canoe ($25/day) and kayak ($15.90@2hr) rentals, mountain bike trails, swimming, and beautiful picnic sites. Stayed in early September through the week with only one other camper here. A couple off road vehicles were at the park but not heard from at camp site 16. The park attractions are a distance apart, camp sites are large, clean bathrooms and showers and an organized and helpful park office. I've been to most Missouri state park campgrounds and this modern, well-maintained park has to be one of my favorites.",
   "I grew up going to finger lakes and Rocky Fork! There's just about anything outside you want to do here. This is a great place for camping Motocross fishing they have a firing range at Rocky Fork. And there's times when I actually go out here and do nothing more than just walk off into the woods and have some peaceful time to myself and the best part is it's really not that far out of the city so I don't have to travel long distances to go out and enjoy nature without having a whole mess of people around me destroying but I'm trying to enjoy!",
   "One of my favorite State Parks. One of the few State Park where you can ride ATV'S. The park has quite a few trails to ride and explore. The park has a very nice shooting range with a dedicated pigeon shooting area. Also has a lake though it's fairly small and the swimming beach isn't much. Things to know $5 per person to ride if you're a Missouri resident.  You need a helmet and a flag on the bike. No passengers unless your bike is designed for one. Area does have a loading/unloading dock.",
   "The state takes 5 star care of the park. It\u2019s a great resource. I give it 4 stars because sometimes idiots go out there and have no idea of gun safety. We leave then. We don\u2019t use the make or the 4 wheel park."

Not to mention how gorgeous the cave is.",

Even a creek running through with their own covered bridge. plenty of play ground equipment, with the major bonus of being wheel chair or stroller accessible. Several bathrooms, drinking fountains, and many shelters. They also provide bags for little bins for those people who forget to bring along a sack to clean up after their pets. Every summer one of the biggest draws is the pool with the water slide, only maybe 5ft deep it's made for the smaller children/families the teens usually end up across town at liberty. They also have a lift to help people with disabilities in and out of the pool.",

   "Pretty neat little place. Definitely worth the $6. Great for small children and enough things to keep the parents entertained for a while as well. Don't forget to save some of your feed for the goats in the back"

   "Amazing tour, shop, set-up, caves, everything overall. The biggest perk is for those traveling with a furry, four legged family members. The have large, outdoor, dog kennels that you can use. You'll put a deposit down on a padlock with key, that you'll use to put your pooch in, while you're on the cave tour. Take a water bowl and water in case it's hot. The tour is unique and is both educational and entertaining. Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed!",
   "Awesome Tour with great tour guide. Beautiful gift shop. A lovely area to visit with many attractions for families. Would love to return in the summer! Thank you!",
   "Cool place!  Awesome views on the river. Nice gift shop! Zip line over the river, take a cave tour, canoe the river. On site camp grounds or a small hotel all in one location.",
   "Beautiful place to visit .it's a guide tour and if you go in big group like 15 people or above you will get some discounts tickets . Beautiful light and sound show and a mother in law's tongue \ud83d\ude1ctoo. Fall they do science exhibits best for school field trips. If few places I felt it is good for Wedding photo shoots too. Other activities are there around this place. Camping area,boating,zipline etc. Restrooms are clean and beautiful staff is helpful. Food area is also available.",

   "I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere was great. Cool concept and cool building. The service was average at best. The food we had was below average. The drinks were good although. Seems to be parking on the street, fun place to come. Just hope for a better food and service experience next time!",
   "The beer was okay... we attempted to try new beer twice however we kept getting the same beer we previously ordered. The pizza could have been great however it was literally cheese with bbq sauce and barely any chicken. The onion rings were great and the atmosphere was cool. All together this place has potential but needs some work.",
   "Was anxious to try this place.  Have heard good things and tried to go a couple times before but it was too busy to get in.  Went today (Sunday) and got right in for lunch early (around 11am).  The place was not busy at all.  Drinks and food order right away and then we waited....around an hour and 15 minutes for sandwiches and fries.  I ordered a reuben and I attached a photo below.  Everything on the plate was cold.  There was one piece of corned beef on the sandwich.  Toward the side where it looks like more the one piece it was folded to fit on the sandwich.  Servers were completely unapologetic about the wait.  In fact I am not sure who our server was because it looked like they kept trading off.  All that being said we won't be back.",
   "Absolutely awesome meal!  We had the cheese and bread appetizer.  To be clear, it's cube cheese (pepper jack, cheddar and swiss).  It was so good, I took the leftovers home.  Additionally, we ordered the grilled chicken and bacon sandwich and ruben, both with fries.  We would order both again!  They even have great sweet tea!  I highly recommend visiting Prison Brews in Jeff City.  The only downside is parking, but I'm not taking away from the rating for something the business can't control.",

It's always so good and made in house. They prefer cash, so bring it if you can. Keeps their costs and prices low by avoiding card fees."

   "They have a great selection of Missouri wines and the process are very reasonable. The people are very knowledgeable and can help you find a wine that you would like. They also will let you sample their wines so you can make sure you like what you are planning on purchasing. They offer 28 different varieties on an everyday basis and then they also have seasonal wines that they offer on a limited basis. They also offer tours of the winery as well, which is informative and a fun experience. It is worth the trip and I look forward to coming back for their seasonal offerings. \n\nAlso, they have a wine club that is only quarterly and had a good discount on other purchases as well. You don't have to come to join, you can sign up online, but I recommend coming for the experience and to taste their selection.",
   "Had a wonderful time at the Winery today. I wanted to take my wife here for date night & it did not disappoint. When we first arrived, we were nicely greeted by Sherry. I asked about the tour & Sherry said that she was available to take us on it. She did a great job explaining the history of the winery & their wines. After we were done with the tour, Sherry served as our server and provided us with some great samples that we chose. By the end of the night, we ended up buying 7 bottles & we couldn't be happier. Thank you Sherry for being such a great host. We will definitely come back to the winery when we need more wine.",
   "Always a great stopping place to enjoy wine while on route to Joplin or to St Louis. Lovely store and wine tasting station. Restful and enjoyable...try it!",
   "Beautiful and professional atmosphere with a friendly staff ready to help. Wine tasting before you buy. Lots of other homemade and local products to buy.",
   "To me St. James makes the best wines anywhere. I love a sweet wine and they have it perfected. We lived in California were I found it very difficult to find a sweet wine anywhere.  We also lived in Virginia were they make some pretty good sweet wines. St. James has mastered the art of sweet wine making. I also suggest joining their wine club to get great discounts on wine shipped directly to my home."

   "Best inside water park! Has everything you dreamed of! Not expensive either!",
   "This place was fun! BUT so overpriced! For 4 people not staying in a hotel it costs 100 dollars. There was a hot tub, play thing for the kids, a small lazy river, 2 slides, a concession stand, and a VERY small pool with some baskets. I just feel like there needs to be more things to do. Maybe some more slides, baby pool for the toddlers, floaty rental, etc. I just wish I could have had more fun there. But some positivity in the review, the 2 water slides were very fun. 1 body slide and 1 raft slide. And another thing... if you want to watch your child and not swim or participate, you have to pay $5! Very disappointed with the results of today but, I gave 2 stars because of the slides and a few fun times and memories I had at the beginning.",
   "Loved this place",
   "$17 for hotel guests to swim, $5 for observers.  Cafe on site.  No lifeguards on duty for the lazy river which gets kind of chaotic with people jumping and running in the river area.   Water slides are great.",
   "My grown daughter fell the second day we were there, the area where she fell was terrible slick.  I told the manager, who wasn't old enough to manage that responsibility she had fallen.  He never asked if she needed medical care or that he was even concerned that she fell!  The fall broke both knees open, no bandaids were offered, she could no longer swim due to an open wound.  The Kid Manager didn't care!  We won't be back!"

   "We love this place. I have literally been taking my sons here for 20+ years. They keep it looking fresh.",
   "A small but well run water park, Big Surf continues to have one of the best wave pools within two hours of central Missouri. Though it's rides tend to be a little more relaxed / smaller than the larger parks, the lines tend to be shorter and go quickly, the food options are good for a small park, and the food prices tend to be a bit more reasonable. \nThere are five main slides, with one being fairly intense / a sharp drop at the beginning, ranging to more mild slides (not including a lazy river). Three of the main slides don't need a tube and three do. \nThe Space Bowl is probably the best non-inner tube ride, though it's easy to get stuck at the beginning due to the initial lack of incline. The last drop / space bowl portion is the fun part.\nThe cliff-like tube ride (I forgot the formal name, some call it \"the banana\") is definitely the most intense ride in the park, with a steep drop of about three stories.\nWorth making a day out of with friends, family, or a youth group. Been twice. Good experience both times now.",
   "Overall, the park was great. The kids had fun. Cabanas are nice but don't offer any real privacy.  Food was overpriced and mediocre, but honestly, the kids loved it.  I just wish there was a few adult options.  \n\nPark and water was clean. Staff were super courteous and helpful.  Going back in a few weeks. Totally a hit.",

   "I just stayed at the hotel and I was amazing. the only reason I give it 4 stars is on the toilet there were pee stances on the part for sitting. and I think that the bathroom of a hotel is what needs to be the cleanest. Just my opinion.",

Many shops filled with touristy things from snow globes to postcards. All rides are extremely fun, but lines can be extremely long depending on what day you come, with Saturdays being extreme in warmer weather. If you come during the summer, the water park is also extremely fun with really fun rides. Tickets aren't too cheap, but you can buy a season pass for not too much more than a ticket. If you plan on going more than twice a year, you should buy a season pass or membership; otherwise, you're good to just go for a ticket. Along with the season pass, the dining pass is a must have. The website goes into better details on the different versions.",
   "This is a very nice facility.  Most of the staff is friendly, and there are a wide variety of things to do around the park.  I just wish there was more shade for when there was hot days but it's not a big concern considering you can just walk in to many of the different places that you can eat.  Speaking of the eateries the food is good everywhere that I have went to eat.  Overall, it is always a fun experience.",

So my review is based on my experience for the one class. There were about 10 people total including myself that showed up for the noon class. So it wasn't overly crowded and i was welcomed right away by all the students. Everyone i met treated me like family! I was really impressed with Coach Kirsten and how detail oriented her instruction was.. She really knows her Jiu Jitsu! The gym itself has a nice lay out, none of the equipment was torn up, the mats felt brand new! A very clean facility and very professional! I plan to train here again, next time I'm in the area!",
   "Gracie Barra Jefferson City is the place to go if you\u2019re looking for a family friendly environment and high level BJJ instructors. Drop by for a free trial class and I\u2019m sure you will fall in love for the gentle art. Amazing self defense program for women\u2019s and anti-bullying for kids.",
   "As a former wrestler from MANY years ago, I\u2019ve missed the brotherhood and family of working hard together to get better on and off the mats. This place more than fills that void. This is my home away from home, and these people are my family.",
   "This has quickly become a very special place to our family. The staff is absolutely phenomenal! Each class is engaging and has value. If you're on the fence about doing it or having a child try it, give it a shot! You owe yourself the opportunity to experience how professional and great this place is!!!",

The cellar tours and samples do have a cut off time, so plan accordingly. You can dine here and listen to live entertainment.",

We took the free tour through the cellars and it was very interesting and informative. Jani (I hope I got that right) was our guide and I really enjoyed the history she shared with us, it was the best wine tour we have ever had. The cellars were amazing! Then we went into the barn for dinner and it did NOT disappoint! You can sit in a horse stall and order authentic German food here. The staff were friendly and kept our glasses full. The food came out pretty quickly and tasted great! We have lived in 8 states, been to 48 states, and visited several wineries. This by far was the most unique, beautiful, and historic winery so far. Everything was excellent and we absolutely loved our afternoon spent here. Will definitely be back for sure!",

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and will proudly talk about the awards taken by Stone Hill\u2019s wines at state and national competitions. We bought a bottle of 2013 Norton and enjoyed it outside at one of the many picnic tables around the grounds. There are two large tasting rooms, and despite two tour buses full of visitors on hand, we were able to belly up for a tasting without waiting. There is a restaurant on site but we did not try it. You can definitely plan to spend a whole afternoon or evening here.",
   "This place is a must see in Hermann! The tour is excellent and the tasting rooms were very quaint. The wines are really good! Selection is excellent. Property and view is amazing"

   "The Grand Cafe is a eclectic place for casual dining in the heart of the Capitol City, Jefferson City, Missouri.  The menu offered a good array of options from which to choose.  I ordered the BLT Wrap with the House Fries.  My partner ordered the Cubano Panini with the House Fries.  Both of us felt the fries were okay, but not warm enough to taste and lacked a crispness and saltiness one might expect of a higher quality French Fry.   The service was exceptionally good, and yet we did not learn the Server\u2019s name until we saw it on the check.\n\nI ordered the Gooey Butter Chocolate Brownie with a side scoop of vanilla ice cream.  It was not only beautifully plated and presented, but delicious AND expensive.  Be certain you inquire about the prices of desserts BEFORE you order as mine was as much as what I ordered for lunch.   It was ample, but not of such quality that warranted the price.  \n\nOverall, this is a good, casual dining location in the State Capitol.  Seating was comfortable, and the dining area clean.   They may want to consider refinishing the metal ceiling as while it is distressed painting, it may appear to some dining customers to be peeling paint.\n\nParking on Saturday was not bad, but go early.",
   "ENJOY\nWe came in and were greeted immediately. I love that everyone is pleasant and happy we are here. Smiles are nice. This is an upscale dining experience for sure. Prices are a little extravagant but you're also paying for class an ambience as well. Every once in a while we deserve to splurge. \nWe had the Cobb salad and the southwest panini w/chips\nThey were very delicious! \nOur service was excellent!\nI would definitely return",
   "One of the top restaurants in Jefferson City, this is the place to go if you have visitors to impress. Great location in the heart of downtown. They have unique dining options and a great cozy atmosphere. Full service bar and outdoor dining is also offered. Highly recommended!",
   "The Grand was probably our first love in Jeff City! From business meetings to date nights, we usually will always end up at the Grand for some portion of the night. The specials are always extra delicious and the jalape\u00f1o margarita from Kevin is a must try. \n\n",
   "Food is delicious. Craft cocktails. Service wasn't bad but not the best I've ever had. Otherwise, would've given 5 stars. Iced coffee cocktail pictured. Highly recommend beet salad. Cuban panini was really good."

   "The best restaurant I\u2019ve ever eaten that was right here. The food is so delicious and it doesn\u2019t matter what you order because everything is made so freshly some from scratch and it\u2019s just an amazing place to go. The staff members that work there are so nice and polite and kind and you can actually have a real conversation with them. To me Madison\u2018s is a more family bond restaurant. Some of staff that works there has worked there for years even some of them have been there for decades. Madison Cafe is a miniature Raniand Italian restaurant and it\u2019s the best one in town. So if you\u2019ve never been there I would highly recommend you going there and I guarantee you once you\u2019ve been there you will definitely become a regular customer.\n I personally love the fettuccine Alfredo with angel hair pasta that I actually Request them to make it that way for me and they do and it\u2019s no problem no extra charge.. \nI would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!!! Believe me it\u2019s worth it!!!!\nIf you want to go out for a romantic night go there.\nIf you just want to go out and have a few drinks and some appetizers with girlfriends or work buddies are just friends go there.\nNo matter what just go there you\u2019re gonna love it as much as I do\u2764\ufe0f",
   "Authentic. Upscale but won't break the bank either.  I recommend making a reservation if you plan to eat after 6 pm.",
   "Italian-themed restaurant in downtown Jefferson City offers various meat and pasta dishes, as well as fish-based & some vegetarian options. Service was excellent! The atmosphere was warm & friendly. Food was pretty good, although I thought some of it was a bit salty. (Then again, I don't consume a lot of salt.) Lots of street parking, easy to find. The restaurant space is accessible for most folks, though the front door looks a bit tricky. Family friendly. The bread baskets = carb crack, and arguably the best thing I consumed. I dipped mine in the parmesan garlic olive oil side. I would definitely eat there again.\n\nAdditionally: I was there for a work event. It's a great venue for working dinners & group presentations.",
   "She put a group of 4 on the list before is and we were there first. Then they seated them and another group of 4 that came in after them we were still waiting the NBA couple cam they were put on the list and you guessed it WE WERE STILL NOT SEATED AFTER 20 MIN AND BEFORE WE WE BY PASSED FOR A FOURTH TIME WE\n LEFT.  I SURE HOPE ROB READS THIS.they dint deserve even 1 star after the way we were treated tonight VELMA",
   "I tell all my friends and family who live in other states and come to visit me here in Jefferson City that Madison\u2019s is a Jefferson City tradition. The attentive and hard working staff help to accentuate the delicious food. \n\nFrom the delicious salads and Appetizers to the succulent and romantic Ch\u00e2teaubriand for two. The food here is a conversation that will be had by families for years to come."

   "We LOVE Sweet Smoke and always have a hard time deciding what to order, even our kids eat their whole tray. It\u2019s amazing how quickly you can order and receive your super fresh food even over their very busy lunch hours. So delicious!\n\n",
   "Decent barbecue and friendly staff. The parking was nice (mall parking lot).  The restaurant was clean with plenty of seating.  The price was fair for the amount of food you get.  Overall I would recommend this place to anyone wanting good bbq",
   "For a local barbecue place it was pretty good. The staff was friendly and plenty of parking by the mall.  Once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes.  Overall the food was good and not overly smoked. The sweet KC barbecue sauce was pretty legit. My overall experience was pretty good and I would recommend anyone to visit",
   "What a gem! Our first time was great.\nOld fashioned stand in line and staff brings it to your table. Clean, big portions, a sauce for all tastes, Family friendly AND... What a welcome surprise...a pretty comprehensive bar.\nWe'll go again.\nThey've got it right!!!",
   "Absolutely excellent. The burnt ends (at lunch, usually gone by not long after 11:30am) and the slop sandwich definitely rise to the top for me. My wife loves the pulled pork nachos. Top side is definitely the pit beans. A must try. A note on the jalapeno cheese grits, these are usually a favorite for me at most places that have them. Here, I found them to be too liquidy, and not quite what I wanted on the flavor profile either, but still fine. \n\nAll around, this is in my top 10 all-time BBQ places for sure. Maybe not top 5, but definitely top 10. Absolutely the best anywhere between KC and STL for sure. Always worth a stop. Great beers on tap too, and a cool atmosphere. Plus, and this is important on workday lunches, they are quick! Very fantastic, keep up the great work, y'all!"

   "Very informal restaurant right across from the State Capitol. Very convenient for us after touring Jefferson City, but I I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. It has Greek-style salads and sandwiches; pizza and pasta. I had the Greek salad, which was very good. My wife had pizza, which was OK, not great; it lacked enough sauce and the thin crust was tough.",
   "Second time I've eaten here. Pizza is very good. Nice atmosphere. Feels like a family diner. This time I had the meatball sandwich along with the salad bar. Also very good. If I had any negatives it would be the salad bar shuts down a little early. There is a small bar off to the side of the dining room which is also kind of small. I can see where this place could get crowded. A Greek flair with a menu that offers something for everyone.",
   "Wow. I needed a nice place like this. Great food. Literally such a wonderful crispy pizza. I got the gyro meat on it which was a nice touch.",
   "Gyros, pizza and all were awesome!! We got seated right away and wait staff was nice. I even bought something for my mom who is not fond of gyros but she liked it! Think I'll be bringing her there someday!"

Burger was juicy, perfectly seasoned, lots of mushroom and Swiss. My siblings were all pretty happy with their food, as well. My daughter.did not like her kids burger. We tried it after she refused to eat it. Very bland, absolutely no seasoning, and I couldn't blame her for no wanting to eat it. \n\nOverall, will definitely be back the next time we are in Jeff City. We might request some seasoning for the kids burger, though!",

   "I've lived in the Jefferson City area most of my adult life, now. I have made it my home. Even so, I've only eaten at Domenico's twice. It isn't a formal experience, but it feels like it should be.  \nThe food is just that good!\nWhen you first walk in, you're in a very relaxed room. There's a bar, with a TV at each end, but last night the bartender's family was there for dinner,   and he's got the cutest little two year old!\nMy friend ordered the cheese tortellini with vegetables, I ordered the chicken Alexander, and we ordered baked goat cheese for an appetizer. We both stuck with water to drink.\nI have NEVER had bad food from Domenico's. My chicken Alexander was a breast piece perfectly cooked, served in a creamy white wine sauce, and under broccoli, mushrooms, onions, and peppers. The baked goat cheese was served with crisp, crusty bread. It was baked in a bowl of marinara sauce. \nLike I said, I have NEVER had bad food food from Domenico's Italian Restaurant.",
   "Really enjoyed this location. The food was excellent. WHERE'S THE OPTION FOR A 6TH STAR? Anyway. Very prompt, courteous and respectful staff. Glad we saw this restaurant. I would recommend  this location for a more enjoyable dining experience. Your restaurant has a great vibe and format. Keep up the good work!!",
   "We were in area for conference..Excellent food we ordered oysters baked crab cakes steak veal. It was excellent. Best food in Jeff city huge menu..we came from Kansas City will make trip for dinner with group...can\u2019t wait to return.. !!!! Must try. R from KC",
   "The first thing I noticed was the restaurant was hard to see from the main road. It was situated at the back of a retail strip mall. The set-up was nice. The restroom was magnificent. It was extremely clean and it smelled wonderful. The entire front of the restaurant was clean!\n\nI ordered seafood ravioli. It was warm, rich, and exquisite. I also had a side order of vegetables. They were seasoned, crisp, and succulent. My colleague had the King Crab and she truly enjoyed it. My only concern was our server. She could have been more attentive .",
   "Food, service, atmosphere, mostly top-notch! We had a positive experience and I would definitely eat here again. It was a little pricey and the side of broccoli I had was a little off tasting, but that could have totally been a fluke. If you are in town or nearby I recommend making a stop and trying the place out for yourself. Next time I pay a visit I\u2019ll try a few other menu items and see if I need to award that fifth star. Lastly, the drinks we ordered were pretty strong so that was another plus."

It just feels like the kind of place that's been around for decades and the food improves with each decade.\n\nThis is the most authentic German food in the area and maybe even more so than places in Hermann, MO.  It's about the experience and the owner/cook makes sure of that from beginning of meal to end.\n\nMy wife and I have enjoyed everything we've tried here so far.\n\nMust try desserts are the Bananas Foster and the Cherry Jubilee."

   "The hand-breaded shrimp were very good and substantial in size--the batter was a bit darker than I like. My only other issue is that the salad had too many stems, but was otherwise good; the homemade Thousand Island was very good.If you orders dessert, the brownie with ice cream is a good choice. Service was a tad slow, but efficient and friendly.",
   "All I can say about this place is that it's AMAZING!!!",
   "This was a meal that will not soon be forgotten.  It was our first visit and I'm positive it will turn out to be the first of many.  The food was absolutely sublime.  The service was professional, attentive, and friendly.  The decor was classy and the atmosphere was intimate.  I very highly recommend that you make a point of giving O'Donoghue's a try.  You will not regret it.",
   "Went with a large group. Gratuity was not inclined which was nice. The food was awesome. They had good gluten free options",

My New Orleans shrimp pasta was delicious, very flavorful but not spicy. My husband's steak was cooked to perfection. We haven't been here in a number of years but will definitely be back very soon!",

   "Outstanding! Great food and amazing service by Janelle! Will definitely be back. Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates exceptional food!",
   "A high-class Place, good for celebration such as birthdays and graduations, but also great just for impressing a date. The food is excellent, and if anything is not right they will make it right for you. The wait staff is well trained and you never have to wait for someone to fill your glass. The atmosphere is excellent. If you like lobster tail they have a wonderful fried lobster tail that will make your mouth orgasm"

   "Been here twice and each time the food has been amazing.  Delicious chicken and waffles, and the surf (minus the turf) burrito of the week was almost to die for (almost as I live to tell the tale!)  ;)  The restaurant is new and chic.  My partner was thoroughly impressed with the plywood flooring.  There is local art adorning the walls, some of which you can purchase if you are interested.  Always clean!!!!  One cannot say that about every eatery anywhere.  Always a seat available, even when they're busy, and the service is top notch and quick.  If you have not visited you are missing out on one of JC's newest and best eateries in town!",
   "Food was fantastic. Owner is awesome. The chili was one of the best I have ever had. Spicy, flavorful and filling.",
   "This is the best breakfast (and they\u2019re open through lunch too) in Jefferson City! Flavor perfection. Awesome variety of breakfast burritos or bowls. Your taste buds will thank you!\nMy favorite is the house made chicken chorizo.",
   "Freaking amazing. Pretty unique restaurant idea. Started out as a restaurant until it collapsed, turned into a food truck until a tornado took it out, now is a cute little spot downtown. \n\nThe green chili one is phenomenal. No matter what skip the salsa and go with the aioli on it. \n\nOwners are incredibly nice and super passionate about  their craft as well. \n\nThey do a few lunch specials and I hope they get more once they get settled in! \n\nGood stuff.",
   "Really good burritos and amazing variety.  I've had 5 different burritos so far, and have yet to be disappointed.  My favorite so far is the chicken chorizo burrito.  Make sure you get the spicy aioli - it's really good."

   "I happened to go at the right time - shortly after 6pm. Food was fresh and there was plenty of it. The food was good. However, the service was lacking. They seemed eager to refill water but not soda. The drinks with all the ice barely hold 8oz of beverage. Their dinner theater was relatively \"amateur,\" as small children kept running in and out of the kitchen, who knows I guess they could have been on break. Worse yet, one of the urchins had a drink cup bigger than mine. I took pity on him though, for his was empty and I assume it was his playtime/break after all.",
   "Very friendly greeters and waiters, the food was hot and fresh, delicious and tasty array of choices to eat. Fresh vegetables grilled and baked and fried protein to meet the needs of even the pickiest eaters. My family and I would definitely patronize this establishment over and over again. One of the most friendliest cleanest and tastiest Chinese restaurants in town."

You can know what I mean by presentation by looking at the stakes in the picture; That\u2019s how plates were served. \n\nThe t-bone was ordered medium-rare, but it was well-done.. both orders were a little bit over cooked. \n\nAfter bringing the check and signing it, the waiter took it before we leave. That\u2019s rude and definitely not professional. The norm is not to collect the signed receipt until after the customer leaves.",

Excellent service for a chain restaurant.  I would recommend this establishment and patronize the steakhouse again.",

In Jeff City, there is a void for healthy/clean eating. Love 2 Nourish changed the game for me in a dramatic way. Their food is always delicious with great portion sizes, reasonably priced, and so convenient. They deliver the meals straight to your door.\n\nLaurel is honestly a saint and provides the best service. Every email I ever send is responded to personally.

On the day of the wedding, the Lutz's team was welcoming, helpful, and flexible. I thoroughly enjoyed their energy, and it was great to have them enhance the guest experience.

Grab a table, get a plate and drink, and pay at the register when you are finished.  Pretty much self serve during lunch. The only challenge you might have is navigating the lines between the waves of people getting in line for fresh pizza as it comes up.   They have changed the layout of the dinning area a little to accommodate more people so finding a table seems to be a little easier.  If you have large groups give them a call, they might be able to work you into a private area down stairs."

So once again we are here today. Thanks for providing a great dining experience every time.",
   "I guess we lucked out that it wasn't crowded on a Friday night. Great service, and they have hooks under the table for a purse! (#thelittlethings) \nWe tried the Mad Rooster pizza and it was pretty good. It's not what we'd usually get but it's quite spicy. The crust actually reminds me of a breakfast pizza crust and the garlic cream sauce was delicious. The wine was so good but overpriced. I can buy it here locally for the price they'd charge for two small glasses.",
   "This is a great place to go for lunch. The food was fresh and delicious. The service was excellent and very friendly."

My salad was fresh and I love that I can get whatever vegetables I want in it. I gave 4 stars because I've been there before and had a couple of issues with burnt pizza and incorrect orders.",
   "1st time I have tried the cauliflower crust. And 1st time I have ever been able to build my own without a large upcharge.\nBEST PIZZA EVER!!!\nEven had roasted garlic pieces!!!!",
   "Love this place. Always great service. Fast and delicious. Every time I come in, they are freindly and fast. Never had a bad experience here.",
   "It was my first time, and it was a success.  Design your own pizza, who doesn't love that?  There were lots of toppings from which to chose.  The staff was helpful and the place was clean. The price was good.  I would come back.",
   "I love MOD pizza. It is refreshing to be able to design your own special pizza without paying extra for toppings. Always delicious and the staff are always friendly and helpful. The only reason this restaurant does not get 5 \u2b50\ufe0frating is the volume of the music they play. Another new restaurant where the music is so loud you can\u2019t carry on a conversation. ( Must be for people who just want to play on their phones.) We usually get ours to go for just this reason. But the pizza is great!"

But the skirt burger is fun! Tenderloin is huge! Thursday night is trivia... I think they are still trying to grow a following for this as there were only 3 teams, but the questions were a very good mix and it was a lot of fun. I hope they continue to do that. Definitely one of our \"go to\" spots in Jeff City!",

   "The staff is super friendly here. The drinks came out quick and we had a great time playing pool here. The food was tasty too.",
   "Great place, good atmosphere. Wonderful place to throw darts. Sidenote, they don't have a very good alternative menu. No keto/Gluten free options that I saw on the menu.",
   "Open seating bar and grill with a solid burger. Macrobrew selection with a small craft selection in cans, plus large liquor offering. Mature crowd, friendly staff. Great place to grab a beer, burger, and conversation. 2 pool tables and shuffleboard, plus live bands on occasion."

   "Great Irish Pub restaurant with indoor seating at tables, booths, or bar, & outdoor seating at covered deck. \n\nGood menu with ginormous portions of food.  The pork loin sandwich was ridiculous and delicious.  The cheese steak sandwich was amazing.  The Magner\u2019s hard cider was tasty.\n\nCan\u2019t find food like this anywhere else in town.\n\nFriendly service.\n\nSeems like it\u2019s always busy, but we got immediate seating.\n\nStreet parking in front or along side street.",
   "Food is phenomenal. The cheese steak soup is some of the best soup I\u2019ve ever had. Burgers are amazing! Chips and cheese are soooooo good and big enough to share. Guinness beer is one of the best pours you\u2019ll find in the US. Chicken strips are handed-breaded. Be prepared for a wait and less that stellar service - but it is *so* worth it.",

   "Jeff City is sooooo lucky to have JQ\u2019s, never a bad experience. Everything is so fresh and the quaint atmosphere just adds to the whole experience. It helps with the lunch staff just knows your order. We LOVE JQ\u2019s!\n\n",
   "I'm surprised I've never eaten here before, and if anyone has told me about it, I must not have been listening.  A simple menu where the attention to detail is placed on the flavor and preparation of the food.  The staff member that took our order was very helpful and courteous.  Even though this night was rather slow and there were plenty of available seats, we opted to sit next door at The Mission where they had open mic night going on. They walked our order right over and delivered it to our table.  That's pretty cool.  \n\nWe ordered the burger and the fish tacos. The burger was good sized, placed on a toasted bun with onions, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. I also had them add jalapenos.  There was a sauce added on the underside which was flavorful but didnt dominate the taste of the burger.  It was cooked evenly through and the burger itself had good taste and wasn't dried out or overly greasy. \n\nThe fish tacos had a good amount of fish and the tastes and texture worked out great.  Nothing seemed over cooked or lacking seasoning. \n\nIf your like supporting your local businesses and like your food cooked to order, you should deffinitly try it.",
   "This is a great burger joint and more! I have enjoyed talking with the owners as much as having their burgers too! I want to try everything on the menu at least once but it's hard to move past those big, juicy, wonderful tasting chopped brisket works of art!",
   "Food was great especially the baked beans. They were an upcharge though. My grandson  took me there he loves the burgers. They were pricey but well worth it. Staff was awesome.  Will go again for sure"

Both times my drink had been spilled a bit inside the bag. Who puts the drinks in the bag, and why? Both times our appetizers were wrapped with paper towels, which gets soggy and becomes glued to the pot stickers, dumplings or whatever. Unless   I'm desperate for Thai, I dont think I'll buy from them again.",

I'm giving 2 stars only due to their lack of consideration toward customers health. \nWhile dining, they proceeded in sweeping floors within very close proximity of customers tables. I'm confident that state health department laws and regulations would consider this a health violation. Have they no knowledge of the dust and airborne pathogens they cause to be stirred and distributed. \nFood, service, quality and quantities were proportionate, with the food being tasteful and fresh, just hope they review customer reviews and make the necessary changes toward customers safety.",

I know because he didn\u2019t even put the phone on mute. It\u2019s sad that this small community can\u2019t get good consistent customer service. And when concerns about food you ARE PAYING for are brought to managements attentions. They just look at you. Don\u2019t say I apologize, I will speak with blank. Or we will fix for next time. You get nothing but a blank look. And I\u2019ve gotten FOOD POISONING twice from this place. I swore I wouldn\u2019t eat here again. It\u2019s been a year and I thought Let me try it one more time and BOOM Still no change. I hope they read these and do take into consideration peoples feeling because talking to them doesn\u2019t work.",
   "Nice restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. The chips are hot and fresh",
   "Ordered take out of a chicken taco salad and got 20%salad and 80% sour cream when I called to see if I could just get it replaced with chicken nachos something my 2 year old brother could assemble correctly they would not replace it nor help in anyway, and the icing on the cake was I\u2019ve been sitting on the toilet for the past hour think I have food poisoning. Also another time I told a waiter to have a good one and got called a pendeho what ever that means will not return",
   "We went to dinner here on a Saturday night. Place was pretty crowded but still got seated quickly. The waitress got our drink order then. We ordered a short while later then waited an hour for food. When the food came out it was cold. On top of that they forgot to bring my brother in law's food. It was another 15 minutes before we could flag the manager over. They finally bright his food out. It was cold as well.  I do not recommend this place and we will never go back.",
   "Big menu. Great food and service. Place is huge. You could fit half of Jeff City in here."

A very nicely crisp salmon on top of al dente vegetables with a spicy red curry and white rice.  \n\nThe building seems like it was built in an alleyway but don't let the location fool you.

   "I went to this establishment for the first time on Jan 17 2020.  My main reason was to play their bar bingo which by the way is free to play.  It is called extreme bingo.  You have a chance to win a 52 inch TV or $100 gift card.  They even had a game you could win $3000.  All for free.  So I had a some food from there kitchen which I would give 5 stars for.  The staff will get 5 stars plus.  Very friendly and always a step ahead of what I wanted.  Very friendly.  Plenty of seating.  Very wonderful experience.  Now I have a regular Thursday activity.  Nothing but good things to say.  Very nice place and staff.",

   "There's a reason they have the best bartender in town... No really. They literally have the #1 voted bartender, Faith. Want a drink and a great service? Pull a seat downtown with Faith or Pat tell em I sent you. Seriously, tell em. They'll get a kick out of it!",
   "Nice atmosphere and good bands but the service is HORRIBLE.  You have to wait forever to get food and drinks. Not sure if they have waitresses anymore. In past visits they would come to the tables for you to order stuff, now they ignore you until you go to the bar and wait forever for them to serve you.",

   "I got the gyro sandwich, which was was good. However, for $9 I didn't feel like it was worth it. The others in my party said the food was good or so-so, with one person saying their salad was way too salty. The service was very slow, and the waiter wasn't very friendly. And the atmosphere left much to be desired; it didn't feel like they had personalized the restaurant much with artwork or unique music. Overall, I wouldn't be absolutely opposed to going back to Ria's, but I wouldn't seek it out either."

   "My favorite part about going into a Chipotle is that no matter if the line is long or short, the time it takes to get your food is always reasonable. With that being said, the only way this is achieved is if everyone cohesively works as one unit. This specific Chipotle needs improvement in this area.",

You can get from zero to a hundred and heat intensity index, even at 0 the food is just spectacular. It is Affordable, family-friendly, and the kids will actually really like it. It has a wonderful assortment of appetizers that are simply to die for.  I recommend the potstickers, and my favorite is the jasmine rice with your choice of tofu, chicken, beef, or pork. You can also make a combination of two meats for your meal. They have yet to get my order wrong in all the many years that I've been going to both of their locations in Jefferson City."

   "I was hoping for a bit more from Big Whiskey. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but there certainly wasn't anything to get excited about either. It seems to be pretty popular as the wait was around 45 minutes and it took a while to get our meals, but the food didn't deliver for what I was expecting. \n\nI got the turkey burger and it was pretty boring. Others I've had that have been much better have used some pepper jack, Cajun spices, or guacamole to give it some life, but that definitely  wasn't the case here. \n\nMy daughter's mini shrimp were pretty decent. My other daughter got pasta with alfredo, but the noodles were drowned in sauce and she didn't like it much. My wife seemed to like her salmon pretty well.\n\nI'll give it another shot and try something different, but I'll temper my expectations next time.",
   "We (2 couples) had a good time at Big Whiskeys this past weekend during their Grand Opening. The FOOD and DRINKS were GREAT\u203c\ud83d\ude0a They have a huge drink menu, they were running a special on $5 margaritas, which were very good! Their Whiskey Flights are an awesome way to try out several types of whiskey without spending a fortune. The men both tried the Bourbon Flight, it was a pretty cool presentation, picture attached.  Our waitress was very attentive,\u00a0 even while they were extremely busy. The manager even visited our table to see how everything was and we told him it was great and how much we liked the place.\n\nFor those of you with families wondering about taking the kiddos, they are family friendly, they have TV screens everywhere, the KIDS have their own menu and they even eat FREE on TUESDAY NIGHT'S\u2757\u00a0 \n\nMy friend and I went to the restroom as we were leaving and we were quite surprised. It was very CLEAN, even at midnight, especially after a very busy night. The only suggestion I have on this whole review, is for them to move the paper towel dispenser to the wall by the door. It is just a little awkward where its positioned right now.\n\nI like reading reviews, but I very rarely write one. Since Big Whiskey's is new in town, I felt a review was very important, whether it was GOOD\ud83d\ude00 or bad, just to let other people know. We felt that everything went very smoothly Saturday night and we think Big Whiskey's will be a HUGE HIT in Jefferson City, MO.\ud83d\udc95\n\nPS. For those late-night people out there, they're open from 12- 2 a.m.",
   "Absolutely the most welcoming experience during such trying times. Restauranat was limited to no more than 10 people, yet they let us wait with drinks in hand for available seating. We\u2019d been driving for 450 miles so what a relief. \nSteak was perfect IPA awesome, service super friendly. \nThank you for your hospitality!\nDwight",
   "Really good food. Staff was friendly. Our server was there any time we needed something but wasn't hovering which is nice. The food was tasty. I had the nachos (it's labeled as an appetizer) and a brownie for desert. To be honest I didn't need the brownie because I was stuffed from the nachos. Thankfully when you get the brownie you can request more spoons so you can share! Overall a good experience and no one left hungry. It's a little on the pricey side and if I were a cook there I would season more while I'm cooking but like I said overall it was a win in my book.",
   "I only gave a 4 because the food was pretty good but not exceptional. Our service was great, though! They don't do reservations but they do offer \"call ahead seating\" which basically puts you in a queue and they text you when your table is ready, which worked well for us. Fun place overall and definitely would recommend/return."

   "My niece and I had chili dogs, onion rings and  chocolate milk shakes...the food was warm and delicious. The lady who took our order and brought our food was welcoming and warm like a country restaurant. I wish that I got her name, she totally deserves recognition! She is definitely a keeper!",
   "Use the App. Great deals.",
   "I asked twice for a breaded chicken ranch sandwich I didn't want the grilled chicken he said yes they had it I was waiting in line out in the lobby area and they bring me my food. not on a tray and not in a bag I just bring me the two sandwiches I ordered one of them being wrong there's a grilled chicken instead of breaded chicken and not even a to-go bag there are a bunch of kids just playing in there basically I understand it's Friday night and kids get worked up and and get a bunch of them together but somebody needs to get a grip on that crew for real. The cooks we're talking about it being a Japanese fish sandwich whatever that meant just very unprofessional",
   "Great ice cream, of course. It is a lot pricier than it used to be, but the food is still good! ",
   "I was not pleased with the drive-through service about 4pm yesterday.  The person taking and giving the order seemed to care less.  The food was just shoved out the window without the server saying one word to me.  I got home the fries were cold from being not cooked properly and the burger was old."

   "We had great service and great food! Our hostess was talking to us all the way to our seat, and was so friendly! Then we met our waiter, Will, who was SO enthusiastic and friendly! Even though it was 2 pm on a Saturday it was very busy, but Will was constantly coming by our table to ask how everything was, and to clear plates! I told my daughter that he should do commercials for the restaurant, because he was so knowledgeable about each and every item on the menu! Great service = a great tip! We\u2019ll definitely be back!",
   "Surprisingly good!\n\nI really enjoyed the prime rib.\n\nGreat sides. \n\nDelicious free dinner rolls and bucket of peanuts.\n\nFriendly service. \n\nComfortable seating and pleasant atmosphere. \n\nCan accommodate large groups. \n\nGenerous size waiting area. \n\nThere\u2019s also a bar.\n\nConvenient location. \n\nPlenty of parking.",
   "I have heard wait times can be more than a little on the long side. When I arrived the waiting area was packed. As a party of two the hostess suggested we try the bar if we didn't want to wait for a table.\nWe were seated at the bar and greeted by Jess who has such a warm and bubbly personality she either really loves her job or may need professional help.\nDrinks were prompt and proper. She provided options most other bar tenders don't consider. Refills were spot on. Our bread was delivered quickly, the following courses were delivered exactly when needed.\nI had the Road Kill. The only thing I can say about this dish is that if it was any more tender I would have needed a spoon.\nUntil today I thought Ruby Tuesday had the best steak in town. Sorry Ruby's, your steaks are great but despite the valiant effort you have been dethroned.\nJudging by the others seated around me my experience was not unique. Several steaks were ordered. One gentleman remarked that his baked potato was the best he had ever had.\nAt the end of my meal I was stuffed to the point I thought a crane would be required to remove me.\nPricing is comparable to other steak houses in the area.\nMy advice to make the experience better would be to lower the volume in the restaurant 20% and open for lunch on weekdays. Otherwise, bravo.\nNow, if you will excuse me I need a nap.",
   "First, we had the best server I have ever had anywhere, hands down, Will.  He was very friendly and checked on us just the right amount of times.  This man deserves a raise/promotion.  The food was really good.  The music was a little loud to talk (we had a large group) but we dealt with that.  William received a large tip for his awesome service.....Texas Roadhouse, you better keep this one on staff.)",
   "Great atmosphere, awesome service and fantastic food. I will advise to get there as soon as the doors open (4pm) Monday through Friday (11am) Saturday and Sunday as the place fills up fast but well worth the money and wait. Our server was extremely friendly as was everyone else who worked there, we were greeted by every employee we came in contact with on our way to be seated and also everyone said bye and gave a good night on our way out. It was an awesome place to have a family dinner"

   "The food here is remarkably good, and the lunch specials are very cheap: a big portion of main dish, fried rice, and an egg roll for under $6. I really like the Orange Chicken, and always get the fried rice St. Louis style (just ask, no extra charge). The buffet is good too for its relatively small size. Be prepared for a really odd mix of music they play... it run the gamut from heavy metal to Enya. \ud83d\ude44",
   "Food has a funky aftertaste, food overcooked, barely a selection. This would not pass as a 4 star restaurant anywhere and as a visitor to this city I am sorely disappointed in what passes for a 4 star. This place is a 2 star at best. The food is awful, and there's absolutely no service . 10/10 don't recommend, don't waste your time or money. Better off going to Subway, at least you might be happy with the results.",
   "My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to eat here on a whim. As soon as we walked in, the atmosphere was really cold and dark. The cashier was extremely rude and impatient and acted as if he didn't want to be there. Not a good first impression. Then we walked into what looked like a banquet hall with booth seats just smushed together all over it with horrendous lighting... instead we opted for one of the smaller tables by the buffet. The food wasn't awful but it wasn't fantastic either. We both ordered the sesame chicken combo with crab rangoons. Not bad, but you could tell that it wasn't cooked with care. We probably won't be going back.",
   "Food was not impressive at all. Will not return",
   "Cold food, told this was all they were making at 12:37, rude cashier, small amounts of food to choose from, dirty floors, dirty tables, bathroom is very Grimmie and not enough for a $11.00 buffet for lunch??? I don't think l will be back!?"
