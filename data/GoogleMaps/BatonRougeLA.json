   "Great displays, clean and polite staff, facilities are great and clean restrooms.  If you can get on one of the tours on board, it's extremely informative.  Our group loved the info and historical significance. Kids seemed to like it too and you get to go to most places on the ship and examine everything.",
   "Great museum with well preserved historical artifacts. I really enjoyed how the curators have chosen to display ships of different types to give visitors an idea of how important naval defenses are to national security. Local heroes are highlighted and honored as well. I highly recommend a visit to the museum to anyone!!! If your kids are younger, all about how they and a group of friends can spend the night on the ship.",
   "A wonderful tribute to those who served. The museum was great, highly interactive and well kept. Parking was easy. I could park 10 feet from the door. The gift shop had some very nice things. The memorials to those who died in Vietnam and in many other conflicts was touching and serene. And the battleship was well kept. The tour was top notch because you could go to probably 85% of the ship. There weren\u2019t many rules or ropes preventing you from really getting a scale of the Kidd. The sick bay, the radio room, the guns, the showers and bathrooms, the crew quarters and the various decks of the ship all were kept in really good shape and made for a great tour. If you haven\u2019t been and you\u2019re driving through Baton Rouge, you should absolutely spend a few hours here",
   "Had a great time.  Haven't been here since I was a kid.  My wife had never been and she really enjoyed it.  Didn't realize it but by the time we were almost done looking at the ship 2.5hrs had passed, and we were moving pretty quick.  \nIt's something you can definitely sink some time in to if you try to see everything.  We didn't spend much time taking photos, but there is lots of things to photograph.",
   "Self directed tour. Fascinating look at what it would have been like to serve on a destroyer in WWII. Must not have been an easy experience for those sailors. Worth a look if you are into military stuff and don't mind climbing around in close quarters"

   "This is a wonderful exhibit that shows the actual tiger in his enclosure. It is near the stadium and on campus to that it is easy to get to. There is plenty of parking nearby and it allows lots people to see Mike. It is one of the best places to see a tiger up close. Both times that I stopped by the enclosure, Mike was outside and sitting on the rock making picture taking easy. I think this is a must see for anyone in the area.",
   "We always love seeing Mike the tiger!  He has a wonderful habitat and there are plenty of places around it to help you get a great view of him. My 10 year old took this photo of Mike.\ud83d\ude42",
   "Always fun seeing Mike. Especially since he is a younger version and very spunky. He was extremely playful. He was playing in the water and looking through the glass. He got very up close and personal. We visit here often.",
   "Mike is a good sport. He's the local bengal(?) tiger which is LSU's mascot. He lives in a nice habitat accessible to the public to come admire such a majestic animal. He was up and about and lounged around.  He actually looked at me turning his head 180 degrees when I called him. I was not aware how pointed and chiseled a tiger's head is from it's profile and how round it is when it faces you. Because he is relatively close behind two wire mesh fences you can feel his presence.  If you are in the area drop by, you will enjoy it. The students are scurrying to and from places, however, my daughter asked a young lady to take photos and she was impressively kind and attractive.",
   "Came to see the complete dismantling of Texas A&M and enjoyed every second of seeing Burrow rip through these guys. The Tiger Habitat is amazing, and Tiger Stadium is the place to be on a Fall Saturday night. What an experience. Can't wait to get back."

   "Last April I was in town from Michigan for a week visiting Baton Rouge and I  had a great time visiting the Louisiana Old State Capital. It was a beautiful sight, and I got to learn a lot of history and info about it. I would recommend if you are visiting Baton Rouge that you come check out the Louisiana Old State Capital.",

If you enjoy historic venues, this place is a must-see!I especially like how they will change different venues to make sure that the venue is always fresh."

First floor - history of Louisiana from French time to the modern and exposition covering whole economic diversity of the state and the second floor is abundant presence of the different cultural phenomenas of Louisiana. Different regions, different aspects: from voodoo culture and jazz funeral to Mardi Gras and different variety of music. \n\nSorry for many words, but the place is amazing, must see.",

   "This place is awesome and so pretty. You could hear owls all while walking through the stunning swamp. It was very easy to find and isn\u2019t expensive to visit. However, I\u2019m giving it 3 stars because we wanted to buy something in the nature center and they had already \u201cclosed down the system\u201d even though they were still open for 25 more minutes. So my family, and the 3 other families in there who ALSO wanted to buy something could not do so all because the two girls working the counter wanted to leave right as the center closed. Super annoying. Definitely go visit here, but make sure it\u2019s an hour before they close if you want to buy something.",
   "I was very disappointed with the service Jessica Guthrie, Manager promised during the walk through of the rental facility prior to my daughter-in-law baby shower. When I arrived on site at the facility, their staff member was very unprofessional and rude after I had brought my concerns regarding the uncleanliness of the facility. The floor of the entrance was dirty, the carpet needed vacuum. The tables and chairs was not setup as promised during the walk through. The kitchen had roach eggs and spiders on the counter tops. There were nasty dishes left in the sink with dirty wash sponge. The refrigerator was not clean or cleared out. The bathrooms was not clean. This is suppose to be a place where kids have day camp. If your child go to this place, I would think twice about taking them there. Then the female staff person had the nerve to check me off to see if I cleaned the area before leaving. My crew had to take 30 minutes to clean before setup. In the contract,  I was only given one hour setup time.\n Therefore, we only had 30 minutes to setup, not fair. What\u2019s the purpose of having a hour setup time, if the rental guest have to come in to clean and setup their space. It doesn\u2019t make since to give the guest one hour  setup time when you have not kept your end of the agreement. Also, you need to get rid of that staff member girl that was overseeing 12/29/19, Sunday. She was unprofessional and does not need to be in that position. She gives your company a poor representation. For this reason, I will never rent this facility again.\n\n By the way, let me give you qualities a representative staff member should have: someone that is warm welcoming and inviting with a smile, willing to make sure the guest is satisfied with their space, and helpful in resulting issues that my arrive in a professional manner.",
   "Worth a visit if you live in the area.  Not the beat scenery.  Go to Tickfaw State Park for good trails in a swamp setting.",
   "Great nearby spot to get away from the city vibe. Bring binoculars and a lunch find a bench along the trail and just wait for the scene to unfold. Kinda wierd to see buildings along the library trail but still a great little spot in the woods.",
   "It's a great little hiking trail through a swamp, with wooden walkways for the wet bits. Surprisingly scenic for being in the middle of the city"

   "This is an entertaining spot to visit. The facility is impeccable as were the employees.  Its right smack in the middle of things so you can reach just about everything that you may want in the downtown area. I guess my favorite was the skull of a triceratops which is easily viewable to provide one with the magnitude in size and power this beast once had.",
   "I grew up with the LASM as THE museum school field trips went to. Their children's discovery area was AMAZING! I'll never forget the pulleys and ropes that you could lift yourself up with...those are gone. I remember the satellite dish-looking echo communication devices being farther apart and even more impressive for it. They're not very far any more. I remember fossil stations that made me feel so smart and accomplished. Those are gone too. The planetarium is still pretty great! They show wonderful videos and documentaries that are very informative! I deeply miss the meaningful and physically visual interactions kids used to get from the full discovery area. Something they get a mere FRACTION of at the new, reduced area.",
   "The family took advantage of the Museum being free the first sunday of each month. So we toured the whole thing and had a blast. My 8 year old couldve enjoyed it all day long. My 4 and 6 year olds really like the space exhibits and seeing the MUMMY in egypt exhibit! They didnt allow pics of the mummy sorry. But this not the only free thing downtown Baton Rouge. In feburary we saw USS Kidd free of charge as well. Next month we might check out old state capital. ( not sure how 4 y.o. will enjoy that one)",
   "Fantastic museum and place to spend an entire day.  Lots of reading on the first floor.  The second floor has a fantastic, big, colorful exhibit on the different cultures and customs of the different regions of Louisiana.  Am anxious to return soon!!!",
   "Went with a 4th grade field trip and it was insightful, organized, and educational...but also fun for the kids AND parents. Great facility and staff."

   "Definitely a place you can spend a good bit of time with so many historical things to see. Spent three hours here & that was just skimming over most things.\n\nThings have been greatly organized and labeled since my last visit in the late '70s. So much has been donated that everyone is bound to find an interest - old farming equipment,  kitchen tools, blacksmithing, old country store, medical instruments,  mourning hair jewelry,  etc.",
   "We happened upon this amazing museum on a recent trip to Baton Rouge. If you are in this area this is a must see place. Many old style buildings and they seem to be true to the time period depicted by the buildings and grounds. I placed four photos on this site. One of the exterior of the Black Smith Shop, and the Hardware store, as well as an interior shot of the Hardware store, and another of a typical home of the era.",
   "Wonderful place to visit! The kids and I both love it. It's fun and very educational. I love their special events, all of which have informational available on the website. Definitely worth the trip!",
   "I was impressed with this indoor and outdoor museum.  It really feels like your walking back in time through a southern community in the 19th century with real buildings that were preserved from that time.  Fyi: the grounds can get wet and mushy.  Worth the trip."

The outside grounds balconies and intricate details in and around the property are beautiful! Gorgeous venue!",

   "The park is great for adults and kids but nothing is perfect. Let me give the run down....make sure you have $5 cash for parking. Bring a coke can to get $5 off entry fee. It helps. The ground is rough as hell and blazing hot so make sure you have some type of swim shoes or flip flops or socks. Do not bring food or drinks in the park as they will check your bags and make you either throw it away or you can go bring it to your vehicle. They do allow bottles of water but nothing else. Instead of paying their food prices which really weren't too bad at one place...put an ice chest in your trunk and fill it with drinks and sandwiches. The workers were attentive and the water slides are awesome. They have quite a few places for parents to take their little children too which was very nice. There+ is multiple lifeguards at every slide and swimming spot so if your teenager wants to wonder around with their friends...they will be fine. Overall a great trip with the family. If I can think of anything else I'll edit my post. Bring sunscreen!",
   "This waterpark was so much fun. They have awesome water slides, my favorite being the rocket. They also have a lazy River and wave pool which were very fun and relaxing. Best part is you can also access their theme park that is connected to the water park. My daughter and I just loved it. I would recommend getting season passes.",
   "Not much of a crowd today. We were able to find open tables and ride everything without long, long lines. Cement was fiercely hot, so bring water shoes!\nFood and drink prices not too bad. It's definitely a dated park. We had seven kids with us, and they had fun.",
   "Kids loved it, but not very pleasant for parents of middle-older kids who want to run around by themselves. I tried enjoying sone shade beneath a cypress tree on  some lovely grass and was told by a lifeguard with a rather nasty attitude that the grass is off limits.  Concrete and plastic furniture only for waiting parents.  Parents have to pay full price whether they slide or not.  For the high cost of admission, it would have been nice to have something to do--a lap pool for example,  or some grass to sit and relax on without getting attitude from young men with power complexes. I should qualify that most of the lifeguards were nice,  and the Pirate's Cove play area is great for whole-family fun.",
   "This place is really fun. Our kids are 12, 10, and 9, and they were able to enjoy all but one of the slides. (One slide has a 95 lb requirement, which our 9 year old didn't meet.)\nLots and lots of shaded tables to enjoy for free. If you want to tan (or roast in the summer), there are plenty of lounging chairs as well. The food options are plentiful and not horribly priced. \nWe left the park for lunch and had no trouble getting back into the parking lot ($5) or through the reentry line. There are lots of nice options for food nearby. We went to Zoe's Kitchen, but there was also a Church's Chicken, a burger joint, a marketplace with a deli, a sushi place, and a few other things. \nThere's also a Starbucks conveniently nearby for a java jolt on the way home.\nYou're allowed to bring water bottles into the park, so definitely take advantage of that. There are lots of trees to take shade under, but if you're prone to burning, definitely pack tons of sunscreen (Not the aerosol stuff-it doesn't last in the water. We know cuz we burned.).\nTip: There's a special right now wherein you bring an empty can of a Coca-Cola soda, and you get a $5 discount from your ticket. Take advantage of that!!!"

There is a track on the side of river which is good for quick walk and roam around riverfront. There is historical war museum as well. We could not make it because it was closed for a day. It is good place to snaps  picture  and spend few hours with friends and family. The cool breezes from the river also add adventure of your time. \nYou will definitely enjoy your time here.",
   "The plaza has been revamped a lot since I was a child. We watched the sunset around 6:30 and then later that evening walked along the river. We were surprised at how beautiful the sunset was over the Mississippi. The walkway is well lit even at the darkest part of the night. It was pretty clean on the day we went.",
   "It's a nice spot for a picture and view of the river. If you walk the levee during the afternoon or evening it's even better. Just make sure you don't go too late, a lot of shady people around at night.",
   "I love running at the levee on a daily basis prior to hitting the anytime fitness right off of government street ... they have a lot of events down town and this is a great place to take a stroll with family or even alone . It is pet friendly with water fountains equip for our furry friends ...",
   "Excellent view of the Mississippi River. Went there after dinner for a walk with family and loved it. There are bikes available if you want to ride. Surprisingly it was not at all crowded and you could sit peacefully there and appreciate the view. There is a train track parallel to the river. If you are traveling to Baton Rouge, this place is a must visit."

   "Wonderful and lovely place to stroll as well as to purchase some greenery!\n\nIt's not a long stroll, but perfect to take kids on a walk to teach them the names of many varieties of trees, shrubs, and ferns. It's short enough that most children would be interested most of the way through.\n\nIt's a beautiful venue for a wedding, too. The space is serene, the pavilion next to the pond is open, and there really would be so much natural beauty! I wish I had scheduled my wedding here, but my guest list was too long to be sure we'd all fit. We wouldn't once it was all days and done. Maybe for another party!",
   "Interesting & peaceful place. Free admission. Very clean. Loads of information about native trees & plants. Majestic & massive trees. Loved our quick stroll through. Gift shop on premises.",
   "Beautiful facility! Loved the peaceful books where you can quietly sit. Public restrooms would be nice however.",
   "Wonderful park, cool in the shade of the hundreds of trees even in full summer. The kids really love rolling down the hill and being able to run freely. Excellent educational and fun experience with several habitats represented and all plants and trees identified. Brought to us by LSU.",
   "It's winter bit still beautiful...can't wait for the spring."

   "Lots of space, a stocked pond and a well maintained dog park. Would love more walking trails through the woods.",
   "Ammending my review from 5 stars to 3 as there is now a cut-through on one side of the park funneling a lot of traffic through it now.  There are always a lot of cars, travelling much too fast, not heeding pedestrians, kicking up dust from the new unfinished road and making the air smell like exhaust.  The kid side of the park is still fine, but avoid the dog park side if you're a walker; it's dangerous and unpleasant now.",
   "My baby and cousin really love going to this park. A great way for your kids to cool down for the summer for free. You can also have a picnic out there. Because, the park is beautiful. They also got a walking trail too.",
   "Its pretty good walk around the lake, I think it's better walk in mornings time. You can found ducks near the lake so it's nice. If you have children this park has enough space and it is beautiful too. So I can say this is one of my favorites park"

   "This place is very fun for children and if you like something that will take a few hours. This isn\u2019t a very large zoo so don\u2019t expect all day to walk through. But it is a little fun extra thing to do. The lights at the zoo for Christmas are fun for the little ones and takes about 45 minutes to an hour to walk through the hole thing. Only a mile. The animals during the day are awesome to see and a great variety of small and large animals. The food is your typical hot dog and nachos food. The price to get in is reasonable and I believe it\u2019s free if they are two years and under. I took my now wife on a date here years ago and we had a lot of fun. It\u2019s something different and outdoors for a date. We now took our son here for the Christmas lights and it was fun. He got to see Santa and hang out with family. All around the Zoo here is not New Orleans large but big enough for a couple hours visit.",
   "We really enjoyed our Sunday afternoon here. Its a smaller zoo, but very nice. Everything was clean, staff was great, animals looked well taken care of, and the cheeseburger at the flamingo cafe was delicious. We really enjoyed the Otter Chat. Worth the money. Also noticed they have space for weddings, birthdays etc.",
   "Met expectations. A little out of the way but an easy drive. Free parking. Liked the wide walkways. Great play area and petting zoo. Standard animal displays with lots of birds, no lions or elephants.\nTrain was out of service but looked like a decent attraction. Will go again. Four stars for meeting expectations and value, does need some investment.",
   "Always love to go here, my 2 yr old always ask me to bring her to the zoo. Relaxing place and great walking exercise as well. We love to watch the peacocks walking near the cafe as we rest.",
   "A great fun and relaxing place for all ages in which you get to see many different types of Animals and species. I loved seeing the animals and it allowed me to relax and be calm. The zoo is a must see in Baton Rouge and my favorite part was seeing the tiger at the zoo and taking a picture of it."

   "My family have been residents of the area for more than 25 years. I have seen this area go from United States Air Force Depot 2 a FEMA trash collection site to the facility that it is now. The Reformation of it over the last few years has been beautiful. Today my youngest grandson and I enjoyed 4 hours at the facility. We only played on the playground equipment, the bike path, and did a little fishing. We did not utilize any of the Interior facilities, but we had a great time. I think it's great that b r e c has provided an area like this for this community. Thank you. Please don't dump all the trash next door anymore. I'm sure we can find another site to do that. Thank you again!",
   "First and foremost, for those of you who are parents there is a decent inside area for children to play as well as a nice outside. This is a very calm park. I love that there is not a lot of calamity going on around me as I walk or jog around. The one thing I love about this park is that the sidewalk goes completely around surrounded by a lake that you can fish in if you'd like. However, the only issue I have with this park is that there are days that there are so many ducks. The issue is not with the ducks themselves, but the tiny splotches of dung that they leave behind along the parkway. Luckily, the establishment itself is pretty good at clearing that off along with the rain of course. There is an inside track that I also utilize and love. The only issue with the inside track is that it is definitely not designed for a lot of people. It is free to use, but there are only three lanes for walking one of which is a single lane that is used for running. Like I said before the perks of this is that there aren't that many people. It's neat in there and relatively clean (for the most part.) For the price of free--I would say you can't beat it. By-the-by, there is a inside gym but in order to use it you must have a $15 membership monthly.",
   "Great hidden gem in Baton Rouge for birthday parties. Only thing is, I think with rental of a birthday room, the indoor playground should be open as well. As is the indoor playground is only open and open to public certain hours during the week and only open on Saturday on the weekend. We had a party on Sunday last year and it was great but the indoor playground being locked was a big tease to the kids. Hope they change this rule in the future... even if it cost a little more when you rent a room, I believe it would be worth it.",
   "Beautiful park with a duck pond, play areas for little ones and older kids. Well maintained like all other brec facilities. Walking loop is a bonus for adults taking the kids to the park. Indoor facilities were looking good as well.",
   "Love love love this Recreation center and the park is amazing,no one should have any complaints,its in a great location and has something for the young and the young at heart, great use of our tax dollars!"

A boutique on the first floor with artifacts reproduction and a restaurant on the 6th floor rooftop. Really worth the visit!\nAlso, next door you can visit the Old Louisiana State Capitol with its spiral staircase and its stained glass dome (see photos), worth a look! Didn't have time for a full visit :-(",

The portrait gallery and Asian art are truly masterful whilst the other 1/2 feels out of place, i.e.,  spiritistic \"art.\"  There  are only 2 pieces of local furniture with rich history which left us looking for more.  Beautiful views of the mighty Mississippi from the expansive windows up there!",
   "Excellent art museum in the heart of downtown Baton Rouge.  Has displays of cultural signifigant art by Louisiana artists as well a prices from around the world. The bottom floor has the student gallery, show casing the student's work, which was my favorite part. Free to students and faculty of the LSU system too."

   "Normally, this is a great place to visit because it has enough slides to keep older kids occupied for the most part, good area for small children, and the park is small enough to see everything if you make a 360\u00b0 turn. The bad part about this park is they've started limiting how many people enter at one time. This means you'll regularly see a line as long as a football field waiting to enter the park. Today we waited over an hour to get into the park only to be ejected from the water because of lightning. The lightning part I understand, the hour long wait, I can't. It doesn't take near that long to get into Blue Bayou and there are tons of people there. We've been going to Liberty Lagoon since the year it opened, and we've never had to wait like this before. From speaking to others in line, apparently, the long wait has become the norm. Small children were crying, understandably, up and down the line. One woman fainted in the heat and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. We were able to get a free pass to return to the park, however, the day was ruined. LL really needs to do something to get the lines under control.",
   "Kids had a blast....great environment!! Pools probably could use more chlorine....lol other than that, GREAT PLACE!!!",
   "It was amazing all of the kids loved it. There prices are wonderful. Plus there good food. I will definitely go again. One more thing if you are looking for a cheap but fun place go there it will be way better than blue bayou",
   "Nice friendly family place.  Very inexpensive",

   "They are expanding the park right now.  I like this dog park.  It's a nice size and the people I've met there are very friendly.  They have 2 sets of double gates foot entree as well as a water fountain for you and your fur baby. I can't wait to see what they are adding with the renovations.",
   "Nice field for running dogs and water for cooling them off. It would be nicer if BREC set up some agility courses or other fun equipment for the dogs.",
   "Nice dog park, but small. Dogs are almost always friendly. They've got a small dog pool that always seems to have a hole in it. Dogs are almost always friendly. No lights, and they close at dark, which is very limiting in the winter. Small parking lot nearby. Lots of trash cans & waste bags.",
   "I have a very energetic puppy and it is hard to find a place with other puppies who actually want to play! This place has them! I was so excited to see him letting out some energy with his fellow furry (new) friends. Will return!",
   "Enjoyed this hideaway park. Spacious, clean with lots for kids to do to burn up energy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc"

They're are plenty of benches,  a bathroom,  and water fountains.  Attached I'd a dog park that i live bringing my dog to. There is also plenty of grassy places to lay out on a beautiful day. The LSU lakes are close by if you want to take a walk,  ride a bike,  or feed the ducks.",

   "Love it... Great place for kids of all ages. Can't wait to go in the Spring and Summer. Educational AND fun!!!",

Right on the river. You can see the baton rouge bridge. The customer service was amazing in comparison to laberge casino. The atmosphere was Quant and everything was very clean.",

The hours have been reduced since we visited before, and we generously tipped the waitress who brought our drinks and extra silverware and plates as she was working on Christmas Day so we could eat out. My only negative finding has been the same for years. The desserts are pretty but don't have much flavor.",

However, there is adequate parking and a well shaded bench to sit at near the library. Overall, I prefer Burbank, but it's okay.",
   "This park has come a long way in its many years. Now sporting a nice soccer complex, probably the nicest library in Baton Rouge, a beautiful botanical garden, a park for children, a summer water park for all ages and a state police station that makes everything feel very safe. Definitely worth a visit and a place to relax and kick back on a day off if toy want to get out the house.",
   "If you are the type to actually read reviews on community parks, this is the one you\u2019re looking for. Plenty of room to run, playground equipment, restrooms, covered picnic tables, and soccer fields. Plus, it\u2019s an uncrowned area so you won\u2019t lose the kids in a mass of children. Great park!",
   "Probably one of the better kept BREC facilities. The pond is stocked and well kept around the perimeter. All the rest of the facilities are clean and well kept. Everything here is basically the best of the best you can possibly expect from our local Baton Rouge facilities."

I caught one little bass myself about 8 inches long right before we left.\nThere is limited shade between 3-5pm. It would have been nice to know which pond held which type of fish at the sign in post. Bass are in the first one BTW and catfish in the other. They have public restrooms that are supplied and clean. And cane poles that can be borrowed. Overall really nice nice fishing spot we plan to check out again with some different bait!",

   "The park borders LSU lakes and provides easy access to running / walking paths. There are fitness stations and filtered water foundations located on site in addition to picnic tables and a restroom facility. The restroom almost always needs attention - it rarely has soap & toilet paper and the toilet is often filthy. Parking is limited which results in the lot being fully occupied during peak fitness times and seasons. I suggest arriving early and carpooling if you're visiting with a group.",
   "Very beautiful and serene park. Love it!",

What I liked most was the trail is \u201cunmarked\u201d on the ground (so it felt like an adventure) its obvious the path and they do have a few tree marks just in case the very light tracking on the ground gets confusing. My first time I only walked the trail, did not visit the \u201cbeach\u201d. I will next time.",

I had to run with a stick in my hand to knock down the 100s of spider webs crossing the path. It feels more shaded and rooted than Comite up the road. Also more moist. The trail itself is strenuous for runners or bikers. Just dont forget to bring the bug spray.",

No big downhills although that\u2019s to be expected in the South.  Maybe like 3 spots where I gotta drop the seat.  Great flow and a great workout.  Do it twice!",

Make sure you wear waterproof hiking boots because it may have some water ponds on your way if it has rained a couple days before, which is very common in Louisiana.",
   "Awesome trails for beginners and up. Fun loop",
   "I went here because  there were so many great reviews. We were using Google maps and it brought us to the middle of a neighborhood I\u2019m in Google says park and you have to walk the rest of the way. We see a small fence so we decide to go right under we saw a little trail so we  followed it.  It lead  to a  ditch with trash and a  bike tire.  We decided to keep on going and found a electrical machine thing and in a little trail\n  We fall in the trial  and it was just a bunch of trees and bugs it was complete silence then all of a sudden we hear her yell watch out it was a biker. I do not Recommend this trail. It be easier to drive a little bit farther for a good trail."

I was passing through on business and I stopped by and spoke to a very friendly knowledgeable man named Stanley. He took such pride and joy sharing what was special to him and imparted great knowledge about the area. I'm grateful people like this exist who take pride in what they do and are excited to share their passion with others..",
   "Awesome history lesson 30 minutes from Baton Rouge",
   "Great historical place to visit. Learned more than I would have expected. Was shown all of the lock and museum by wonder people that were actually locals and knew the history first hand. Thank you both for a great memorable visit.",
   "Interesting tour of how and when the lock was in operation. Beautiful building in perfect condition. Grounds are lovely and includes a very nice view of the great muddy Mississippi River. It is free and has a small donation box.\nI recommend it!",
   "If you're a hardcore enthusiast of Louisiana history, you may enjoy this very niche tidbit of our state's story. The centerpiece of the town's attractions, there are a few things to check out inside the museum regarding the lock's history and how it all worked. You can also walk around outside and across the short bridge spanning the long-defunct lock, which once connected to the Mississippi River.\nBeyond that, there's not very much to do outside of simply walking around. Most people in the area come here just for that, and the area is rarely crowded outside of several events occurring nearby throughout the year.\nLast time I checked, there's no fee to enter the museum, but call ahead just to be sure."

Our waiter was great and very attentive even though he had another table of 20!!!! The hostess staff were great and overall it was a good experience. The bar is lively and everyone seemed to be well taken care of. My only gripe is concerning presentation. The raw oysters do not come on ice. I've come to expect it and I am convinced it serves a purpose. Other than that small nuance (mine only), it was a great place that I'll be returning to soon.",
   "The food is good at best, and that's mainly because you don't have to go through the effort of frying it all up yourself. You barely get any food for what you pay, the whole shebang platter which costs around $24, resembles more of a plate lunch I would get from my local church, and those usually taste better. Everyone has an opinion and this is mine, better places for seafood easily.",
   "A wonderful dining experience. Service was excellent, food was wonderful. My daughter had the vermilion nice size portion, excellent flavor. I had the drum which was the dinner special it was amazing, my husband had the seafood platter.  It was also a very large portion and tasted absolutely delicious. Will definitely be going back. A little pricey but worth it!",
   "The food was good, but not as good as I remember it from my 1st visit several years ago.\nWhat I am missing is the \"fresh, vibrant, original,\" taste of ingredients.\nThe food is good and rich but also lame because the main flavors don't shine in the dishes.\n\nWhat I ate:\n* Charbroiled oysters. Sadly oysters were overpowered by strong cheese flavor. \n* Seafood gumbo - Please serve the rice on the side. It hides all the other ingredients that should be there, though some small mushy shrimps were discovered eventually.\n* White cholate bread pudding - the sauce is the best part here!  Presentation of the dessert is well done. However, I recommend serving the sauce with bread pudding dipping chunks instead. It would be an awesome taste sensation that way.",
   "What a pleasant surprise! This was my first time to visit, and boy I'm glad I did. I'll definitely come again. Seating was fast. I really enjoyed the decor, particularly the colorful painting of the bayou. Our waiter was excellent. Pleasant, knowlegable, and attentive...not too attentive. Food was excellent.

   "Great take out experience, service was delightful and since I ate at home I was able to go caveman on that awesome bone in ribeye. The food was too good to eat on plastic so I plated it and lit a candle.",
   "Service was excellent as always. The food was to die for. The T-bone was melt in your mouth tender, and seasons to perfection. The lobster tail was amazing as well, served with candle lit warm butter. They even through in a birthday cheesecake for my wife. The drinks were nice and refreshing \ud83d\udc4c . Would give ten stars if the chart went that high. I've eaten at Ruth's Chris steakhouses all over the country but this is the best one by far. Thumbs up to the chef too!",
   "I used to enjoy this restaurant, however I will never return. This publicly-traded company took $20 MILLION from the Paycheck Protection Program, (with help of Chase Bank) beating out small businesses in our city that need funding. I WILL NEVER RETURN HERE! SHAME ON YOU!! Hopefully, you will be forced to close permanently and will be denied Bankruptcy protection."

   "When I go out to eat not only do I look for great food and a great atmosphere but I also look for great service and Stroubes has just that. I went in and ate at the bar and was greeted by the bartender Layla right away. I just ordered a water and asked her for her recommendations because it was my first time there. I ended up getting the Pork Porterhouse. The food came out fast, hot, fresh, and delicious. My water never at one time was empty and once I was completed with my entree I was immediately offered dessert. I took Layla's recommendation and went with the bread pudding which was phenomenal. I highly recommend if you're sitting at the bar Layla is an amazing bartender and if you're sitting in the restaurant Sidney is one of the best servers! Overall I had an amazing experience and I will definitely return!",
   "We have just had the best meal EVER at Stroubes Seafood and Steaks. The martinis \ud83c\udf78 were delicious and the filet Oscar was superb!!! Dessert white Chocolate Praline pudding out of this world! Waiter extremely attentive and courteous. So worth it! If you are looking for a dining experience that will cap off a great Baton Rouge vacation this is it! A must stop for fine dining.",
   "LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS PLACE. GREAT FOOD. AWESOME ATMOSPHERE. AND WHERE ME AND MY WIFE ATE AFTER I PROPOSED.",
   "The place was nice, and had good reviews, so I thought I'd try their 1942 sandwich recipe, for a change. As I entered for lunch, the place was mostly empty. Seeing that there were more than 9 empty tables next to windows, I asked the girl at the front desk if I could sit at one of them. She went to check (what, I don't know, there were multiple available...) and ended up sitting me in the middle of the restaurant, like 10 feet away from any window. Maybe she didn't hear me correctly, but I didn't want to be pushy, so I let it go - but this didn't set me up for a great experience at this place. I saw no less than 4 waiters and waitresses walking around (doing what, who knows, because every single table was set already). Instead of them, the woman at the bar took care of my lunch. This was the only person in the restaurant who seemed to be working, with me and two other gentlemen sitting at the bar. Notice that she was working at the bar, yet getting my order at a booth - while the other 5 people were doing... what exactly? Now, this lady from the bar was absolutely delightful. She took my order, made sure I had water a couple times, and brought me my check when I was done, all while having the most wonderful attitude that, frankly, made my meal. The 1942 sandwich was what I expected - different, a sign of simpler, more basic times, tasty without blowing you away. Then again it's $8 plus tax, but maybe instead of throwing a giant amount of fries, this restaurant could consider giving about 2/3 the fries and adding something like a pickle to spice things up. Other than that, it was a decent sandwich. Only my confusion at the rest of the staff lowered my impression of Stroubes a bit, but the lady at the bar that took care of my lunch, she made the day. Give her a raise.",
   "Food is high quality.  Some materials management issues. I have been here several times in the past 4 months. 2 times in the last month I ordered a Manhattan and they were out of vermouth. And no, not the next day, visits separated by several weeks. And for a seafood and steak place that only has 3 steaks on the menu, you can't run out of rib eye at 730 on a Saturday night. But 4 stars,  the food is good."

   "Fun night. Some of the cuts had a little more gristle than on previous occasions, but for the most part they did not. Not a good value for kids, but for adults who love meat, it's the best in town. The salad bar is even pretty good. The pickled spicy shrimp were my least favorite. One adult, and six kids was right over $350.00 with no alcohol.",
   "Texas de Brazil never fails to be amazing! The food was perfect. We went for our anniversary with a coupon for dessert, and they even made a little note on it for us. Very kind of them to celebrate with us",
   "This place is awesome! Many different selections of meat that are brought out to you along with a great selection of wines and desserts. Also, there's a salad bar with everything you can think of. My husband and I have been there multiple times. Trust me you'll love it.",
   "Best restaurant I have ever been to in my life. The atmosphere was beautiful and elegant but yet casual enough that people were having great conversation and laughing and having a great time. Everything was so well taken care of and so clean. Beautiful decor and very spacious room and very much space. Beautiful dining tables and settings. The food was absolutely amazing. I have never had anything so good in my entire life! Everything was cooked to perfection. The right combination of cheeses from the salad bar along with the different types of meat was so amazing! The waiter and the rest of the staff were so professional and courteous and generous with every part of our dinner. We had an amazing experience and I would recommend to everyone to go there and experience for yourself.",
   "This restaurant is the one I like best. I eat in a lot of restaurants but to this one I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very warm and the cuisine they place on your table is so good. I am always happy to have a good meal here. Highly recommended."

Cocha has an excellent lunch menu that hits that sweet spot. What I mean by this is - you won't go back to the office overly-stuffed; rather, you leave this establishment pleasantly full and euphoric! The atmosphere is great... something you'd see in a much bigger, more cosmopolitan city than Baton Rouge. You definitely owe it to yourself to try Cocha. I suspect it will quickly land within your top few favorite local restaurants! It's definitely a great restaurant for going on a romantic date!",
   "Love this place! Very attentive service, amazing cocktails, great ambience and usually has one or two veg friendly dishes though this is definitely an omnivore's place. They now have outdoor seating as well. Upscale but with a neighborhood feel: they aren't pretentious.",
   "Superb dining with a nice atmosphere. Waiter was great. Service at a nice pace, not rushed but not waiting forever either. \n\nHave eaten here about 4 times over several years when in town on a business trip and never have I been disappointed. \n\nSpecialty cocktails also great, odd combinations that work well together. Pricing is very reasonable compared to the quality of the food. Highly recommend this place for a good dining expetience.\n\nThe menu while not extensive features a good variety of dishes, about a dozen main ones they can concentrate on to make excellent. Daily specialties also. Menu changes quarterly with the seasons.",
   "The food was very good. The Garden Focaccia bread was great. The bread was lightly toasted, and the balsamic dip provided an exquisite flavor complement. The Garden Fettuccine was good, and the natural blending of the tomatoes and asparagus gave an extra depth of flavor. The salmon that I ordered was cooked to my request and flaked very well. I definitely recommend this restaurant.",
   "I had high hopes for this restaurant because it has such excellent reviews, but I was a bit disappointed. First, they gave us menus and when it was time to order the waiter said they just changed the menus and didn\u2019t have what we wanted. So he went to the server station and got the updated menus for us to look at, which was a bit strange and should have been given to us in the first place. The food was well received by the group, but took a very long time and the portions are small. If you are very hungry this might not be the place for you to go, but for a small bite it would be fine."

I could not get enough of that sauce. And the mango and bacon topped it off. \n\nThe Hallelujah crab was five star. Tender and clean, not overcooked, and the potato was smooth and season perfectly. Those veggies...perfection \n\nThe butter and bread were standard fare. The butter was so light, it did not have much of a butter flavor, and it was slightly sweet but not salty at all. The bread needed salt, kind of bland. \n\nThe sensation salad was slightly oily, and could have used a little bit more zip with either Citrus lemon squeeze, salt or cheese.\n\nWe will be back.",
   "Always a good experience. High quality food and service. Try the favorites or the chefs special, you really can't go wrong. The crab cakes are way more crab than cake and delicious.",

   "Traveling from Dallas to Gulf Shores we decided to stop here for lunch because of the reviews. It was mixed for my family. Not really worth the trouble to stop. \n\nSome of the food was really good but there were lots of missed steps. Our waitress was very friendly but didn't listen to our order. We were missing several items ordered and the things we got were not done to request. \n\nI had the Delta Queen and the fish was really good. But the lobster cream sauce was not good. It was more like a creole Alfredo sauce. Way to over reduced to the point of a cheese sauce. Bread was horrible, hush puppies were worse. Even my daughter said her sandwich bun was gross. \n\nIced tea was great as should be for the deep South. \n\nNot a place I would go out of the way for.",
   "The food was so delicious.  Grilled oysters are a must.  The stuffed mushroom was also a welcomed surprise.  No complaints about the service or the food.  I'll have to go back and see what the rest of the menu has to offer.  The kids popcorn shrimp is enough to share.  My 6 year old son barely put a dent in it.",
   "Very nice place food is excellent. They give you plenty of food when you order something. I think the prices are reasonable. I got the Fish platter combination and I also got the oysters. They were cooked first time for me with garlic and a little bit of breading. They were fantastic. The place sits right next to This Little River right on the water. The only problem I would have with this place is the people that go to seat you. There not the friendliest. But the actual waitresses and waiters are very nice. I went there twice already. Definitely a place I will go back to in the future. There's also believe it or not two different sets of bathrooms. So if you're in the back of the restaurant you have bathrooms or if your towards the front or middle of the restaurant you have bathrooms. Pretty nice",
   "The oysters are outstanding! The shrimp and alligator cheesecake cake was very flavorful and unique. We were in town for my son's soccer tournament and someone told us about this. It was the only place we ate at twice the entire week. Everything I had, which was oysters and seafood, was delicious. The beer was cold and had 2 great servers!",
   "AMAZING food. Especially the Shrimp and Alligator Cheesecake. Sounds weird, but it's amazingly good. Not sweet as the word cheesecake may sound, but instead savory and rich. The staff are very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. Definitely will be back. Hopefully, sooner than later."

I had a wonderful time there. The salad I had was tossed in pepper jelly. It was not as presentable but it was okay",
   "In general, I always enjoy The Chimes. Unfortunately, this first trip to the new rooftop patio did not meet that expectation. We went on a Sunday during brunch so, we figured it would be busy. It was. But, the food was good and the patio was really nice. We enjoyed the views, the weather and the people watching. What really ruined it was the service. We waited nearly an hour for a beer and, even after asking several of the staff a few times about it, still didnt get that beer until we were almost finished the meal. We also waited a really long time just to order anything at all and were only successful after flagging down several different people. We were never really sure who was our server since  we never saw the same person twice.  The staff was running ragged and almost impossible to catch. The patio experience definitely had a hectic and understaffed feel to it from the start to the finish of the meal. I strongly recommend more upstairs staff if only to avoid detracting from an otherwise very nice experience.",
   "Decent place not as homey as the much larger one in Covington. Plenty to drink and eat + a few extra items.\n\nIt could use a touch of personality tho in the building and staff. Other than that great place for a weekend",

Portion was too much for me to eat in one sitting so took the rest home for supper.  I reheated in my Emeril air fryer and they were just as crisp as they were for lunch.",
   "Met a group of friends here for lunch. Hadn't been here in a few years but liked it when I had last eaten there. This time not so much. Service was slow, drinks were slower. Chowder was good but they rest of my seafood was mediocre. Had to ask for clean silverware as my fork was dirty.  They seem to have pretty good reviews so hopefully it was just an off day for them. Will give them a go when I'm back in BR. Pretty lengthy wait for lunchtime as well. Will update next visit.",
   "The atmosphere was great. The waiter George was great. The raw, grilled and BBQ oysters were excellent. We as a 13 top did bombard them by initially ordering 5 dozens oysters, but the seared tuna had no flavor, the blackened tuna was over cooked as well as the Salmon. Of course the fired things were good and the sweet potato fries were delicious. I think the cook was overwhelmed with a lot of late parties. They close at 9 and we were served dinner at 9:30. :("

The dining staff work together to fill empty glasses and remove finished plates.  Despite the mechanics, the staff are personable and knowledgeable about the menu and wines.\n\nI typically order salmon, trout, red fish, or drum.  The salmon is prepared to the desired temperature.  The trout is usually prepared with a Cajun inspired spice.  It\u2019s not spicy, and not too salty.  The red fish is prepared with a lemon butter sauce, which get on the side.  The drum is done with a creamy seafood sauce that is delicious and filling. \n\nThere is an assortment of sides on the menu as well as 1-2 daily specials. I usually opt for the special because they are a bit more interesting.  The menu features the usual (broccoli, baked potato, fries, etc), and the specials range from fresh heirloom tomatoes to roasted beet salad to haricots.  \n\nOverall, I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant.

We loved The Little Village so much when we went for our anniversary date that we decided to start coming here for our big fancy Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone always says to order the bread so we started there and got all of the bread sides as well. The tapenade was perfect as well as the amazing red sauce and roasted garlic. Everything paired so nicely with the stunningly delicious bread. My husband ordered the veal alla parmigiana (you can tell in the picture that he loved it because it's almost completely gone) and I ordered a ribeye with jumbo lump crabmeat and bearnaise sauce. This was easily one of the best steaks I've ever had. We also decided to split the baked lobster mac and cheese (to die for). Everything also came with a side salad and a potato or vegetable of the day. We couldn't finish the cheddar mashed potatoes or half of the lobster mac so we got those to go. We thought we didn't have room for dessert but our waiter, Jeff, talked us into the sticky toffee pudding cake. It was a gingerbread-esque cake served with caramel gelato and warm toffee sauce. We ate every single bite. I will say that this restaurant is on the pricier side but definitely worth every penny."

   "Excellent thin crust pizza and probably  the best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had. Cool place but usually very busy. Expect it to take some time to get your food. Your patience will be rewarded.",
   "This pizza place is amazing. Food is always on point and they have a ton of amazing draft beers. You can fill growlers here as well. The spin dip is, in my opinion, the best in baton rouge.",
   "Happy hour at Red Zeppelin is awesome. Pizza is very inexpensive. It was an awesome day to sit on the patio. They have a pretty good beer selection too!",
   "Great place. Parking is horrendous. Food is delicious. Once again parking and getting in to park is a hassle. That's really the only issue. Other than that the waitress was wonderful the bar was good."

   "I haven't been to Anthony's Deli since they moved into the new location, which was probably +5 years ago.

The muffoletta I ordered could not have been more perfect, you can tell that the little Italian woman in the kitchen made it with love.",
   "Best Italian anywhere very authentic and family owned operation.  Best people and best food in br!!",
   "This place is amazing! My husband and I frequented it when we lived in LA and always make sure to drop by when we come for visits home! We usually order a couple of sandwiches to bring home with us! Their pepperoni pizza on muffuletta bread....I've yet to find anything better!",
   "Anthony\u2019s is an excellent lunch spot for a nice day even in the fall you can sit outside and enjoy the views on government street while you eat all done at Italian food. I love the pasta salad and also go simple at this place meatballs and spaghetti is the best. Friendly owners"

I had the Crawfish/shrimp etouffee with dressing, honestly there are no words to describe this fine delicacy.  I enquired about the glazed chicken (chicken souse) they sell in the deli fridge and they quickly offered a sample....  \"that souse has flavors that pop in your mouth\" is how my son described that to me.  The pecan pralines I took home have a perfect sweetness.  I will definitely make a pit stop here again or take a 7 hour road trip just to eat here!",

I got the shrimp poor boy, and the bread had a nice crispy crust to it without being tough. The shrimp were lightly battered and fresh without being heavy or greasy at all. The sandwich had just the right level of spice to it and was full of flavor. The Mississippi Mud was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had a great visit and will be back.",

The best I've ever had! Spicy but not too spicy, crispy with a flaky batter and still crunchy! Three onion rings looked just as good and I can't wait to come back to Baton Rouge to visit again and try them! The bread pudding was heavenly! And I don't normally care much for bread pudding (but they were sold out of the Mississippi Mudd!) The Community Coffee was the perfect addition to the meal and the staff were all so incredibly friendly! I seriously can't wait to return! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

The building is interior is well maintained, everything was clean, and the staff is immediately friendly.\n\n The food is prompt and fresh from the kitchen and tastes like home, the service is frequent and warm, and the desserts (and pies) are fantastic. They are worth what they charge, and while some of the foods might seem odd, they are well worth trying. Fantastic job and thank you so much for the experience.",
   "Wonderful food and great service!!  We will definitely be back. So many things on the menu we want to try. We went during brunch and just didn't realize how busy they would be. But, our wait was less than they said and the food came out pretty quickly. Our server was super friendly as well. Everything was so good!  If they have the brussel sprouts as a side would highly recommend. Loved the Eye of the Tiger pie so much we almost took a whole one home.",
   "Cute modern place with great food! Just discovered this place and decided to go with my mom. Everything was great. We shared the seafood pot pie and had a side salad that came with it. I liked the dressing that came with the salad as well! The pie was great too. Well come back and try the other dishes.",
   "Excellent experience at Elsie's. It's just one of those places where you know everything is good and you have to limit yourself to one or two things. They pride themselves on their pies and deservedly so. We got the apple pie, which is baked to order. Brunch has some good local offerings but can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",

This restaurant makes food that rivals food you would find at a Denny's in Missouri. Wheres the passion? Very disappointing.",

We ordered two shrimp small plates (one skewered, the other with fabulous toasted bread) and the potatoes with manchego flaked on top - all were delicious! My pet peeve is overcooked shrimp, and ours were prepared perfectly. I also had a bowl of squash soup which tasted great and had a velvety consistency. Our service and cocktail were excellent. Highly recommend for authentic Spanish food!",

Tons of options for small shareable small plates plus a regular menu, something for everyone. The whole Branzino grilled fish was a wonder. Paella, vegetarian, all types of things. Amazing. Great cocktails too and the sangria is incredible. Its a must. We just sit and keep ordering tapas sometimes. Great service staff, super friendly.",

   "Never having tried Louisiana Gumbo, I ordered room service after traveling from 1am on to get to Baton Rouge, by noon I needed to order lunch. No menu in the room however, went on the Hilton Capital Center to find a brunch menu. Next, called down to place my order, all good so far. Got a call back about half an hour or so later and they didn\u2019t have what was on the menu, and all the prices likewise were different. The food arrived about an hour and a half later, but I also knew they were slammed. The wait was well worth the Gumbo, best Gumbo hands down I\u2019ve ever tasted. I would suggest menu\u2019s in the rooms or directions about room service and menus at check in and update the online menu, it was not terribly difficult to look up, but it took some doing, and then wasn\u2019t correct. The person on the phone was super friendly to ask what else I would like, since what I ordered didn\u2019t exist and brought some extra cokes for the wait and cheesecake. I didn\u2019t order fries but I guess they came with the sandwich, man, the fries were so darn good also! I would recommend their food, the restaurant is highly sought after, so the wait is expected to some degree, but the food is worth the wait, the service was accommodating so if not staying in the hotel for sure make reservations. The Kingfish is set in the Hilton Capital Center Baton Rouge, there\u2019s an inspiring eclectic riverscape circle of cultural sites surrounding your dinning experience. Don\u2019t forget to grab your bowl or cup of gumbo, the hotel itself is well worth a tour, or even a stay if out of town, for a much needed respite, or artistic inspiration. It is a historic hotel, it was left empty for over 25 years, the restoration is magnificent, and it does have a bit of a haunting feel FYI. The hotel was still working on opening old tunnels that run from the Capital Building to under the hotel, from the days of Gov. Huey Long (assassinated in 1935) so I didn\u2019t get to see that part but it should be a cool tour once they complete the excavation.",
   "Awesome restaurant located in the Hilton Baton Rouge.  I went there for dinner and had their Crawfish linguini.  It was fantastic.",
   "Loved it they had breakfast in the morning and the young people where awesome and kind one day ill be back",

   "Adorable place we had lunch at and enjoyed a few different dishes! Very good southern food.",
   "I really had high hopes for this place after seeing one of their dishes in a magazine. It is a fancier type atmosphere prices accordingly. I do not mind paying for quality i prefer quality to  quantity any day. But overall I was let down on our first trip here. The food all looked great and presentation was nice I will give them that.\n\nThe fried green tomatoes appetizer was very good though the remoulade type sauce on it was a bit on the sour side for me especially going on an already tangy vegetable. The shrimp on top were big and cooked perfectly. \n\nI ordered the fried seafood platter with all 3 items fish shrimp and oysters for 25 dollars. I was very disappointed in just about all of it. The catfish had a very muddy fishy dirty flavor that allot of places that serve catfish have but the good places have clean tasting catfish, this place was on the bad side of that but not the worst I've ever had. The oysters were very small and also had a strong fishy dirty taste unlike oysters I get from other places that I frequent,  and the fries were soggy and tasted just like the oysters and somehow even more of a fishy smell and taste to the fries. The shrimp were good, the coleslaw was just ok. Their tatar sauce was also not to my liking. I am much more pleased with I get at other places for around 17 bucks with much better seafood\n\nMy girlfriend got the eggplant and crawfish pasta. It tasted ok but was very dry not much of any sauce on the noodles. The eggplant was way undercooked and the crawfish tails had to be chinese , they were super tiny and hard as rocks kinda rubbery with no flavor. For 17 dollar pasta dish we were highly disappointed I cannot believe they use chinese crawfish tails or if they arent chinese they are the tiniest ove ever seen come from Louisiana.\n\nOver all after tip it was 70 bucks for lunch for less than mediocre food, maybe we ordered stuff they aren't their best dishes but we maybe may not return for another attempt.\n\nIn all honesty I have had much better meals with similar food at casual style seafood and poboy shops with just as big if not bigger portions.\n\nI also ordered a dirty martini on their 1.50 happy hour and it tasted like an entire glass of olive juice with a splash of gin.\n\nIt wasnt the worst meal I've ever had but not near satisfied from a sort of place this is supposed to be",
   "Love it !!! The service was great and it\u2019s very clean ! The hamburger is juicy, the margarita is just right and the fish is fried well! It\u2019s tucked away in a corner with a nice atmosphere. I will definitely be returning here.",
   "was extremely excited about going to try Eliza\u2019s because many colleagues have recommended this gem. But upon arriving today my mind was changed. I went today thinking I was going partake in some delicious food and spirits but that was changed once we met the bartender/ manager. My cousin who like me uses LA Wallet. For people who\nare not familiar LA Wallet is your mobile version of your drivers license. Not a picture but an actual app that we (I) pay monthly for. The bartender/ manager told us that she could not accept the LA Wallet because the owners do not accept it as a valid form if Id. When asked if I can speak to the manager/owner she informed me that she was the manager has the final say. But it\u2019s the tone and matter of fact in her voice that made the situation even worst. It almost made me upset because other people were not asked for proper ID. Was it because we were of a different race. Regardless I will not be returning.  I work in the customer service/ hospitality field for 16 plus years and I\u2019ve  never been more disrespected and discriminated against. If you are not going allow people to use State approved, bill passed ID. I recommend it\u2019s posted. And have your manger have more empathy without being rude!",
   "Been here 5 times now & each time the food has been great. Fried Green Tomatoes were done perfectly and had fried shrimp & house made sauce on top of each was good as well. Bowl of Gumbo tasted really good also."

   "Every time I come to Fleming's I sit in the bar. The service is outstanding. The bartender Tyler always makes sure everything is to perfection. Fleming's probably has the BEST happy hour in the city and not just for drinks but also for food. This time I came in I was celebrating my birthday late and I came with my friend and we started off with the Crab Cakes and shared the 35oz Tomahawk Ribeye and got the Fleming's Potatoes and Creamed Spinach for our sides. We finished off with the Chocolate Lava Cake and it was all phenomenal. I highly recommend Fleming's because of the atmosphere, food, and the service I always receive.",
   "We visited this establishment as a continuation of marriage celebration. It was Absolutely Awesome!! The cuisine is soooo Good!! You must try it. We will be returning. My compliments to the Chef and all of the staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening here!\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f",
   "Went to Flemings for lunch this past Friday and I had a delicious lunch but the service was not up to Flemings standards. I sat in the bar and ordered salmon with a barbeque glaze and a side of sweet potatoes. When I say delicious I mean it was delicious, but the server / bartender was not up to Flemings standards. She did not greet me and barely checked on me after I ordered. There was one other person sitting at the bar eating lunch and she talked to him just about my entire lunch. Usually the bartenders are top notch at Flemings. I have been going there for 12 years and the last 2 times the food was excellent but the service was mediocre to bad. This is why I'm giving a 3 star rating.I don't want to see one of my favorite restaurants go down because of bad service. When you're paying $40 for lunch for one person - the food and service should be top notch and a 5 star experience.",
   "Had curbside service from Flemings tonight and the food was fantastic.    Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious .   Get out there and support your local Flemings.",
   "Wow. I haven't had a meal experience like this before! The service was impeccable, very friendly and attentive. The bread was done of the best I've ever had, crusty and soft. I had the Sunday special, three-course filet and lobster, ceasar salad and key lime pie. Incredible deal for INCREDIBLE food! I am so grateful to God for such wonderful experiences. Praise the Lord!"

   "In planning a birthday dinner for my daughter, I reserved a table of ten thinking it would be to our advantage.  Getting to the restaurant our table wasn\u2019t ready, the food was extremely slow to come out while orders weren\u2019t correct, and finally our bill didn\u2019t reach their \u201cminimum\u201d of $350 for a group booking. I had to pay $350 even when our ticket was under 200!  Moral of the story...don\u2019t make a reservation for a larger group!!  Tsunami put a damper on our celebration. We should have gone elsewhere-",
   "I had such a wonderful sushi lunch here ! The food was delicious! The service was friendly and attentive. The GM even took the time to come check on me and my experience. Aside from all that, there is no comparison in the category of atmosphere in Baton Rouge! That river view skyline is incredible! Food & Drink: I had the Green Monster roll and it was DELICIOUS and refreshing!!! Their cocktails are delightful too. I don't even want to attempt to type the name but it started an F lol! One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Baton Rouge.",
   "i dined here one evening while in town for business. i was seated very quickly upon arrival and the waitress was very attentive and nice. i ordered some soup and then ordered the sea bass for my meal. the sea bass was amazing. one of the best tasting meals i have had in a long time. however, i was very shocked when my bill came and the market price for a piece of fish was $48... considering i have had a bunch of sea bass, and i know it's one of the more expensive fish, i was shocked to see they were charging roughly $50 for about 5 oz of fish. other than that, the meal was great and i would be back. i loved watching the sunset from up top over the river"

   "A nice French cafe vibe offers excellent service and truly outstanding cuisine. It may be on the pricey side for some, but you do get what you pay for. Take a chance, you won't be sorry.",
   "Food and atmosphere for both wonderful. This is a fine dining establishment and priced accordingly. The 14 oz bone in rib eye was fantastic mushrooms and sauce compliment it perfectly.  V Pan roasted chicken breast was slightly crisp on the outside and super tender on the inside with the pesto butter was outstanding. We did not care for the cabbage it was a bit tart sort of a vinegar flavor. The crawfish fries for the appetizer was also delightful. The oysters Rockefeller soup Was enjoyed immensely by both of us comes with a  Fried oyster on top. The white chocolate bread pudding and the chocolate pot de creme was probably 2 of the best desserts we have ever had had a restaurant.  We had very good service and all of the courses came out perfectly timed",
   "What a great meal. The entr\u00e9 was duck with spaetzle and tomato jam. The sauces were excellent. The brussels were fried, and had a sweet molasses style glaze. The shrimp and gnocchi was simply excellent. The peanut butter cake topped it off. We got the cake togo because we were so full after dinner. The cake was excellent!!",
   "Wait staff was nice and attentive. Food was cold. Would expect that not to be the case for an expensive restaurant.",

   "The prices are a bit steep but the amount and quality of the food you get for the price is definitely a bonus. You can just go to cracker barrel up the road a bit and get almost the same thing but at cracker barrel you won't get the amount, quality or hospitality that you will at franks. In my opinion id rather pay a little more money and get a better overall experience then go the cheap way out.",
   "The food was good. The chicken livers and gumbo were delicious. The corn poppers were my favorite. The shrimp poboy was a little dry. If I went back I'd request it to be grilled instead of fried.",
   "Awesome. Great family oriented restaurant. The staff always greets you with a smile and a hello. The food is the best by far. It's like being at home with family. I highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch. Just a good ole hometown feel with great service and great food.",
   "Great food great service. The server that helped us, I think his name was Kory, was very helpful. I had the Atchlafalya benidict, OMG it was awesome. Alligator sausage was so good we bought 3 lbs to take home to Georgia. My husband had the seafood grand omelet. It was very good as well.  So glad we stopped for breakfast. If we ever come back through we will stop at Frank's."

Baos at lunch are phenom (and only available at lunch) so don\u2019t think you\u2019re missing out by not making it to dinner.. The manager (Kyle) is also wonderful, super knowledgeable, and will make everything feel as if it\u2019s going to plan despite the restaurant being super packed. 10/10.. will visit again!! Baton Rouge needed this one!",

   "We have eaten here several times since it opened and been extremely pleased with the quality of the service and the exceptional quality of the food! The ramen bowls are all delicious (Oskar is my personal favorite) and the pork belly fried rice dish is smoky and amazing. Also, be sure to try the cold sake or a specialty drink. There is a very nice outdoor seating area where we were able to bring our dog. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone from or visiting Baton Rouge!"

The craft cocktails were delicious. When I am in town for another holiday I will definitely consider coming back.",

   "One of the waitresses in The Chimes on Coursey was very RUDE because I used a chair from an empty table to sit my purse on. This was during the very early part of lunch hours around 11:30am where traffic in the restaurant was sporadic.  The waitress came over, while my friend and I were conversing and spoke with my friend inquiring if it was her purse in the chair. I informed the waitress that it was mine and she asked me to remove it. I informed her that I'm not a rude person and if someone comes and need to sit in that chair I will remove it.  I asked for the manager and another waitress. The manager came over, very RUDE, to say the reason the restaurant needed the chair was to hold it as a placement. Again I informed her that I'm not rude and since the hostesses are placing other customers upstairs, it shouldn't be a problem. The manager then proceeded to bring me a mangy chair from the back of the restaurant to sit my purse on. I declined her offer, so she sat the mangy chair in public view in stead where the other chair was. I inquired to my friends if they wanted to leave but they refused to let anyone drive them away. The replacement waitress name was Chloe. She changed the whole atmosphere with her pleasant attitude. She said that she's a server and she's there. at The Chimes on Coursey, to make sure the customers have a great experience. The kicker of this story was that a group of 4 came and sat by us, remember I have the extra chair, one of them noticed the chair was missing as I was trying to place it back,  the lady politely shook her head no, and got the other chair by an empty table. The lady said if someone comes by looking for it, they'll give it to them. However when the waiter/waitress noticed that the chair was missing from the empty table nothing was said. The prior waitress or the  manager didn't apologize for their rudeness. The food was very delicious, as it WAS one of my favorite go to places. But the professionalism on that day of January 25, 2020 was very devastating, demeaning. and unacceptable. I will not go back and spend my hard earned money at The Chimes to get demised and humiliated...",
   "Awesome Cajun food here. Place can get very packed so make sure you come here at certain times. Especially when there\u2019s a busy bar at the place. The food is very tasty, flavorful and filling. Definitely recommend giving this place to try if you\u2019re in town.",
   "Everything was awesome. My food's quality was consistent with how it always is, and my waitress was great as well. The atmosphere was inviting and friendly. As usual, the upkeep was up to par, so I have \"0\" complaints about any aspect of my visit. Both my cousin and I had a pleasant experience dining and visiting at this establishment.",
   "The food was delicious and a lot of food was provided. The chicken wings are some of the best. The salmon plate was incredible and the grilled chicken breast was amazing. I honestly couldn't believe the price for the quality and quantity. I'll definitely be back here to eat soon!",
   "This place is the mac daddy. It is by far one of the finest establishments in the country. The craft beer selection is a 10 +. The menu is loaded with Razzle Dazzle and the food quality and taste is absolutely exceptional. All of the bartenders are super friendly and attentive. The decor and environment is outstanding. The bourbon and liquor selections behind the bar seem endless. You cannot go wrong picking this place for a nice dinner or drink."

   "The restaurant looks good but the menu is quite weak.  The portions are among the smallest and the taste of the food is completely lacking.  I took Mongolian Beef which was just fried meat with onion, just so, without any taste.  I was upset because the menu was past the price for lunch and normal price.  I went to lunch and I was charged the high price.  I do not recommend this place.  There are many other city-specific restaurants on a much higher level.",

They also have a nonalcoholic Ginger Beer that will make you want a refill. The atmosphere was pleasant and the service was great. This will be a place that I would recommend returning to again and again.",
   "We just had dinner here, and we had an enjoyable and pleasant experience. The service is always great, from the host to the servers, everyone works together to get the job done. My husband ordered the Salmon with the glaze on the side. The team in the back realized they made the Salmon wrong. After a very brief delay, the chef himself brought out the correctly prepared Salmon just as my husband ordered it and he apologized for the error. Wow! I have never seen that before. Talk about great customer service!! Everything was cooked to perfection. Our waitress was so attentive and nice.We drove over 1 hour to eat here and it was worth it!"

Each table was set and ready for you to enjoy some of the best italian food I've had in the Baton Rouge area. The food came out timely with filling portions and with quality that rivals places like the Little Vilage and other similar joints. A very nice choice for a special night with a loved one.",
   "I have eaten here quite a few times now. The service is always great. They checked on us a few times throughout our dinner and even poured our wine for us. Prices are especially reasonable considering the atmosphere and the quality of service and attention provided to each table. Modern design aspects that don't take away from a great feel of an Italian restaurant. Went on a Saturday night and enjoyed live piano music! Definitely returning for more great experiences.",
   "Eggplant parm, Italian cream cake for dessert. Delicious! Great service. Will definitely come again."

   "I came across BLDG5 after looking for prepared meals for pick up. The menu looked awesome and during these times it is difficult to find a healthy, well rounded meal from the grocery stores. Many are picked over and being 34 weeks pregnant my only trips are to my OB appointments. My husband and I ordered lunch from the regular menu ahead of time - he ordered the original chicken sandwich and I ordered the short rib sandwich. It was by far the best sandwich I have ever had. My husband also raved about his sandwich. We ordered the blueberry lemonade and it was very tasty. My husband told me pick up was easy, he stayed in the car, called ahead and they brought everything out to him. We also ordered frozen meals and a prepared meal. It was delicious. We heated up the food per the instructions and everything tasted great, all while getting the vegetables we have been lacking and proteins. Thank you to Amber for assisting with ordering ahead. She communicated quickly to me and  I really appreciated BLDG5 being able to make the frozen meals requested that were not in stock at the time. They really went above and beyond. We look forward to these times passing and being able to have a date night here, hopefully sooner than later!",
   "Beautiful setting! Great patio with lovely outdoor seating. The drinks are great - well balanced and interesting. The boards are a lot of fun - great way to share a meal. Lots of options on them, with some delicious sauces. Highly recommend!",
   "The best (and I mean BEST) vibes in Baton Rouge. Nuanced + classy design and feel, the cocktails are off the charts top-shelf, and the food is remarkably phenomenal. Easily my favorite place to eat in BR, thank you Misty and the whole team for realizing such an excellent vision in our city!",
   "Amazing dinner last night.  Food is delicious.  The dinner boards are a great idea. Going back soon.",
   "Fantastic restaurant all around! Food was delicious and well prepared, cocktails were tasty too! Atmosphere is exceptional and the wait staff and owners were friendly and informative. Can\u2019t stop thinking about this place - excited to try other menu items soon! Thanks for 3 years of hard work w this plan - it paid off, BLDG5 is outstanding!\ud83d\ude0a"

On the most recent trip, the flavor was still there but everything was dry. I used a fair amount of BBQ sauce to help with that but there's only so much you can do. For the price, I expected better"

   "Awesome experience dining here for it first time. Many have read my reviews of other restaurants and know I'm picky. Stinky's gets high marks in all areas. The restaurant was clean, the staff friendly and the food was on point. I had an oyster basket and my wife had the shrimp basket. Both were cooked to perfection with just the right amount of batter. My oysters were plentiful, served with a small container of coleslaw which was a different recipe than most places, it had pineapple, and was delicious (I wished there was more of it). There was also a generous portion of french fries that were an interesting cut, not too thin not too thick, also very good. We ordered a side of mac-n-cheese, which was a great move, best I've had in a restaurant in a long while. All-in-all, you can't go wrong here.",
   "We went for Happy Hour half priced oysters. The waiter took the order after 10 minutes the manager (I assumed)\n came to the table with drinks. I had a question about the oysters, when I asked her she said we don't have any oysters. My waiter never told us this, so we really were waiting for nothing. Then the manager said well since you have already been waiting let me see what I can do, comes back in 5 minutes to say, \"Yeah we're out.\" \nThat's confusing! If you knew you were out why would you say you'll see what you can do?\nThen I remembered she said they were out of Happy Hour oysters, so I wondered if I was there outside of Happy Hour would they miraculously have oysters again?!?!?\n\nMy son's pork nachos were good however.",
   "Since we were staying at the hotel, we decided to dine there for dinner. Service was pretty quick and our waiter was helpful. The only issue I had was my catfish was quite salty. Also my dessert was frozen so if I knew that, I probably would have picked something else. Overall it was not bad.",
   "Amazing food! They were a little slow for it not being very packed in the resturaunt, but the food made up for that. Great aesthetic.",
   "We stopped here purely because of the name. We enjoyed the food and the service was friendly. Boyfriend ordered the \u201cshoyster\u201d po boy and I got the shrimp and grits. We also tried the oyster shooters, that was an experience to say the least."

Clean your outdoor tables at least once a week, please. I've been to this location a lot and go because the outdoor seating is right across from the library. I love the decor inside, and I'll keep going back, but I shouldn't have to clean my own table.",
   "Get ready if you really love oysters - these are the best I've tasted in a while! I had 4 of the Brie and Bacon and 4 house style chargrilled - the seasoning and preparations were delicious, but the oysters themselves were astounding! They were lush and fresh and juicy and cooked perfectly - I was so in awe that I took a close-up photo for you! The ouster was beautifully intact and firm, gorgeous and delicious. I washed it all down with yummy grapefruit margarita. The service was great, even though the lunch server was by herself. I wish I worked downtown! Highest recommendation!",

   "We visited Capital City Grill on a Saturday evening and made sure to check the closing time, 10:30pm, before we arrived since it was a bit late-9:00pm. There was a large party finishing up and another table was seated after us, so we didn\u2019t feel bad about it being too late. \n\nWe ordered drinks and I had my heart set on something small like an appetizer of fried green tomatoes! Unfortunately, the tomatoes came out soaked in a melted sauce that made the breading soggy and unappetizing. I was able to eat one that was resting on top, but the others I couldn\u2019t eat and the breading fell off. The really nice server took the appetizer off of my bill, so I was thankful for that great customer service. Our table ordered the seafood pasta and grilled chicken dinner. Both meals were ok, but we felt that the quality of the dish didn\u2019t match the prices. \n\nThe restaurant was really nice and cozy, clean bathrooms and a really friendly server. I would go back and try again during a lunch hour.",
   "What a blast! Great place to meet with friends on a Friday evening and be able to have a nice conversation, it's not too loud but great atmosphere.  This place has excellent service and food. Highly recommend the tuna. It also has an excellent location close to rue Lafayette .",
   "Had an awesome time with friends during our company dinner last night. Saw at least two happy birthday party at the restaurant so this is nice.\nPros: Excellent spot in downtown with a lot of customer and The staffs are attentive and very nice. The food is pretty decent and the speed is not a wait at all. The atmosphere is really awesome. The restroom is clean and they are not busy even on Friday. They offer wine and beer which is awesome and everyone loves it. What I like most about this place is the waitress service\nCons: It is hard to find a parking lot on downtown at night especially on the weekends. You may need to reserve a table before your meeting.",
   "A SPECIAL TASTE OF DOWNTOWN BATON ROUGE. LOVE THE FOOD AND SERVICE",
   "Honestly, I'm not normally a fan of this restaurant. I don't find it has enough variety with good size portions for lunch or supper....BUT their brunch is absolutely amazing! Splurge! Go for the seafood omelet. It is so yummy! The sauce with the crab...amazing! The mimosas are good, but not really that great of a deal in my opinion. They make you think it's all bottomless, but each glass of juice costs extra...but again that omelet, so worth it!"

The marinade is delicious and it was cooked perfectly! My wife said \"This might be the best Mexican food I've ever eaten!\" and I'm going to agree with her. You owe it to yourself to try this place if you have never been!",
   "Ordered 4 margaritas and 2 chicken fajitas Togo. It cost me $142. There was a service charge of $17 that I was not informed of. And on top of that I tipped them an extra $10. I got home with my food and drinks and found out I had to tortillas, no salsa, and no chips. I even asked the person who brought it all out of it had tortillas and he said yes. How do I get fajitas with out tortillas? At least the drinks were good."

I\u2019m never disappointed here!",
   "Wow.  Best steak I have ever had, hands down.  Cooked to perfection.  The drinks were strong and the service was impeccable.  Make sure you are dressed.  We were not planning to have dinner the night we went, so I felt a little out of place.  I'm pretty sure they seat people not dressed to their standards in the bar...lol... no matter.  We had a great dinner and honestly, the lounge is more my speed anyway.  They had a guy playing the piano, quick access to drinks, and a TV so my husband didn't miss any sports.  Pretty sure it's the most expensive meal we have ever had- but 10/10 would do it again.",
   "Very nice wait staff and food. The Waiter had was very friendly and helpful. He always made sure our drinks stayed full and brought us plenty of bread. My wife ordered a caesar salad and it was very well done. The dressing and toppings were evenly spread. Many places server salads with just clumps of dressing in one spot but, this was not the case. The steaks were very good. I love raw steak and the first steak I ordered I requested \"Ultra rare\" came to me medium. I sent it it back and the next steak I got was the best steak I'd ever eaten in my life. The meat was so tender, it was like cake batter or butter. My knife went through the steak without any resistance. It was so tender, you didn't have to nearly chew it. The seasonings were perfect on the top. The french fried onions on the top provided a nice contrast to the meat and made for a perfect topping. My wife ordered the Cajun New York Strip in a cast iron skillet. She absolutely loved it. The marinade and seasonings on the outside matched well with the excellent cut of meat. The only thing she would have done differently was order the steak a few levels rarer because the skillet will continue to cook the steak. The side we ordered was Au Gratin Potatoes. It was also enjoyable, but the cut of the potatoes was not what I was expecting. I expected more of a thin slice and this was more along the lines of cubed potatoes or hashbrowns. Nothing really was negative about the entire dining experience. While Stab's Prime was somewhat pricey, our total bill was only around $120 without tip. I have no problems paying a for an expensive meal, if the meal is worth it. This was absolutely worth it. Excellent way to spend my birthday and I look forward to my next visit.",
   "The service is impeccable.  This was my first time visiting Stab's and I will be going back in the future.  The food was cooked perfectly and the portion was very reasonable. The ambience was very nice.  The light quality was perfect, not too low and not too high.  The noise level was perfect. It was apparent that everyone was socializing,  but there was no really loud talking. The restaurant was easy to walk through and the smell of food didn't suffocate the social atmosphere.  I loved it!  It was perfect!"

Classy style sports bar that is a staple in the neighborhood, and has been serving customers since 1950. If you want good service, good food, and a cold brew with your seafood Phil's is a must! Monday nights is 50 cent oyster night and would make a great way to enjoy any game. I will definitely be coming back!",
   "This place is fantastic! Service was great Dana was our server. The oysters were so good! I highly recommend Phil's. The food was amazing the service was fantastic it wasn't crowded when they has 50 cent oysters! Will visit whenever I'm in town.",
   "Nice restaurant. Friendly staff. Good atmosphere. I like how they allow you to make your own cocktail sauce for your raw oysters and control the intensity. Tried the crawfish cheesecake. Don't know how to describe it but it had a good flavor.",
   "Phil's food is the best Baton Rouge has to offer. I hear there's a new out of town oyster restaurant coming to BR from over New Orleans way. Well they had better bring their A-Game because Phil's Char Broiled Oysters are cooked perfectly and are absolutely outstanding! Now, I have eaten the char broiled oysters at the other mentioned restaurant many times and they are good. I'll put Phil's up against them any time. I also had the Shrimps Piazza...OMG. it is fried shrimp abundantly topped with crab meat and cheese.. Fabulous! Also, are you ready for this? The dressings are all house made. I had the absolute best blue cheese dressing I have ever tasted. They also have fabulous specialty bar drinks and beer in a frosted mug. There is nothing fancy here. It is an oyster / sports restaurant and bar. So, if you don't want fancy and do what some of the best food you've ever tried, Try Phil's. Our service was also outstanding."

   "Great food, great service! Didn't get photos of food but we had the napa salad ( approx $12) and chicken fried chicken ( approx $14)biscuits and they were both delicious. Bottled domestic was $4. Bottomless mimosas were $10. Bloody May's were $8 pc and really good. Place was clean ( posted pictures of that). We were there for a large and loud birthday party and it was a good time. Gabby managed the staff like a boss and staff was pleasant! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f great first experience",
   "This was a wonderful dining experience. Amanda treated us kindly and gave genuine and knowledgeable advice on the menu. The shrimp scampi was divine and was rich with lemon in the sauce. Portion sizes were nice, and we left full in both body and heart.",
   "We went for brunch and it was a rather large group of us, so a wait was expected. However, you would think that with the wait time, the food would be piping hot. Although my meal was seasoned well, it arrived to me lukewarm, which was unacceptable due to the fact that my table had a longer than usual wait(two staff members came at separate times and apologized for this, which I appreciated). The staff overall was friendly and attentive so for that I give them 3 stars. My suggestion to anyone going for brunch - get there as early as you can.",
   "The brunch food is good but the service is nearly nonexistent. We got a bottomless mimosa and a coke and over 45 minutes we had to flag our waitress down to order food and to get a coke refill (never saw another mimosa after the first) as well as flag someone else down for the check. Meanwhile the wait staff was talking and messing around by the host's counter and behind the bar. I'm sure I've had worse service, I just can't remember when and definitely not for a $46 brunch.",
   "My wife and I attended around 1330 (1:30pm) on a Saturday. It was not real busy at the time we arrived. I ordered the Twin Medallions and the wife got the chicken parm. We also split an order of bread with pesto and finished it all with some bread pudding. So the medallions were very tender and tasted great. The sauce on the medallions was a bit strong but paired nicely with the potatoes. The chicken parm was good but nothing spectacular. The bread and pesto were great. The bread pudding was not that good. The pudding was to soft, sauce was a joke, and the banana slices were from a banana that was still VERY green. Overall the food and experience was good."

   "Must visit one of the best Mexican cuisine in Baton Rouge.  This is one of the small hidden gems for Mexican food.  The restaurant is very clean and quiet.  Very friendly staff who will help you with the menu. The chef/owner is very friendly.  The food the amazing and to die for. Best seafood Mexican dish in Baton rouge.  \nMust visit this location.",
   "They're ok. I love Mexican food and I understand they're trying to be on the classier scale. However, the few times I've eaten there, it's just been kind of bland. Not bad, not good. There are just better options. The place itself is nice, though.",
   "Came from out-of-town and this restaurant BLEW ME AWAY!!!! They have some very creative dishes that are out of this world! I've never experienced a restaurant like this one. Trust the chef. I almost ordered my mashed cauliflower and eggs without the sauce because it sounded weird together. Nope. The flavors blended perfectly! The menu is extremely creative and they literally have a section for everyone - including Paleo, low-carb, vegetarian, and low-fat. The owner came to our table and when I asked about the cauliflower mash, he brought me a sample. Heaven!!! Brunch was so good we came back the next day for lunch.",
   "The food was amazing. My family and I went for Father's Day since my dad loves the food here. We brought two 3 for 2 fajita plates and the cuatro and it fed 7 people including a child. The chef took care of us and made us feel at home. The waitress was very professional and patient. I love the vibe and the artwork. Will definitely come back!"

   "New to town and walked here for dinner. Sat at the bar and ordered the Steak with potatoes and fresh veggies also added a side of shrimp. I had high hopes for the place considering it was walking distance from my place. The food came fairly quick but the shrimp were no longer warm, even tried them first as I know shrimp cool rather quick. Ordered the steak medium but was really only able to eat around the edges as the middle was still completely raw. Was never once asked how my meal was or the steak was cooked to the temperature I requested. Other than that the potatoes and veggies were hot and very good. Uncertain if I\u2019ll return.",
   "Went to Cecelia Creole Bistro during restaurant week. This was my first visit.  I had the BBQ rubbed pork ribeye on top of a bed of White Rice and black beans. And my dinner date had the Shrimp and Grits.  We both enjoyed our dishes.  The pork ribeye was cooked to perfection.   It was perfectly seasoned and so juicy.   The rice and beans was very flavorful and complimented the pork rib very well.  My dinner date said his shrimp and grits was very good, seasoned well and tasted so good. \n\nThe prices on the menu was very very reasonable The atmosphere was very trendy and nice.  We would definitely visit again.",
   "Food was very tasty and hearty. Staff was friendly and professional. Not giving it 5 stars because it was a bit pricey (particularly the short ribs) for what you get.",
   "Great spot for some fresh local cuisine.  Shrimp and Grits were amazing.  Wonderful service - so good I had to bring my friends all back for dinner.  Loved it.",
   "Very welcoming, the food is delicious. I had the Redfish Cecelia and my husband had the Pork chop dish."

Service is professional and make it personal that they appreciate you have come to eat with them. The music could be rage against the machine then frank Sinatra. Simple Joe is simply great. Check them out!!",
   "The food is just down right good.\n\nMy first time to Simple Joes, I walk in and I\u2019m ordering to go.\n\nIf you have eyes that work, you know just what to do, so I walk up and place my take out order and the counter.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure where to stand at this point, so I position myself somewhere off to the side of the growing line to order; somewhere between \u2018in the way\u2019 and \u2018in the way\u2019.\n\nAfter a fair wait, my food is ready. It\u2019s hot and smelling tasty, and after a quick inspection by the head honcho, it\u2019s missing an item. A quick fix, and I\u2019m on my way.\n\nThe coffee is delicious, they serve it up fresh and you make it yourself\u2014 my preference.\n\nFrench toast was bomb, eggs were bomb, salmon bagel was bomb. No complaints.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the neighborhood, definitely stop in. It\u2019s just tasty stuff.",
   "Landed in Baton Rouge early and starving. Looked up \"best breakfast in Baton Rouge\", this place came up. It absolutly nails it! Super good food, friendly vibe, Joe is super nice and passionate about his business. We had his famous grits, chili, french toast and more, awesome! We will be back!",
   "One of a kind experience. Super busy! You stand online to order, then take a seat with a number. There was a lot of confusion on tickets, but in my opinion, it added to the unique charm. Food is amazing. Very homey, get your own refills kind of place.",
   "Classic, very delicious, breakfast food. Everyone that works here is very nice as well. Heather, one of the owners, is very personable and remembers your name! Good place to get a quick bite, meet with friends or business partners,  and to study."
