   "Great trail system with distance and different viewpoints. Lots of area to explore and not a hard walk which makes it easy to go the distance. There are a lot of cutoffs, some circles, and even a few places to sit down. The fire tower is nice and tall which allows for great panoramic views/photos. During the warmer months it would be a great biking trail.",
   "The last time I was here was when I was working on my fire tower quest in 2016. There have been a lot of improvements made since then. Especially with updated signage. If you do all the loops off of Tower Trail, you can get a pretty good workout and enjoy nature at the same time. The fire tower itself is in Loudon, and I didn't go to the fire tower this time. That wasn't my goal. I was just exploring the other trails.",
   "Nice hike this morning at Oak Hill! \nThe fire tower is currently under construction so you can't go up to check out the views at this time. There's a lot of black flies at the top where the tower is. \nI recommend a natural non toxic bug spray made with essential oils and always check for ticks. \nHappy Hiking!",
   "Great little hike right in Concord, take advantage of what's around you",
   "Nice place to walk the dog and get lost in the woods. The trails are Marked really well. Only 0.75 mi to the Scenic views w/benches!"

   "We were pleasantly surprised! A good selection of exhibits and hands on activities. Very informational and educational. We enjoyed the planetarium and the movie on the northern lights. We spent about 2.5 hours at the museum. My son is twelve and didn\u2019t complain once about being bored. There is a small cafeteria and gift shop. \nWe had free passes from our local library, but paid $5.00 each for the planetarium show. It was a great experience.",
   "I had a great time here. It was not expensive, the exhibits were really cool, and the planetarium was great to! Spent a out 3 hours here which was plenty of time to see everything including the Planetarium.",
   "Brought my son and older daughter and they both had a blast.  My son doesn't really do well with crowds and the museum wasn't really crowded the day we went.",
   "So cool for all family members! \nA lot of things to learn, to explore, to do, is free, parking lot available, cleaning spaces, bathrooms, cafe, souvenir store, for sure is a place to bring your kids and teach them about NASA and Concord  NH History.",
   "I went here just to look for a squished penny machine. And I ended up staying and I liked it so much that I got a membership. I like that it has a lot of hands-on things for kids to do, even though I don't have any kids. It's good to keep kids busy in a place like a museum. And it's the kind of museum that's not like a regular museum, because you can touch things. They also have a planetarium. I will say the planetarium program is very old, and they do tell you that in the beginning. So it has some glitches, but still it was awesome to just stare at the stars for a while. The best part of the presentation I saw, which was the night sky presentation, was when they flew you to the Pleiades, because it felt like being in a starship. Besides all the history that they have regarding our space history, starting with the space race with Russia, it is named after Christa McAuliffe and Alan Shepard because they both came from New Hampshire. There is an observatory but they only open it the first Friday of the month, and only if the sky is clear. It is advisable to call ahead if you're going for one of these Friday night observatory events. I had lunch in the small restaurant that they have there, and I had chicken quesadillas that were absolutely amazing. All of the staff that I interacted with while I was there were very friendly, helpful and courteous, and that's important to me."

   "Great venue to experience the NH out of doors at. Nice walking trails and beautiful scenery. Plenty of events scheduled throughout the year. Closed on Sundays but the trails are always open. The trails have markers and easy to follow. Plenty of rest and informational stops. HUGE &TALL trees everywhere. Watch for woodpeckers and deer. All kings of flora & fauna to see.",
   "Always enjoy coming here. Several trails of varying lengths and degrees of difficulty. Orchard trail is ea the yellow tail should probably besy, 20 to 30 mins out and back or you can join up with the yellow tail and loop. Great for bird watching and you end up at the pond. Yellow trail is harder and loops onto the other trails. Pictures are from blue trail. Blue can be done with kids over 3(if they like to home) but yellow should be 6 or over. A few wet spots and some rocky spots.",
   "What a great place to bring children to learn about NH'S wildlife, especially birds. We enjoyed a wonderful talk on Arctic foxes, my granddaughter's favorite animal. She was thrilled to see one in person and learn about them and their cousins, the gray and red fox. We enjoyed the reptile room (which also had a lot of taxidermy)and also went up to the Aerie to enjoy the view. Their gift shop is wonderful and had a good assortment of small items that made a great souvenir. We'll be back in warmer weather to enjoy the trails!",
   "What an awesome place and organization.  The people there are friendly and very knowledgeable about birds and other wildlife.  Especially enjoyed watching the owls and eagle eat.  First time I ever heard an eagle make a sound.  The barred owls were rather vocal, too.",
   "Tbe NH Audobon McLane Center is great. The kids love it every time we go. This time there was a kids summer camp in session. It looked fun.\nThe birds and turtles were very active, hamming it up.\nThe trails are really well maintained. We walked 2 of them. The kids jumped and played on all the rocks and logs they could find. The bugs were relentless, so bring some bug spray. The trails go along the marsh and pond."

   "I needed a little more movement after a day of skiing in NH and this little gem of a 3.2 mile hike from Winant Park to Marjory Swope Park and back was the perfect apres ski activity. It was a little mushy (I wore the absolutely wrong footwear\ud83d\ude44), but the setting sun,and brown leaf carpet was a tannic and still wonderland.",
   "May be better in the spring and summer but not too many sights or anything to write home about. Decent enough for a winter hike with the dogs though.",
   "I didn't actually hike the trails at Winant park today. I discovered a trail that went to Swope Park and it was 1.6 miles each way. So I hiked that because I was curious. It was very well maintained! Unless somebody is completely color blind to red, it would be almost impossible to get lost on that trail. Also at the junctions they had very good signage. I would rate the trail as moderate for someone with my kind of disabilities. I wouldn't try to take a wheelchair on that trail. But there was handicapped parking at the Winant park parking lot where I started. There's supposedly a handicapped accessible Trail at Winant park, and I'm going to return one day and look for it :-)",
   "Great little hike.  Well maintained trail.  Have hiked here with my dog's for years.  Not to steep and usually very quiet.",

   "The Franklin Pierce Manse is the historically significant home of the 14th President of the United States, Franklin Pierce.  Set on a side street in Concord, NH, it is easily accessible.  The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their mission of keeping alive the memory of Franklin Pierce and his family.  My guide was extraordinary at painting the former president and his family as fully dimensional people.  The successes of the Pierce administration were highlighted, such as the Gadsden Purchase and improved relations with Great Britain and Canada.  Less was said of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and its aftermath.  Pierce's strict interpretation of the Constitution and his firmly held beliefs in States Rights during his presidency began the inexorable march of the nation toward the Civil War.  It is a credit to the staff and guides that after a tour of the Manse one has the impetus to delve further into the life and presidency of Franklin Pierce.",

My husband and I enjoyed it very much so. The scenery was gorgeous also. It's a fun activity for the entire family , age doesn't matter either.  I highly recommend this if you haven't tried anything like this. GO! \ud83d\ude43",
   "I brought my three kids ages 13-6 today! They loved it! The carts are easy to pedal! My 6 year old pedaled the whole time! The seats moved forward! I really enjoyed how relaxing it was. They have small baskets on each cart to hold waters. You are hands free, therefore you can take pictures the whole time! There are 3 stops during the 2 hour ride. You get to stretch your legs while they turn your cart around. This is a family owned business! The owners make the experience wonderful! They have put a lot of work into this amazing ride! We will be back! Great job!!",
   "Scenic Railriders is a great experience for anyone that has a fascination with Railroads and or Nature in general. It's extremely easy to pedal these Railcars which is unexpected and they are very well built and made almost entirely out of Aluminum. You get to see some scenic views of the river, go over a train trestle and pass a farm that has a lot of cows. The only advice I'd like to provide to the owners is to provide a little more information on the railroad and the history of the passage, and maybe a little bit more about his business. Otherwise it was a great experience and I would do it again with my son soon. Thank You Scenic Railriders From: #brocksjeeps",
   "So much fun. Very easy-going",
   "It was a lot of fun. I do recommend everyone try this at least once. It felt a but rushed, but that was just from the people behind us. We were taking our time enjoying the scenery and before I knew it the couple behind us was right behind us. The crew working were very friendly and put no pressure what so ever. I can't wait to go back in the middle of fall."

   "This place is unbelievable. I go there all summer. Looks like Switzerland. Great beach, there are tables, grills available, 4 dollars per person. So clean! So quiet! love!",
   "The views are wonderful! Nature at it's finest. What a great place to take in the sights and sounds, to get away from the everyday and just let things flow and be.",
   "Great place to spend the day alone, with friends or family around a beautiful lake.  The water temperature was lovely.  People were boating, swimming, fishing and kayaking. Lifeguard on duty.  Picnic tables, barbecue pits and grill stations throughout and available port-a-potties. Sites available for larger groups and events.  Great time had by all of us!",
   "Beautiful setting & pretty clean- but often quite crowded. Black flies are a problem out on the water & sand wasps are pretty intense the second half of August.\nAll in all I like it though."

   "I was here for the Shaker Furniture exhibition. The facility is very nice. The collection of works was excellent. I wish that more emphasis had been given to the craftsmanship of the pieces, instead of just their historical provenance. None of the cabinets had drawers pulled out to display their joinery, which was a disappointment. A better historical furniture exhibition can be found at the MFA in Boston.",

   "It\u2019s funny I don\u2019t think a lot of people in NH realize that we have our own Art Museum! The Currier is awesome though, they work hard at getting new featured exhibits and keeping their collection fresh!  They also offer arts classes and have a bunch of events throughout the year!",

   "I attended the Goblin Market production this past Friday, and was thrilled about the experience. Not only is the theater very accessible, easy parking, has great programming, live music, and an intimate environment, it's also repurposing an otherwise empty space in a mall - brilliant!",
   "This is a different experience. Sort of a cross between a small stage startup and open Mic. I mean this in the best possible way. It is an intimate setting. In that there are a few rows, so everyone is close to the stage. They use lights, screens, and a few props to set the scenes. The acting is very good, as is the timing. Everything moves along smoothly. This is a very casual setting. Maybe to casual. There is a bit of bantering between staff that make it seem as though they are still working at the process. Yet Hatbox has been here for a while. Well worth the price of the show, family friendly, snacks VERY reasonable price, and every seat is a great seat.",
   "Sorry it took me so long to try one of their plays.  Great evening.  We will be back soon and often.  Very reasonable price, so if you don't care for the play little is lost.",

   "Tour of the  Zimmerman house departs from the art museum and it was the highlight of my trip to Manchester. The docent was very knowledgeable about the house and had lots of information to share going from the design stage all the way through to how the house came into the museum's possession and the work that was needed to keep it in great condition for guests to walk through. Seeing a FLW house as it was actually lived in was magical.",
   "The Zimmerman house is a restored Frank Lloyd  Wright creation, built in NH in the early 1950s for a couple who both worked in the medical field. The house apparently cost about $60, 000 all in and is close to 1600 square feet with two bedrooms. The home althoug small by today's standards, is incredibly well placed on the lot and wonderfully quiet. The interior feels a lot like Kentucky Nob in Pennsylvania,. You enter with traditional Frank Lloyd Wright compression, take a right and enter the great room. It has extremely small windows along the front of the house above the banquette of couches running along the front wall facing toward the back of the house. The back side of the great room is filled with windows and planters that allow for an indoor outdoor feeling. Moving around the center axis of the house you come back to the kitchen area that's placed exactly in the same way it is with Kentuck Nob. The central Kitchen and operational center of the house is found within the central access and core of the structure. There is a master bedroom in the back off the kitchen. From the front door if you enter and turn left, you'll go along a corridor that then goes back to an open area that could also be a bedroom with a bath for any guests that might have stayed over. The home is maintained in a Suburban setting still by the preservationist of The Currier Museum of Art in Manchester. Tours start at The Currier Museum and take about 5 minutes by bus to get to the actual property. You'll be asked to don protective booties before you enter the home, and the care and restoration that the museum has put into the home shows. It's beautiful. And if you're a Wright fan, it's a must see and wonderful example nestled in the woods of New Hampshire.",
   "It is a mus for Frank Lloyd Wright admirer. Reservations required for all tours, it is recommended purchasing tickets well in advance, number of people is limited, adult admission $25. Tour starts at the Currier Museum of Art, little bus will take you to the house. 90 minutes tour is guided by volunteer and we were lucky, our volunteer was really knowledgeable and pasionet. She made the whole tour very interesting and added personal stories. Thank you! After the tour you can visit the Currier Museum of Art for free.",
   "Had so much fun in my daughters field trip today with my husband. We really enjoyed coming there. If you can appreciate art and a little bit of history this is the place to go. I have never been to any other art museum so it was my first time but seeing it in person was so much nicer than what people claim online or in books or through TV or movies. I enjoyed the entertainment they provided for the kids and got the kids to make their own artwork. This place was really nice one day i will have to go and really look at everything myself",
   "The only Frank Lloyd Wright house you can tour in New Hampshire (recently, the museum bought the Kalil House nearby, so the museum owns the only two FLW houses in NH). Worth the detour if you are in the Manchester area. FLW's Usonian house is at the origin of all American bungalows. The volunteer guides are very diligent about the house: you reach the house by bus only from the Currier Museum, you cannot touch anything --like in a museum--, you have to wear shoe covers, you cannot take pictures inside. They are a bit fussy, at Fallingwater, we can take pictyures inside."

   "My family and I went skiing for the first time here. All of the employees were very nice and the place was very organized. My family and I had a really fun day together skiing and taking the beginner lesson. A few of us (who had skied once before) did some green slopes later.\nThe chicken tenders, big cookies, and hot chocolate were awesome. During meal times the chicken tenders are disappearing so fast they keep coming out freshly fried. Remember to ask for marshmallows to go with the hot chocolate.\nI would happily go back here for another novice day of skiing with family or friends.",
   "One of the best family ski areas. It gets crowded but the staff is good at handling crowds. We had ski classes for the whole family and all the instructors were very good and friendly and eager to help. Tubing area is fun for all ages. It gets crowded too but lines move quickly thanks to staff. The slopes were well maintained. The lodge seemed crowded but we always find a spot to sit. The food in the cafeterias are good, too. Rentals move seamlessly.",
   "Always a fun ski area. Brought my son and we both had a blast. Lift lines were reasonable, as was the space in the lodge. We ate lunch off peak time and there was no problem finding a table, and no line at the cafeteria. Food was surprisingly good for ski area cafeteria food. I've liked Pat's Peak for casual family friendly skiing since I was a kid, and this last visit didn't disappoint.",
   "My daughter and I only went snowtubing. Forty dollars for two hours per person, price I suppose is reasonable since maintaining a place so big, especially since they make their own snow. It hasn't snowed in weeks and there was plenty for winter activities. \nThe staff was very accommodating to my daughter because of her needs and let my daughter ride down sitting since she was scared going down head first. I prefer not to go down head first as well since your head could take a possible impact. But, we had fun. Forty degree weather was nice.\nParking lot was tough on the suspension of cars. I saw on car bump the ground because the car drove low to the ground.\nVery busy and popular place. I would go again.",
   "This mountain has a very family friendly and \"homey vibe\". The lodges are beautiful and they are always making improvements around the mountain, to quote a staff member: \"There is no finish line.\" The customer service is on point here. The staff here are so helpful that when I brought my new boots to be refitted to my skis they not only offered to do it for free they found a problem with my boots and gave me a voucher for a completely free set of rental gear. There is no shortage of commendations I have for this mountain and their staff. While it may be on the smaller side, the mountain offers plenty of trails, features, and reliable snow making. I've been going here for years and it has never let me down."

   "I love 5 minutes from this park and go almost every weekend. It's a good little park and has some nice short hikes. If you are looking for something more intense head further north.",
   "We really like camping here.   It's unfortunate that it's getting so popular that everything is booked a year out.  Yet, when you actually go, 50% of the sites are just empty.  I'm guessing people from Boston are just booking it up \"in case\" they decide to go.  Would be better if they went back to taking walkups and not booking the entire place long in advance.  That's why they lose a star.",
   "I love this campground and state park. I originally came here for the first time because I was looking for places to use my new kayaks. I\u2019ve been back every year because of the wide variety of activities. It is such a large park that\u2019s perfect for hiking as well. Fishing is great, sunsets are amazing, lake front campsites are to die for.",
   "Another great place to go camping in NH. We absolutely love coming here when we can get a spot. It's very well maintained, quiet and beautiful. If you have a kayak you will absolutely love kayaking here!",

   "Very unprofessional. Called around 4:30pm and was told there was multiple spots available for two different escape rooms. Show up around 6:30pm to find store is closed when it\u2019s listed as 9pm for Friday. I proceeded to call store number three times. First time was a young female that hung up. Second time was a male that said they\u2019re were closed for winter. Third time same male answered phone and pretended to be dominos pizza and when asked to speak to manager I was hung up on.",
   "We\u2019ve done two of their rooms at this location. Our first room, and our first ever escape room, went very well and we had a good time. Our second room here, their hardest, was much more difficult. I think this is to do with some worn equipment - nonetheless we managed to work our way our. I think LOK\u2019d was is a good place to start out doing escape rooms. Their staff was very welcoming and made the scenarios fun.",

Since we went night skiing (~ 4:30-7pm), both lessons and equipment rentals were free, so overall it was relatively inexpensive! Unfortunately, the teachers didn't seem very enthusiastic but did their job.",

Both said they looked forward to seeing us again. My son was the only one that skied. It was his first time and he loved it! He had beginner lessons and off he went. We will be going back!",

   "I absolutely love it here. It is such a family friendly mountain.  We got married here last after a horse drawn sleigh ride. Instructors are amazing for our 5 year old.  Everyone is friendly here.  Summer activities are also amazing.. huge zipline, awesome ropes course. We have tent camped here in the summer and currently park a travel trailer here in the winter.

   "Since moving into a Mill building 2yrs ago in Manchester I've always wanted to know more about the history of Manchester. Not the negative stuff everyone says about this historic city. The Museum had a little of everything to see. Our forefathers built a great city and this museum shows you that. Highly recommend",
   "Great place to learn about the history of the Mills and Manchester. \n\nThe layout is logical and covers not only what happened, but why and how it effects the people back then.\n\nWe spent almost 2 hours going through the exhibits.",
   "For more than a century, Manchester was dominated by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, whose buildings still define the cityscape of today. One of those buildings is the home of this museum, which presents interesting and notable artifacts from the company's manufacturing heyday. It also describes the company's decline and bankruptcy, and the subsequent revitalization of the area, which continues to this day. If you're interested in local history, definitely check this place out.\n\nThe museum is one level below ground and was only accessible by elevator during our visit.",
   "One of the best exhibits in NH, tour The Millyard Museum and see Manchester history. At entrance, a penstock greets you, once delivering water to turbines powering the mill. Entering the main hall you see the vibrance water power brought to the Queen City. While your are in the building climb the stairs to check out the Millyard Lego Model at the SEE Science Center."

   "The Staff that showed us around did more than answer our questions. We were shown why American Indians were so successful fisherman, designing clothing from natural resources. As a culture living without our current resources, Mt Kearsarge Staff showed us how Indian choices and ingenuity worked to provide resources for a culture that was not mechanized. It showed me how American Indian culture provided not only for its own people, but designed options for obtaining healthy food, clothing, & transport for those who were willing to listen & share.",

The tour guides do a great deal to make sure they answer your questions before you leave and sometimes staff will send a follow up email if you couldnt get answers that day!

You can learn snowboarding with the help and it's nice knowing that you have a community to count on. Great place. Worth going. Even with the three different stages of hills, you still learn a lot.",
   "Super fun afternoon with our group.  The weather was great, the lodge crowded at times, but the food is great!  The tubing trails are fast and fun.  Even my little one was able to do it on his own at 5",
   "Great place to learn how to ski!  They have a great \"learn to ski\" program and the mountain is small enough to not intimidate the meek.  As a plus, it's downright affordable.  If you're a seasoned skier you won't enjoy the mountain as it is small.  If you're a seasoned skier and are teaching a first time skier, this is the place to go!\n\nThe snow tubing is probably the best in the area as they let you \"connect the tubes together\" so a whole family can go down at once on multiple tubes... Making it way more fun!\n\nParking is ok and can sometimes get tight like on holiday weekends. They have night time skiing so there's no need to make sure you're there first thing in the morning to get \"all your monies worth.\"\n\nThe food at the lodge is surprisingly delicious with average prices.",
   "We went on Sunday Jan 26th. We only used the tubing section. My kids (6&8) had a lot of fun. The downside was the moving sidewalk which brings you to the top of the hill is too hard for some people to understand, you literally just have to stand still. When people don't stand still, they fall down which stop's the sidewalk. That builds the line and upsets everyone.",
   "Small inexpensive ski area that is nice for kids that are learning. Lessons weren't that expensive and were easily booked. Most of the paths were visible from the bottom, which was good for us to allow the kids to ski freely without us. Small lodge, but food was decent and a small bar was open part of the day."

Funny sense of humor. Excellent bedside manner. Highly recommended!",

He keeps you comfortable and engaged while doing the procedure.  His nursing staff is pleasant and helpful as well.  I didn't know that once he's treated you, you can go to him directly if you have further problems.  Nice to know that.",
   "Doctor Nagel did a great job. He carefully explained what he was going to do and the specifics on positioning due to existing hardware. \nHe talked through each step during the process to help ensure that I would know what to expect.\nHe administered the 14 shot that I have received to my lower back and this was the first one that I could feel the medication working on the nerve from injection site to my calf. While a strange feeling I knew he hit the spot.\nI will be going back to see him for two more injections in the months ahead and feel very comfortable being in his care."

We are getting married in May \u2764 I tell everyone to go on one if their cruises. Absolutely best night \u2764",

   "I would highly recommend taking this cruise if you are already there, I would also suggest booking ahead of time. \n\nWe were on the Elvis dinner cruise and had a great time.\n\nThere are 2 floors and 2 stages. The main entertainment does go from floor to floor.\n\nThe Dinner is a buffet, as buffets go it is not elaborate with 25 options, but it had 3 main course choices, Chicken Marsala, Beef Teriyaki and Salmon. I had a bit of each and can say they were all good.\n\nThe cruise is about the entertainment and the atmosphere, we went the first week in Oct and at night it was chilly out on the lake, but still the stars were so bright and close also the moon was out. If you want romance take the dinner cruise.",

   "Great venue, wonderful staff of volunteers, comfortable seats, and they even have oversized seats for large people so they don't have to squish into a regular seat and encroach on their neighbors' space. Good view of the stage from almost everywhere. Good selection of snacks that are reasonably priced. This was Recycled Percussion from the top center balcony.",
   "Great venue for music! Volunteers are helpful.The concessions are expensive. Over $2 for a can of Coke. Water as well. Seating in the Lobby would be a nice addition. Bathrooms were very clean.",
   "Good venue, but not my favorite. Getting in and out is tough, bathroom and concession lines typical for a small venue. They do well with what they have. Great atmosphere and great people. I'll still go when they have something I want to see.",
   "Nice place, always clean. Great shows",

There was pretty much no downtime while we were there either, we used our entire 2 hours solving the puzzles. The owner / operator was super cool too. Recommend!",

   "We had an awesome experience at the Concord Escape Room.  I went with my family of 5, cousin and grandparents, and had bought this experience as a gift for them since none have done them before.  It was their first experience at an Escape Room and they were really impressed with the quality of this experience they are not eager to do it again.  Our guide (Leigh) was awesome, friendly, and helpful.  The puzzle was fun and challenging and the place was really professional.  We had a blast and will definitely be back again.  And the photos at the end were a fun surprise and a nice keepsake of our experience.  Highly recommend for everyone!",
   "My co workers and I came to this Escape Room for some team bonding. Most of us had never done an escape room before and weren't sure what to expect but we all had a blast!! We can't wait to go back and try the next room. We were still talking about our experience the next day at work... definitely recommend!!",
   "I went with my husband and two of our friends. We solved the room with four other people who we hadn't met before and ended up getting along super well! It was an awesome way to spend an hour! We did the library room and loved it. Now I really want to try the next room in the series."

   "Makes you appreciate your cell phone going to this museum",
   "Since I like history the telephone museum is an interesting place to see the evolution of the phone, reminisce about phones you had when you were young and see different designs. Great place to teach kids about the fact life want always cell and smart phones. Pair it up with the fireman museum just behind it and the look around down Warner you have a nice morning/afternoon.",
   "Great experience. I strongly recommend it. The staff were so helpful and nice. There is a lot to see so leave at least 2 hours. We didn't get to see everything because we had some time constraints. We used the app that you can download for free and it was quite helpful. Gave a good description on the tour around the museum. The firefighters museum for Warner is downstairs. It's apparently moving soon so if you have a chance, after the museum tour go downstairs and look at the fire engines and equipment. That should only take about 15 minutes. Great for all ages.",
   "I really enjoyed my visit to this small museum. I learned a lot from the essentially personal tour my son and I got when we visited during the week in September. There was a lot of information and facts presented in a fun manner and which explained a lot of trivia, like why some of the first area codes got the number 1 in the middle and others got the number 0. Easy to understand how the old switchboards operated, and you can \"ring up\" a mallard phone and hear it quack for it's ringtone. Fun! Absolutely recommended."

There the pub-style food was amazing and portions were generous, but the best part was the gorgeous view of the hill. Skiing offered enough challenge for all skill sets and cheap tickets are often available for day-of skiing, so don't be afraid of the advertised $60 lift ticket price tag.",
   "Great mountain. The skiers in my family span in age from 8 to 15 (and me) and this is a great first ski experience. We've been going here for a few years now, in a school program, but I would come here even if we weren't. Not a bad drive from civilization and a wide range of skill/terrain is available. The views from the top are simply awesome, spanning all the way from Vermont's Green Mountains in the west to the White Mountains of NH to the northeast.",
   "Nice ski mountain with great views. Not much in the way of challenging terrain but well groomed. A great family ski mountain not far from Boston. Nice for hiking in the summer with activities like disc golf and ziplines for a fee.",

   "We have been wanting to visit for quite some time now and we went on a fairly nice sunny day in early March. When you arrive, you will enter through the gift shop. When you pay for admission, you will then be directed to watch a short presentation of this historical site. (Definitely watch it! It is so informative!!) The price of admission is quite fair and you can either use a paper map and read along with the numbers on the site or you can download the America's Stonehenge app and it will read each site to you and you can proceed at your own pace. It is early in the year and I'm not familiar with how the trails look in the summer, but currently, the leaves are covering most of the site and some of the leaves are a bit wet so be careful when exploring! There are ramps to help people who might not be able to do stairs easily HOWEVER, this is by no means a place that is able to accommodate someone who is wheelchair bound or stroller bound. The sacrificial table was covered and I'm not sure if this is a temporary thing or a permanent thing but it would be cool to see it uncovered. We look forward to visiting again in the summer.",

   "Visited there twice in the Fall two years ago, it was very interesting and the short video of the grounds made it easier to navigate the premises",
   "As a NH native and history enthusiast it was only natural that I visited this place sooner or later. I first heard about it on the history channel: \"History's Mysteries: American Stonehenge.\" This year I finally got around to seeing it myself and I wasn't disappointed. The site was expansive and there was so much to see and read. It's an adventure from start to finish. Everyone there was so friendly from tourists to the staff, it was delightful. This place is a gem and I'm so thankful it has been preserved so beautifully. What a curious world we live in. Seriously, check this place out if you love history."

There is a small museum/interpretive center where visitors can learn about his life and read some of his work. The trail around the farm perimeter is worth the half-hour or so walk. There are several stops with his poetry and the stories behind them, and the field, woods, and stream are very picturesque. This was a beautiful spot with autumn color as well.",
   "Even in the off season with the historic home of Robert Frost closed the grounds and trails offer a wonderful visiting experience. It's truly like being in any of his master works written during his Derry years. At various points on the farm, signs are posted with his poems, all located at points that echo the words. My favorite is as the wood trail separates into two \"the road less taken\" greets you to read and ponder.\nThe snow was deep and snow shoes made the experience possible. Volunteers worked pruning Frost's Apple trees. A very good way to spend a sunny winter day."

I have eaten here a couple of times and have been impressed each time, but this place definitely stood out even more so after my sister's wedding this past weekend.  The attention to detail and courtesy to guests was unmatched.  Olivia, Kristen, and Claire were phenomenal - going far beyond what you would expect from a venue's events staff- I have been to a lot of weddings and have seriously never encountered their level of professionalism and sociability.  Guests have been raving about the wedding ever since, and it was clear that no one wanted to leave at the end of the night. We ended up going back for brunch the next day because the food is so good.  Our waiter, Spencer, was also great.  I seriously think they only hire the cream of the crop here. I would highly recommend this venue to anyone.",

The wines weren\u2019t too sweet like a lot of little wineries in Wisconsin. I need the chicken wing sauce recipe! We are going to stop at they\u2019re other location when we go to Portsmouth. Two thumbs up!",
   "The Bistro at Labelle has become the best restaurant in the region. 2 years ago it was just another place that was all price and not nice. The wine has never failed, but other aspects often did. Slowly but surely in the last couple years it has blossomed. The service is phenomenal, the management engages the guests and is always helping his staff (Ask for Michael, he always makes the trip extra special for you), the atmosphere had completely changed, and it has turned into a top spot for me and my friends. We cannot recommend those lovely restaurant enough.",
   "Hands down my favorite place in New Hampshire! Please do yourself and all of your family and friends a favor and get married here (and feel free to invite me too!) My husband and I got married here on November 2nd and people are STILL talking to us about how awesome it was. Kim was absolutely amazing to work with, as was her entire team on the day of (woo Kristen and Claire!!) Not a single detail was left out and the entire day completely exceeded our expectations. The venue is absolutely beautiful. The vendors they recommend are fabulous and the food is to die for. I am so glad I found this winery and I cannot wait to go back soon."

   "I loved Hampton beach!   Periodically throughout the length of the beach there are fresh water showers to get the salt off you and public changing rooms and rest rooms. If you are into shopping or a foodie, you will not be disappointed by their shops along the strip on the land side of the beach.",
   "I wish I could give this beach six stars. We went on a beautiful afternoon on Christmas Day with our family. I cautioned everyone to use the bathroom before we went, assuming everything would be closed. Imagine my surprise when we found the bathroom to be open - with heat to boot. Good job, Hampton council.\n\nThe beach as ever was lovely. Clean, well maintained and plenty of parking. We had a great day out.",
   "Great public and state park beach areas.  Good for quiet beach access ( state park ) or more busy beach access with food and fun stuff to do.  Amusements are a bit cheesy but still fun if you want to step away from the beach for a while.",
   "We enjoy Hampton Beach because of everything it is.  Great beach, boardwalk, the strip, entertainment, many restaurants, great place for the family vacation and/or adults. We've been going for years and will continue.",
   "One of the nicest beaches in New England.  Wonderful sandy beach and expansive view of the ocean.  Dunes add character and charm."

The owners are there and there is a good chance you will meet or see one of them during your visit. Not an absentee ownership group. More beers on tap than anywhere in concord! I suggest eating your meal in the pub and enjoy a sporting event on one of their many TVs.",

   "I don\u2019t say this lightly, but this is literally one of the, if not the, best breakfast restaurants that I know of.    And, I do not mean just in Concord or even in NH but anywhere in the country.  You have to put up with a crowd and it is a small place, but they consistently deliver amazing food and friendly service.  Variety of menu choices and never had a bad thing.  Quaint atmosphere.  Coffee while you wait.  This is THE place to go.  For the record, I like other locations I have visited but Concord is far and away the best.",
   "First visit was pretty good. Place is clean and fresh looking.  Food was tasty but plate's arrived cold. Our waitress was the reason this review got a 4 instead of a 5. I watched the waitress across from us making sure her customers were well taken care of while I couldn't find my waitress if I had GPS. May try it once more because of the food but will ask for a different waitress.",
   "This place is well worth the wait. Friendly staff, quick service, and the food: excellent! Fresh ingredients, healthy options, and all your standard breakfast options. Impossible to leave still hungry as the portions are large. We\u2019ve been twice in the last week. Our new favorite place in NH",
   "Was a bit of wait to be seated but since our party was large I didn't mind. Food was tasty and you get a lot for what you paid. Very good deal. Server was nice, our only complaint is they never bothered to refill our drinks unless we called them over. Probably will come again!",
   "We were driving through Concord and I saw several positive reviews for Tuckers & we lucked out that they weren't on a wait until after we sat down! I recomend the French toast sampler (on the seasonal menu)...it was a great option to try all 3 types which were all so good!\n\nFriendly service from Natasha, nice atmosphere, great menu. We want to come back to try more!"

   "Huge portions of very tasty food. The onion rings are incredible! Light, fluffy and buttery. My Black Russian was overstuffed with meat. The scallops are large and juicy and are filled with scallopy goodness. There's usually a wait to get seated so be prepared and come a bit early.",
   "Their food is so good and very consistent while also not being freezer food. You know you're getting good stuff when you go there. My family has been getting food there for decades. Highly recommend.",
   "We were passing by Concord and pulled off the highway to eat dinner.  We happened upon \"Still Beefside\" (I guess they changed the name with the recent new ownership) and were very pleased with our meal. The service was good, and the food was tasty.  This place is dated and not fancy in any way, but the food and prices are good.  We would eat here if we're in the area again.",
   "Got my Husband hooked! Used to eat there all the time when I was with a Motorcycle Racer who's sponsor was a Freedom Cycles Mechanic. YUMMY Been around a long time which speaks volumes about the food!",
   "If you are looking for a \"North Shore Famous Roast Beef 3-way\" you wont find it here. They say their sandwiches are famous. Perhaps for the locals in NH. I went here in search for the beef that you truly can only find down in Mass. Beefside proved this to be true in so many ways. Roast beef 3 way is pictured. Yellow cheese? not on the bottom? No onion roll? Sauce where? Mayo where? Beef sliced thick? NOT rare?!!. UGH!!! My belly was sad to eat this. My search continues for a place in NH that can do this beef lover right!"

   "Stopped in for lunch and I just love this place! \nThe sushi chef is super friendly and very knowledgeable. The fish is very fresh, especially on Fridays. Probably the best scallop sushi I have ever had. Their mochi is served at the perfect temperature so that it is neither too firm or too chewy. The service is nice and they also have small private rooms.",
   "This hole in the wall Japanese restaurant and bar is so quaint and surprised me with how flavorful their tempura sauce was, how neatly packed their sushi was, and how beautifully their mixed drinks were served. There was a particular patron that diluted the experience by talking very loudly at the bar. Also, Moritomo would do well to clean their from sign or get a new one.",
   "Decent food. Hibachi was full and sushi was fresh. Drinks and service had room for improvement but they were not rude, just overstaffed. All in all good food. Good atmosphere. Certainly worth a look",
   "We are regulars here. The sushi is always excellent. The crunch spicy scallop roll is out of this world. If you like more spice try the Alvin roll. The hibachi is always fun as well. Our kids love it just as much.",
   "A HUGE selection of food, authentic, great seasonal selections. They have some nice isolated rooms where you can kneel and enjoy your meals as well. Everyone's SUPER nice. Highly recommend."

   "Amazing hidden gem. Scallops were made to perfection. The catch of the day was Monk fish which was amazing. We finished with peach and blueberry crumble which was great, but the best was strawberry foam. It is served in a little glass jar, and is to die for. Google lists the place as $$$, but I found it almost underpriced.",
   "Fantastic staff, great selection of drinks. Laid back atmosphere but high end at the same time. The other best part is the food! Out of this world. And specials that will leave you wanting to come back for more. Just amazing.",
   "Great food with a modern atmosphere. I had the butternut squash risotto which was wonderfully filling and tastefully plated with a small arugula goat cheese salad. For dessert my date and I both had the Mexican chocolate creme brulee, which was delightfully chocolatey with a barely-there kick that was poetically appropriate for a dessert. I'll definitely go back again soon.",
   "have been here several times - each time I was consistently very happy with the service, gorgeous presentation of food, and overall taste and experience. the food and drinks here are rich, in the best way. this is a special place that I enjoy bringing guests to, and everybody is always super impressed and satisfied when we leave :)"

The soup was hot and delicious. The crab cake was so fresh. We will be here again. Thanks Granite.",

The lamb was also extremely tasty.The customer service was good. I found the atmosphere to be a bit \"lacking\" .... especially considering the location, it just seemed a bit generic or lacking in character.",
   "Overall good food and experience for a special night. Mozzarella app was great as well as spirits. Wife got the scallops which were large with a side of veggies...very good. I ordered the full filet medium rare, it came out medium well if not well. Mashed potatoes were loaded with salt, and this is coming from a salt guy. I'm not one to send food back to the kitchen as I work in the industry during summer months. Would definitely recommend and would go back.",

   "I'm jealous of all the people who apparently had a great experience here. We had a waitress with glasses and gray hair who was not pleasant. She was clearly stressed out and not managing her tables well. When we asked for recommendations, we were simply told that everything was good. The dishes were filthy. The tablecloth was stained. We were given cold bread. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes for an appetizer while the table who arrived after us (party of two as well) were finishing their dessert. The soup was cold and bland. Our waitress not once apologized for the wait nor acknowledged us while we waited for the appetizer. A waitress from a different section (young, dark hair, hoop blue earrings) noticed that we were being ignored and checked on us. She was the only good thing about our meal and she wasn't our waitress. Then it took another 30 minutes for dinner and it was not worth the price. The risotto was crunchy. More dirty silverware. First time and last time.",
   "The food is amazing! The scallops almost melted in my mouth. The sauce might be one of the best I've ever had, it matched the pasta beautifully. I would highly recommend going!",
   "This site is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to this restaurant. when  I I need a decent dinner, this is the place that comes immediately to my head. extremely good and many types of  food and a large menu.trained team, and agreeable atmosphere. And very important, the pay is modest. I suggest this restaurant with great pleasure.",
   "Angelina's is the best Italian restaurant north of Boston. The food is excellent, so difficult to choose from the luncheons/dinners on the menu  the waitstaff is professional,  attentive, accommodating, wine selection cannot be beat, and try to decide what you'd like for desserts (all made on premise), so yummy. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars. Thank you to the wonderful chef and the employees who help to make it our \"go to\" restaurant.",
   "Food and atmosphere were splendid, as usual.  Only downside was the server seemed in a hurry to get us out the door even though we had a reservation and we'ed been there less than an hour."

Crab cake was also amazing and cooked perfectly.",

You still get most of the same dishes with a decent amount of food but alot cheaper. You also don't have to wait for a table and the service was great! Try them out if you're in the area, you will not be disappointed..."

   "I cannot express how much I love Constantly Pizza. I live in Epsom but will gladly make the hike to downtown Concord to get a slice (okayyy, maybe a whole pizza). The service is good and the pizza is even better. The cherry on top: their store smells like heaven.",
   "Constantly Pizza has probably been my favorite pizza restaurant in Concord so far. The sauce and cheese have simple flavors that allow the other toppings to speak for themselves. It isn't  greasy, I mean, some grease, but not a lot. The healthy amount of grease for pizza.\n\nMy 8\" sub was also a ton of food, and it nearly made me explode eating it all. I almost thought I wasn't going to be able to eat the chocolate dipped cannoli. Almost.\n\nBut I powered through, and that cannoli was amazing. 10/10 on the dessert. Overall, I am happy with my trip here! 8/10",
   "Ordered \"well done\" chicken wings. Three of them were uncooked and had to be thrown away. The pizza was good, but we now know where NOT to go for chicken wings.",
   "Awesome lunch deal the day I went. 3 slices and a drink for under 6 bucks! The slices are thinner than your average slice but was excellent for trying different toppings. The plain cheese was bomb dot com.",
   "Great pizza and subs and a great crew running the place.  We order here for work functions quite often and we can always depend on timely delivery with the correct order.  Pizza is some of the best in concord,  well worth a try."

   "Everyone at our table enjoyed most of their food.  Not sure why I could not have a cup of soup instead of one of the listed sides.  I was willing to pay an upcharge.  I had to buy a cup of soup and my husband took the fruit cup side ... which was not sweet at all.  My husband ordered tea and it did not taste right.  He had to pay extra to get his drink switched to soda.  Again, most of the food was really good but the small things that were not right made the dining experience annoying.\nUPDATE:  Made a return visit.  It was our server's first day at work ... she was GREAT!  I tried out the fried fish and it was EXCELLENT!  Today's visit was a solid five stars.",
   "Very good food, great menu with lots to choose from, great cocktails and family friendly. Waitstaff is attentive and friendly. You will not be disappointed.",
   "Food was pretty good overall. Steak was slightly overcooked but looked and tasted very flavorful. Had a stuffed haddock dish that I sent back because it was still cold in the middle but they were very nice and understanding. We will definitely go back again sometime. It's a cozy worn in place but still fun for date night.",
   "This place is always a top notch !\nThe entire menu is good.\nTry the adult Mac n' Cheese ...YUM\nPatty Melt is the best around!",
   "Cool atmosphere. Food was very good. Ser or was super friendly but was responsible for the whole outdoor area so it took her a while to get to us. Overall a very good experience and very good food. Would recommend if in the area."

   "Busy place.  One of the best flavored steaks I have had in ages.  The steak was preceded by a nice loaf of bread.  Staff was courteous and entertaining.  We had a guest with a lot of food allergies.  They went the extra mile to ensure the individual was properly treated and served.",
   "Most of the food was very good, but I think the prices were quite high. For example, we paid $22.49 for four small grilled lamb chops. A bit more reasonable was the LongHorn Steak Tips (12oz.) for $15.99. All totaled we paid $69.72 (not including the tip) for 3 entres and one iced tea. \nI chose the \"Loaded Idaho Baked Potato\" as my side dish. It wasn't as \"loaded\" as I expected and a bit dry. I had to ask for more sour cream to make it work for me. The service was good, but not exceptional. The atmosphere was pleasant, especially if you like a cowboy ranch theme. Next time I would choose to go to an all you can eat buffet for $20 less.",
   "They treat you well with bread at the table and great service. I had a bone in rib eye and they come just short of the fifth star due to a chewy steak. I ordered medium rare and they nailed that target. Why was it tough? - I don't know - maybe we're looking at the quality of the cut of meat. Our friend had prime rib and he was in heaven.",
   "Always a good meal here. Usually very tasty cuts of meat. Service is on the ball! Great portions and presentation.",
   "I love the food at Longhorn. Good steaks at reasonable prices. I like it way better than Texas Roadhouse which is so noisy and obnoxious. Longhorn is geared more towards a nice dinner for family or friends. I only wish they had more vegetable sides, most of the sides are potatoes."

   "Honestly one of the best burgers I've had!! As my son put it, \"my stomach was jealous my mouth got it first!\"  The burger was cooked to perfection, with the perfect amount of seasoning and juicy but not greasy.  If you haven't eaten at this establishment it's a definite must!  This place has it all great food and an awesome staff.",
   "I want to start off by saying that that we got there at opening so keep that In mind. So we walk in and they hand us menus to look over quickly before we order like five guys style but supposedly nicer but within two minutes of getting there one of the employees discovers the fridge was at something like 68 degrees and all the chicken products were spoiled. We are not too disappointed because we wanted burgers so we order anyway. Are burgers arrive relatively quickly. I ordered my burger medium(what I always get) and I bite into and am eating and it\u2019s cooked pretty well but about halfway through I realize it\u2019s cold. Pretty disappointed!",
   "Great little place for hand cooked fresh burgers and a small selection of local craft beers. After you eat here, you can to to the other side for some gelato! The service here isn't fast - so don't expect speeds like the fast food burger chains. The environment is nice and relaxed, no need to dress up here. Parking is available in the front on the road, or on the parking garage in the rear (accessed from another road).",
   "Great burger/sandwich place with local meats and tasty sauces. Their unusual burger lives up to it's name and they have made fresh veggie burgers as well. Their poutine is delicious and they usually have a pretty good tap selection. Try their milkshakes as well, or pop next door for a Sunday after your burger!"

   "First of all, I'm a Southerner and we kind of dominate the realm of breakfast, and I was surprised to see some very southern dishes on the menu. I was told the restaurant was very good, and it's true. They must have some Southern boys in the back! I've had country fried steak that wasn't half as good as what I got here. I was very pleasantly surprised. The grits were decent! The corned beef hash is absolutely AWESOME and made old school. This is a really good restaurant for simple American breakfast and brunch food, and perhaps a great reminder of home for any Southerners in the area.",
   "I have tried this place several times (sporadically) hoping that it might get better. I think today was my last visit for breakfast. My mother had an omelette that was unable to be eaten due to the eggs being very undercooked. My son and I both ordered the Hash Benedict. The hash was not hash, it was a bunch of shredded, dry and very overcooked corned beef and 4, yes 4 tiny chunks of potato. I would rather have eaten canned hash. Our server, Briar, was really great about it. It isn't her fault after all, she didn't cook it. Briar took the omelette off of the check and took 50% off of mine."

I personally feel that there was too many flavors on the burrito to taste just one or two. The sauce was somewhat sweet. Not expected. May dine again due to convenience and speed of order.",

   "Why does it seem like every Seafood restaurant that exists in the state of New Hampshire seems to not know how to make real New England style Tarter sauce. Seriously you would think that any New England Seafood restaurant that wants to be well respected would at least get their Tarter sauce right, but NO, not in New Hampshire. Anyway, honestly, even mixing sweet gherkins relish with mayo, would make a better Tarter sauce than \"Makris\" awful, bitter, nasty tasting Tarter sauce, yuck! Oh' and I know some of you might say, why make such a big deal about Tarter sauce, cause without providing a good tasting Tarter sauce, you simply will ruin the rest of ones meal. Yeah, things like... Sweet Whole Belly Fried Clams will taste awful, if the Tarter sauce is terrible, and in this case that is what we exactly experienced!!!",
   "It was a last minute decision to stop by on the way to the lake. From the outside it\u2019s looks nice and with all the bikes outside you might think it\u2019s just a biker bar but when you enter the restaurant it is quite large. \n\nThe decor is a bit campy but clean, nothing fancy. The servers were very nice and helpful and my lobster was fantastic. Of course it\u2019s  kinda hard to screw that up:). Toni had steak tips which were cook exactly as she ordered them and the quality of the meat was very good. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question the quality of the food is excellent and I saw the owner walking around constantly, which is always reassuring.  He appears to run a tight ship. \n\nThe bar was packed on an early Friday evening.  Live band setting up so they have a good bar following.  Looks like a favorite place for bikers traveling 106. \n\nDefinitely worth a try.",
   "Lobster roll was okay, crab cake was excellent, scallops were well done and the smelts were a bit overfried. The fries however, amazing. Crispy and lightly salted. Service was good. Decent meal with reasonable price.",
   "I enjoyed this restaurant. I got the fried native shrimp and native clams half and half dinner. The native clams were market price for $10 a half.\n\nOverall it was pretty good. We had a big party and they were easily able to sit us inside. I have been previously as well and sat on the deck. The deck has its own bar which is cool.\n\nIt can get really busy around race weekends with Louden being so close, so be prepared for that. Also your GPS may bring you to some back road to get there and you won't be able to actually pull into the restaurant parking lot. You'll have to go back to route 9 and then head north on 109.",
   "The ribeye steak I had was great and the price is very reasonable. My only complaint is that I wanted prime rib, which I was going to have rare/ medium rare, but was told it was already all cooked at medium. It was disappointing because you can always cook it longer by request, but once it is cooked you can\u2019t go back."

You can enter from either side of the restaurant, they will keep track of who came in when. There can be a wait during normal dining times.\n\nThe food is good, home style cooking, no matter what meal you order. The prices are very reasonable. The staff here is a mixture of your brother who handles everything but you might need to ask twice; mother who will ask you three times if you have everything; sister who rather be some where else but will be fast, attentive, and takes the time to dialogue with you; and the aunt who knows everything that is going on even if you are not her table, she has what you need covered.",

   "Eggplant parm and French onion soup were delicious!! Great portions. Highly recommend. Thank you for delivering!!",
   "Marinara sauce WAY too sweet, should have stayed home and had Newman\u2019s jar sauce. Reminded me of Greek cuisine. Salad was poor and service was too. On a positive note, premises was very clean. Haven\u2019t been to a Veano\u2019s in many years, now I remember why.\nAmazed at so many good ratings, we dine out often and know fine dining, this isn\u2019t it.",
   "The customer service was great! The homemade italian food my boyfriend loved the lasagna. The potato skins was huge and good. Mozzarella sticks were good. Chicken wings and strips were yummy! The pizza was delicious! I wish I could have tried more. Great service and food! What more could you ask for",
   "Best breakfast in town! Steak and eggs were top notch. Friendly and efficient staff are the best. Family owned and operated, they do a great job and the atmosphere is perfect. 5 stars!",
   "Great service and the best hollandaise sauce I've ever had!!"

   "Part of my rating is because it seems to me the restaurant wants to portray itself as a higher end type place and not sure it stands up that well if that is the comparison.  Food was good.  Especially enjoyed the lobster pie.  Service was friendly but a bit slow.  I found the restaurant itself to feel dreary on the inside and in need of refurbishment. All in all, not a bad experience and I may go back, but I also am not going to be rushing back.",
   "We arrived 30 minutes before close and were the last customers there. Despite this fact they still took their time to answer all of our stupid questions about their menu and amazing variety of seafood dishes.\n\nThe food was amazing and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. Highly recommended.\n\nThe picture is of my baked  seafood stuffed haddock and  a lobster that was added on for only $10. Loved it.",
   "My wife had the twin lobster,  which was pretty good (how can you really go wrong) she said the taste had a funniness ( maybe from the water in the tank). I got sea scallops, 5 oz for 18.99, which would have been fine,  but they were bay scallop sized (maybe 7/8\" at most) and overcooked. The coconut shrimp that I got was excellent,  the best thing I had by far. The service was prompt and the waiter attentive and friendly.",
   "Excellent food, service, and prices. Gorgeous decor. Created a wonderful memory with family",
   "Amazing. The waitress was awesome, made sure we were happy more than once. Accommodating to all our needs. Place was clean. Neat. Homey. Love the fact it small business family owned an it bout the customer satisfaction. Price seemed little high for me but food was PERFECTION!!! I love food. Know good food an this place an it employees are awesome.\nall in all great. Keep going back no problem."

   "The meat pizza was great. I can tell the owner chose very selective toppings. Each topping stood out from each other. Great blend.",
   "Kids love this place. Slices are huge and cheap. And, they can pick from any one of a dozen or more different creations. Staff are friendly and typically will remember you from prior visits.",
   "As always I love food more than anything. And Sal's pizza is in the top on my rank. Good food and more important good people always greeting you with a big smile. The prices are good for the huge piece of pizza or for the whole pizza. Keep up the good work",
   "Sal's Pizza was the best pizza joint that I had when I went to Concord. It has a variety of options by the slice, but you can also order wings or whole pizzas if that is what you want. The serving sizes are a little on the large side, but that's exactly what you want when you get a slice of pizza. \n\nDefinitely the pizza place to go in downtown Concord."

She made sure we had everything we needed at all times. The restaurant was busy but she did not show any indication of being overwhelmed or frazzled. Everything was just great! Super grateful, impressed, and appreciative.",
   "I know. How can Olive Garden get 5 stars? It's a chain, they're everywhere, and often not as grand as local farm to table establishments. Well they at least appear to have their stuff together at this location. Plenty of seating, wasn't greeted immediately but was seated quickly. But then there was Brandy, the Brandy with all of the kids. What a breath of fresh air. From offering wine samples to giving her honest opinion on her personal faves and giving us substitution ideas for our picks, this woman had it all. What's better? Eric who brought us our food was delightful. Funny and engaging. Truly a wonderful experience. The food with substitution options came out great and we brought desserts home per Brandy's recommendations. I would buy anything from this woman.",

If it wasn't for the wonderful waiter I wouldn't give this place one star he was excellent, friendly and very attentive to a large crowd that we had. This is truly a restaurant that just caters to people in the hotel that may not have a car and cannot go out. It was very surprising that on a Friday night there was not many people in there at all but that did not surprise us after we ate there would not recommend it. And a word to the waiter go find a place that would appreciate your service, you did an excellent job and you should be in a restaurant that people appreciate not only the good service but good food."

   "This was my first stop and I loved this place. We found the food excellent and the staff to be warm, friendly and accommodating. We'll definitely be adding this place as a regular stop on our trips to concord",
   "The best chicken in NH hands down, whenever I'm asked \"do you wanna get lunch\" my go to is Wow Chicken. Can't say enough good things and also a great way to try different and new food that always impresses my mouth! Don't think about it just go or order out for yourself and make sure you order the Wow homemade chicken tenders for the best results, your tummy will thank you for it!"

   "One of my preferred spots to eat. awesome location, well kept, and excellent customer service. 5 stars!",
   "I normally don't give out one star reviews. But this place has some serious improvement that needs to be done. It seems like the shell of something it used to be. Chicken didn't taste very fresh and it definitely was not crispy as described and there was way too much sauce! Broccoli was practically raw still and a lot of the food came out suspiciously quick. Place seems kind of beat down and it was very slow when I went in during lunch time.\n\nUpdate 7/26: Order Szechuan Shredded Beef and the beef tasted like it had spoiled. Wasn't the worst thing ever, but it waste definitely hard to miss and I sent it back. Fried rice was ok, but not very fresh either. Wonton soup was good.. They replaced my meal with the chicken version of it and it was much hotter, very fresh and tasted excellent!",

   "Was on my way back down to Nashua from a half day ski trip at Ragged Mountain.  This was a perfect stop to grab a sandwich (plus there\u2019s a gas station nearby).  The Caprese panini was perfectly toasted and tasty, though the extra order of fries that I got were just ok and somewhat overpriced at $4.",
   "I used to visit The Sandwich Depot pretty frequently back when they were occupying this space, so I'll admit that I was a tiny bit apprehensive of a replacement with \"bistro\" in the name. However, I liked the mix of items on the menu and the still very reasonable prices, so I tried them for lunch today. I got the caprese salad with tuna salad and let me tell you, it was one of the best lunches I've had in a while. A perfect antidote for when you want to come off the holiday excesses with a healthy but still tasty meal. The tuna salad was flavorful, with bits of dill and finely shredded carrots; the fresh mozzarella was super soft; the tomatoes juicy; and the spring mix had just the right amount of balsamic vinaigrette drizzled. I'll definitely be back to explore the other menu options!",

The food was good but it was an absolute mess that I wish the employee that made it would\u2019ve fixed the issue when they realized it was tore up. If they didn\u2019t realize it, then they shouldn\u2019t be working in customer service. Really disappointed.",

When 6:45 came and no phone or email that it would be delayed, I drove to the location where I asked if my order had left yet as my updated door dash said at restaurant. The woman and man at the front completely ignored me after they said they didn\u2019t know where my order was. I was standing right in front of the cash register and was blatantly ignored by TWO of the employees. I kept updating my browser and saw that it was in route to my home. I then proceeded to call the driver multiple times but kept getting sent to voicemail where a voicemail was not set up. When she arrived, she openly told my family that the order was cancelled and then sent for delivery. Not a phone call, email or update as to why our food was over 30 minutes late. I\u2019m appalled by the employees who ignored me right in front of my face while I was being very polite. I will be very careful when I enter this location again as they do not care what so ever about the actual customer.",

Usually takes just a couple minutes to get my meal, but this time it took nearly 25 minutes and when I got to go it wasn't the usual warm delicious turkey dinner like meal. Instead it was akin to a cold deli sandwich with cold stuffing and cold hard cheese. Even this gravy side was more gel than gravy. This isn't normal so I was very surprised and very disappointed. I don't know if they're just short-handed this is day or what but it was quite a let down.",

I took a bite of the sandwich and as I pulled away I saw the body of a bug on the edge where I would have taken my second bite. I get smaller bugs can sneak in (e.g., fruit flies) but this insect was almost the size of a quarter. It is alarming that the bug was right on the top of the coleslaw in plain sight NOT buried - so little care and observation was taken while preparing the food. Sorry B\u0101ked, this is unacceptable and I would be sickened if this happened to someone else."

So far, I've made it a point to try a different sandwich or wrap each visit, but I've become a big fan of The Warrior. Their chips are very unique, and very tasty. Pricing is also very competitive, although they could be charging twice as much as they do, and I'd still pay, since their food is VERY good. I highly recommend Wrap City if you need something quick and/or casual.",

I came with my family and everyone loved it. The food tastes amazing and is nice and fresh. The place was very clean and comfortable. I definitely recommend this and will be coming back.",
   "Friendly service. Clean restaurant and bathrooms. Delicious food with so many options and willing to make custom orders, too. The kettle baked chips are sprinkled with what tastes like a cinnamon sugar and is the most amazing taste combination. Cannot recommend enough. Always excited.to go back! Must try!!!",
   "Had the Philly\u2019s Best and it was terrific! Steak and toppings were amazing, the cheese wiz, although a bit much in places, was a nice addition to the overall taste. Chips were far better than the mass produced garbage from Lays. There are so many different things on the menu that I want to try, that I\u2019ll definitely be back! Can\u2019t wait to see this place grow and expand.",
   "Nice place, good food with excellent service, I did not find it on Instagram, I believe Google did not put the address.  recommend the venue"

   "The best chain pizza place ever. Totally affordable and great quality.",
   "Haven't been there in a while. Was a bit disappointed in the pizza. Not much cheese but more than enough sauce on the pizza. It may have just been the evening so I won't judge on this one trip. One other issue was they never called us up to the counter for pizza and when my daughter inquired they handed her a box saying it was her pizza, we were eating in, do she took it. While she was eating it she realized a customer was complaining because her pizza wasn't ready. My daughter looked down at the receipt on the box and it was the take out order box!",
   "Associates were great. Very pleasant. Great food.",
   "Food is good, however was informed this location will no longer honor any coupons from ads or their website.\n\nAt the current price points, I suspect this place will lose more customers.",
   "Place has gone way down hill. The entire company itself has. Food quality is way down from what it use to be. Also they cant even properly maintain there building."
