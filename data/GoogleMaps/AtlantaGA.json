   "A great spot to spend time with your family and/or friends.\n\nWe went early spring so not a lot of outdoor flowers however the indoor is amazing. The trails are all accessible friendly for people with special needs or stroller friendly. There are multiple waterfalls, many places where you can seat, a small coffee shop.\n\nWorthy if you do like nature and like to invest in your health",
   "The Atlanta Botanical Garden is nestled firmly within Piedmont Park in a convenient, yet compact setting. The gardens and decor are unique and contemporary, perfectly complementing the midtown skyline that serves as the backdrop. The canopy walk is a fun, relaxing experience that extends the garden\u2019s footprint. The Orchid Daze exhibition was fantastic, and worth the large crowds. That being said, the parking garage, entrance, and walkways are small throughout the garden, and can feel at capacity rather quickly. The large weekend crowds can make the experience somewhat stressful as the garden is small for a city of this size.",
   "What a beautiful, peaceful oasis. Perfect for lovers of nature. A breath of fresh air hidden within the bustling streets of downtown Atlanta. Just kept getting better the more we walked and explored the grounds. The green houses were my favorite. Definitely a MUST-SEE!!!!",
   "Lovely garden adding a pleasant bit of fitness to your day. Lots to learn in a very pleasant and delightful environment.\nThe frogs and orchids were a real delight, also enjoyed all the sculptures outside including the Earth Goddess. The children\u2019s section had so many happy teeny tots, a real delight to watch. The desert zone, skyline, canopy walk, edible garden etc added their own charm to the place.\nLooking forward to visiting again in spring and see the place in full bloom. Also, the volunteer opportunities are enormous- looking forward to sign up for a few to learn, serve and grow.\nI would highly encourage this place for all nature enthusiasts.",
   "Gorgeous botanical gardens. They have such nice grounds to browse through.  I love the sculpting of the plants and bushes that they do. It is really a nice time to walk around. They have little cafes inside to so you can grab a coffee and enjoy. This is not something that I would have normally done but quite glad I did!"

   "World of Coca Cola is something that everyone should take a look at when visiting Atlanta. They have a great deal of exhibitions discussing the history of Coca Cola which are fascinating. There are many rooms that display Coca Cola memorabilia. You are even able to view the secret vault where the recipe for Coca Cola is located. The visual effects of each exhibit are stimulating and fun. There are many spots for good photos such as with the Coca Cola polar bear. I especially loved the exhibit where you are able to taste test different flavors from around the world. My favorite flavors were the watermelon ones and the sour apple ones. The staff were all very friendly and informational. They show you a commercial for Coca Cola and it is very heartwarming. The gift shop is enormous with some awesome items such as glasses in all sorts of colors, a variety of keychains, and some very cute clothes. There is even an exhibition where you can view how they produce Coca Cola. The whole experience really shows you how Coca Cola brings people together from all walks of life. I would highly recommend this as a must see on your trip to Atlanta!",
   "We paid for the VIP tour and our Steve tour guy was awesome.  Good pace, very interesting, lots of history and deliciousness.  At the beginning of the tour you get a coke zero or whatever drink you want, you get to see a lot of antiques and take picture with the polar bear.  You get to go in the vault were they have the secret recipe, you get to see the bottling process.  I got a lot more than expected.  The headsets that you use are very comfortable and super clean, you get a souvenir at the end of the tour.  You get to taste a lot of different coca colas around the world.",
   "I called with a question after I bought my tickets and the person on the other end was both polite and friendly. I had a friend visiting from out of town and we went to visit the World of Coke together, him for the first time and me for the first time in about a decade. We did a self guided tour which allowed us to take in the exhibits at our own pace. However the staff are very courteous and ready to answer any questions you may have whether you are on an official tour or not. There are a good number of things to interact with and cater to the attention of children while for adults. There is plenty of history/nostalgia to read about/view in the various display windows. The drink tasting was as exciting as I remember it being from all those years ago and I would certainly recommend the World of Coke to anyone who hasn't been or hasn't been in a while.",
   "Great on the history of Coca-Cola and the original secret formula is in a gigantic vault.  Fun experience in an area where you can taste soft drinks from all over the world.  Model area that shows bottling process.  But no actual Coke is made here.  Good gift shop.  Impressive concern for recycling.",
   "I visited the world of Coke. Lots to see. Lots of facts about coke. I got an annual pass. That will pay for itself on my next visit. You can spend 3 to 4 hours there, to see everything. There is lots of taste testing of coke products around the world. America, Asia, Europe.. All over ...This is a must taste place to see. Museum is high quality learning and entertainment. The history of Coca Cola is amazing. The taste tasting center at the end of the tour is the highlight for me. The gift shop is the last place to see."

   "I live in the city centre and I am lucky to be able to live a few steps from Piedmont Park. Whether it is dogwood celebration or free yoga, there are always events in the park. Even on quiet Tuesdays, I like to play in the park-it's big, every inch is beautiful. Personally, I like to sit on a rocking chair and enjoy the view of the water. Nothing compares to a beauty plus a good book. If you come to us, be sure to take the time to play in our lovely park. You will not regret it. In the summer, there are free concerts at the Park Bar at sunset.",
   "I love this park. It\u2019s so much space for everyone. If you come here it wouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary to see people skating, on their bikes, riding electrical scooters (that you can usually find in the park through third parties) parents with their kids etc. this park is massive and beautiful. It\u2019s next to the botanical garden and the parking there is very affordable.",
   "It is truly one of my favorite places to go. Large, beautiful and peaceful surroundings. Always plenty of families and individuals enjoying the park's amenities. If you live nearby it's a great place to jog, picnic, stroll or simply take a few pictures. If you're driving into the community you'll appreciate the low cost parking. Either way the park has something for everyone.",
   "Its very beautiful and big. If your ever in the mood for a good jog or walk, this is the park for you. It also has a children's park with swings and a slide. Not only do they have a place for you and your kids, they have a place for your dog too! They have a really nice fenced in area for your dog to run freely and have fun. It's a huge park that has something for everyone. Try it out, you'll probably like it.",
   "Fantastic, huge park. Great place to go and watch someone destroy themselves on a bird scooter. Lots of room to skate, walk, ride a bike (and apparently unicycle). Every one smiles and waves, great vibes. There's also a dog park/training school that looks nice. There's something for everyone at this park."

   "I loved this place.  It was a very nice and neatly kept up zoo.  I loved the animal enclosures and couldn't believe how close you got to some of the animals, like the lemurs.  I would recommend this Zoo to anyone.  I also loved the fact that the zoo admission was included in a city pass booklet.  Being a tourist I loved that the zoo was included in the city pass booklet as it gave me options on where to visit while in Atlanta.  Loved the zoo and would recommend it to anyone.",
   "We had a great time. We got lucky with the beautiful sunny but cool day and it wasn't crowded! My 3 year old twins were able to see the animals that were out without a hassle. We rented a double stroller and it made it easier for us. A lot of the animals weren't out because of the cold but overall it was a good time. We weren't able to see everything but saw all we were excited to see. The petting zoo seemed cool and the kids area ( we didnt stay there) . My girls loved the tiger,  monkeys and panda. The only thing I wish is that the sensory material was available inside the park instead of outside the main entrance. Luckily,  since it wasn't crowded or loud, we didn't need them. I did see the designated quiet areas around the park. It is a great option for those who  need it. Will definitely be going back.",
   "Great zoo, tons of variety, and the new elephant exhibit is fantastic. Good use some maintenance of the parking (gets muddy anytime it rains) but parking is free so I cant complain too much. Food is pricey but quality is good for 'theme park food'. Plenty of opportunities to get close to the animals and the staff is friendly. The zoo is kept clean throughout the day.",
   "Loved the Atlanta Zoo!! The exhibits were well kept and the grounds were very nice, too.  The staff were all friendly and the restrooms were clean. The staff stopped and talked to me, and they seemed to genuinely love their jobs. I had a great time and it wasn't too crowded (granted I went on a Friday but it was after a weeks worth of rain). I loved the gorilla exhibit. It was spacious, peaceful and the gorillas were amazing to watch.",
   "We had a great experience. We\u2019ve been to bigger zoos,  but this one is a great size.  With lots of animals and not to much walking. Nice train, petting zoo and play areas for children. We did not buy food, so I cannot comment on the prices. Shows and educational are scheduled throughout the day. The grounds were clean and well maintained. They were just finishing up on their beautifully designed elephant display.  Parking could be an issue (long walk) if you don\u2019t arrive early. Fun day for the family."

I\u2019ve been to a lot of escape rooms and most of them didn\u2019t had a intro video to show what you will be doing in the room like this place. Great location to get some food and drinks to celebrate afterwards. Can\u2019t wait to go back!",
   "This is one of the best escape rooms if ever been to! We did The Heist where we had to recover a Monet painting. The room was expertly decorated and designed. The puzzles were also very well done. There was only one puzzle that even with hints, didn\u2019t really make sense. You can tell The Escape Game has thought of everything when it comes to escape rooms. The staff was very nice. They also let you get a sneak peak of a room if you can\u2019t decide which one you want to do. Overall it was a wonderful experience and will definitely be going back to try the other escape rooms!",
   "A must-do in Atlanta! The Escape Game has the greatest escape rooms! All of their rooms are AMAZINGLY themed (it\u2019s like Disney World level), and the challenges are so unique & engaging. Every room has something that I would never expect to find in an Escape Room (especially Spec Ops!) And because the rooms have varied puzzles & challenges, every person on our team got a chance to solve something! I\u2019ve loved all 5 of their games, but Gold Rush is my favorite! \nAlso shout-out to their Game Guides & the whole team, they are so fun & helpful! If you\u2019re not sure which game you\u2019ll like best, just ask em!",
   "This is the best escape game company hands down. Their puzzles are challenging in a fair way. There aren't any \"trial and error \" puzzles that sink your time. If you know the answer to something, you are instantly rewarded with a fun surprise in the environment. My favorite part is how seamlessly the puzzles blend with the atmosphere. Everything feels like it belongs and it makes you feel truly part of the experience.",
   "Totally didn\u2019t think Playground would be nearly as fun or challenging as it was, but whoa baby! This is a super fun room with twists and turns and it\u2019s hard to believe they rank it 6/10! Check it out! Cody & Caleb were awesome!!"

   "Nice cozy atmosphere. Pretty good view from all seats, from what I could tell. Got through the gates pretty fast, especially for a really large crowd. Leaving was not too horrible, had to do the shoulder to shoulder shuffle until the crowd broke up outside the main entrance. An enjoyable venue for shows. I will definitely go back to see other shows/concerts there.",
   "The Diana Ross concert at the Fox Theatre was OUTSTANDING!  Diana's voice was clear and strong (especially for her being 75 years old).  The theatre's acoustics were fantastic for the band and singers.  The ushers were very polite and helpful.  The seats were comfortable.  The bathrooms were clean and the concessions were reasonable.  It was a perfect night at The Fox!",
   "I absolutely adore the Fox Theatre!!! \ud83d\ude0a As a little girl, my Grandpa Bubba would take me to the Fox Theatre to see The Nutcracker and I cherish those precious memories that I'll hold in my heart forever. Last weekend, my boyfriend and I went to see Little Big Town at the Fox and it was a phenomenal performance. The Fox Theatre was clean, gorgeous, and a true work of art, just as I had remembered it. Definitely go see a play or concert at the Fox if you have the chance. It's such a unique and special experience! \u2728",
   "It is a beautiful historic theater with elegant and exotic design. It is like being in a middle eastern temple under a night sky. It has a one of a kind atmosphere and is outstanding for concerts. For being in the heart of Atlanta, it has the high class atmosphere one would expect, but also a magnificant beauty that really stands out.  Based on it's grand architecture and historic legacy, I would highly recommend it as a standout venue ( among the many in Atlanta) to attend for entertainment.",
   "Went to see Alvin Ailey and the show was great. I will say the cost for parking next door to the Fox is quite expensive ranging from $30-40. It's convenient but come on is $40 really necessary? I was happy that they offered snacks and drinks and of course you will pay a nice fee for that as well. Overall, it was a great show even though I still spent an additional $60 for parking and snacks."

   "$15 admission cost is a ridiculous price to pay to go to one of the most well known art museums, and located in such a convenient spot in midtown Atlanta. Please do come here at least once in your life if you live in or near Atlanta, I enjoyed every story of the building as well as the multiple open exhibits that are accessed via elevator.  The entire vibe around and outside the museum is great as well, with aesthetically pleasing architecture. Going to come here again for sure.",
   "I love everything this museum has to offer. From the sculptures, paintings, or special exhibits. We spent many hours appreciating the art on display.\n\nDefinitely a great place to visit in the city if you're a lover of the arts.\n\n**You can't enter the museum if you buy a coffee or food. I wasn't paying attention to their signs when I first got there and had to throw my coffee away. Just a reminder**",
   "Good art, good for college students, long-term relationship's dates, and lovers of art. Plenty of walking and some more mature themes so not great for little kids. Interesting exhibits and lovely tour guides. Fun gift shop and useful coffee shop.",
   "I've never been to an exhibit here that was disappointing. The museum is beautiful. Love the refresh they did on their permanent exhibit, and love Second Sundays! I do wish they were open a little later. The only downside to the museum is the price of parking. But I mean, hey - it's Atlanta. Definitely try to take MARTA as there's a station right by the museum. Also, if you go into the gift shop as an exhibit is wrapping up, the exhibit-specific merchandise typically has a pretty steep discount. Did that for Infinity Mirrors ;)",
   "Third time back at the High.  This time for their Frequency Fridays. This is such a beautiful art museum with great exhibits.  Great dining options from coffee bar ( serving cocktails) to cafe to fine dining at Twelve Eighty."

   "My husband and I went here as part of our Valentine's Day weekend! It was absolutely spectacular! I knew I would be impressed, but wow! If you are a Jim Henson fan, GO! It was amazing seeing some of my favorite characters, from The Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal.",
   "Always a great time at this museum! I love how I can see several different puppets each visit as they rotate the exhibits about twice a year. The guided tour is very much worth the price of admission but just going through on your own is quite enjoyable too! A great place to take out of town guests - especially if they are Jim Henson/Muppet fans!",
   "I have always loved the Center and have taken my children there for 20 years now. However we went on a recent field trip (reduced rate is good) and saw Stellaluna. The play, though good enough in itself, was performed in an overt style (seeing the puppeteers in the open) was disappointing. I'm an adult and I know there are people working the puppets. I just don't want to see them, watch their mouths move along with the puppets' mouths and see them as part of the performance. The smaller children there didn't seem to mind, but mine were disappointed...and so was I. The regular ticket price is a bit much at $25. Try to set up a field trip with 10 or more and it's about half price, including a make a puppet workshop. It can be quite unorganized in the workshop if a lot of children are participating, so ask for the puppet kit to go if you're a loner, have several small children to help or strapped for time. They are always fun and usually include all you need to complete it at home. For educators or home-schooled families, there are usually resources and extra related info on the website, or within the program leaflet. Also, a coordinator can give you more info on resources as well.",
   "It was an awesome place. They have interactive displays along with some historical information on puppetry. We loved the Stellaluna puppet show, it was fun for kids and adults. It was easy enough to get to with GPS and they also have a few benches and tables outside that made it great for a small picnic. All in all a fun and intriguing place to go",
   "Just visited yesterday to see the Dark Crystal exhibit and truly this was a very memorable museum experience. The staff was incredibly helpful and nice, and overall I'm stunned how much there is too look at with the admission price. The Jim Henson exhibit really made me feel nostalgic and I was in awe seeing those puppets in person! The Dark Crystal exhibit was above and beyond, I am still so thrilled I got to see these puppets in person! In my opinion, this museum is a must do if you are in Atlanta!"

However, when it came to the employees level of attitude, kindness, and helpfulness, you were either great or horrible. Some employees treated us like little kids while we were there pushing us around or being forceful. Some were just rude. The other half of employees were amazing. It's a cool place to visit. Recommended spending about 2 hours here.",
   "Just wanted to drop you a line to say thank you to the amazing staff at College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta for making my visit an exceptional and memorable experience. As a classical pianist and first generation American with parents who never watched any traditional American sports, I am probably one of the least likely people to ever visit any sports facility or hall of fame. I think it's safe to say that I never would have gone if I weren't dragged in by my friend.\n\nWOW - what a wonderfully interactive and fun experience it ended up being! I felt welcome. from the moment I walked in and was warmly greeted by Evin. The personalization of displays throughout my trip through the museum made it that much more fun, and I was fascinated by the exhibits about the people, philosophy, and history of the sport. From the analogies to training for life (which I can relate to as a musician), to the evolution of technology  in gear and safety equipment, to the motivational film that actually got me excited to attend a game in the future, to the chance to test my speed, vertical jump, and finally throw and kick on the field, I enjoyed every moment and left the building with an ear-to-ear grin. Consider me a fan!\n\nThank you to all,\nElizabeth",
   "This was where my boyfriend and I had our first official date. It's a great place to be in a relaxed environment and to learn college football facts and history. You can bring your camera and take picture and there is a lot of memorabilia that you can photograph. This place is very family friendly.  Wear comfortable shoes, as you will do a lot of walking in this multi-level facility. Overall you will enjoy!",
   "If you are a college football fan, this is a must see attraction in Atlanta.  Even if your not a CFB fan, I think you will have a great time. This is a great way to spend time as a family in Atlanta.  Our 7 year old and 10 year old had an amazing time. They loved the interactive activities like the vertical jump and 40 yard dash. And of course they loved the chance to kick a field goal and run some receivers routes. Spent about four hours there and could have stayed longer.  Can\u2019t wait to visit again!",
   "I'm not a big fan of sports in general but this place was impressive. Larger than I thought from looking at it outside. They have a small theater, many displays and attractions. Also interactive exhibits like record your own commentary of a famous play, be in a televised broadcast as an announcer, measure your vertical leap, ride in the good year blimp, and kick your own field goal. It is attached to the Omni hotel for an easy walk there."

I would definitely recommend being 30-40 minutes early to the dolphin show or you won't get a seat. We barely missed getting seats.",
   "Very big one. One of the finest aquariums I have visited. Dolphin show was superb. I usually avoid these shows because they torture dolphins. But this was great. Felt dolphins liked it. Handled by professionals. Great job.",
   "There are various aquatic displays and creatures to see. It is a great experience for anyone that hasn't been. Tour organization could be a little better as far as someone giving suggestions on a path to take from beginning to end, but free exploration is great too. Touch exhibits are a great inclusion of the aquarium, just make sure to listen and follow the instructions of the guide at the exhibit for your safety and the safety of the creatures. This is a place to take the kids or just a romantic date. There are room in some exhibits for strollers and scooters for those that need them. There are also elevators for access to the second floor. The dolphin show was an awesome experience to be a part of as well. This is definitely a place you need to check out at least once.",
   "Such a beautiful place! The exhibits are huge and set up to accurately represent the natural environment of the organisms living in them. There's this tunnel, completely made of glass, that crosses through one of the largest tanks in the aquarium. Here you can see all different kinds of sharks, fish, and even the whale shark swimming right over your head. It's magical! It's also a great place to take kids, where everyone in the family can have a good time.",
   "This was worth a visit and the cost. I have seen a few shows and movies that were filmed at this aquarium and it was SO cool to be able to see the whale shark exhibit so close in person. It was a beautiful experience and there is nothing quite like it. Their research also speaks to their progressive efforts of sustainability and conservation. I love learning about their rehabilitation of animals in general. Definitely will be going back."

   "As someone that loves aviation this place is amazing. The 747 is full of history and so iconic, it was just amazing to get into the first queen of the skies that was built for passenger use and flew for 30 yrs she has history in every corner! Everyone here was amazing and very helpful! If you use Google maps to get here it will tell you to make a left at the very end of the instructions on how to get there but it's wrong, just keep straight for another 8th of a mile and the actual place will be on the left. You can see the hangar that says Delta flight museum. Stop at the front where the guards are, they will check your Id give you a parking pass and give you stickers that read Delta museum guest. Find a parking Spot put the stickers on yourself and walk into the brick building to the right of the first big hangar it has landing gear posts on the outside of it. Go in and the building through security get your passes and hit the 747 before you go in as I closes earlier than the building. Also they have guided Douglas DC-3(Ship 41) tours every second Tuesday of every month, for a very short time so make sure to call before and be there. This place is awesome for young ones and parking is free!!! You can also see incoming and outgoing traffic in the airport from the parking lot which is a big plus for me! There's a fully working B737 simulator in there that costs a little over 400 bucks for an hour for up to 4 people if I'm not mistaken check the website for the details and have some fun. Plan to be here 2 to 3 hours for an in depth visit!",
   "I\u2019ve been to Atlanta a lot in my life and just now stopped in to see the Delta flight museum.  It was a good way to pass an extra hour or so.  Most of the exhibits are interesting.  It\u2019s cool to see a 747 and go upstairs, but it would have been even cooler to have that upstairs be retrofitted back to the swanky days of flying, rather than just see it full of \u201cDelta One\u201d Business Class seats.  The 767 is a bit more interesting because it still has parts of the cabin from the 80s and has that vintage smell.  Not quite on par with the Museum of Flight in Seattle, but not bad.",
   "Not too many exhibits but there\u2019s a rare Waco 125 which is very nice. The DC-3 is gorgeous too. Very well presented and lots of Delta memorabilia to see. The shop is well stocked. Would be great if they had a cafe or restaurant. Check out the cool Mini in the car park too!",
   "Very cool place for aviation fans. Learned some cool trivia. They have a 747 and another plane you can walk through. They also have a 737? Full on flight simulator for extra cost. It costs $15 each but half off for military and Delta employees/guests groups of up to 25 can get in for $100 so that's a cool deal too.",
   "Perfect for an avgeek or just persons with interest in the topic to spend a few hours. Various exhibits from the whole history of this airline, of which many are planes, of course (including a 747 and a 767 which you can explore from their inside). Nice gift shop, too, with a good choice of items and fair prices. Take the information provided with a grain of salt, though, as it is (obviously) a corporate museum.\nThe museum is located in the Delta HQ. That means there is no separate entrance for it; you just go through the regular gate, get your ID checked and receive a sticker saying you're a museum visitor."

   "Krog street tunnel is always worth a look at, if not for the art, but for the fact that it's the biggest headache trying to turn under/into going left  headed down Decatur St that I have ever had the displeasure of attempting in Atlanta, and every time I am there, at least three people are either going to run the red light, or attempt to run the light only to slam on their brakes at the last minute.\n\nIt's really best to visit on foot. It's a pretty iconic spot in Atlanta, and while it's not quite at the landmark level of the Big Chicken, most people at least know OF it, if not exactly how to get there.",
   "I am always happy whenever I find myself traveling in through & around this vicinity. The creativity that lives in the air & atmosphere always seems to draw my attention.  Artsy, vibracious, colorific, cool, fun...list of adjectives goes on! Love it!",
   "Holy Cow! This place is INSANE! So much to look at and a really cool place to take pictures! \ud83d\udcf7  It was definetly worth the 40 minute walk. Also fun fact; Tori Kelly's 'It Should've Been Us' has parts of the tunnel in her song. Kinda cool \ud83d\ude0e",
   "The Krog street tunnel was an amazing stop to visit not being from Atlanta this tunnel was a site to see and if you're an artist this is a must see. So many different styles of artistry that you will be there for at least 30 minutes to an hour looking at this amazing display of creativity."

   "There were some really cool exhibits, my favorite being about handmade crafts in Atlanta/Georgia. Emory\u2019s Laney Graduate School hosted its annual gala there and the setting was good. There were lots of places to take pictures.",
   "I enjoyed my first experience at the Atlanta History Center. This is a great place to see the history in plain view. My kids enjoyed themselves as well but my most enjoyable moment was the play about \"John Lewis's speech\".",
   "Very disappointing...Took friends from out of town to the new location as we have always had great feedback from visitors that we have taken to the old location. We were so looking forward to this and couldn\u2019t have been more let down, no theater or narration, the story of the battle is gone and so is the ability to sit and be told a story. It\u2019s like the museum purposely decided to take the heart out of the attraction. Embarrassed to have had guests pay $21.50 each to listen to a guy with a laser flashlight point out random images on the canvas.  Won\u2019t go back...they really ruined it.",
   "My family and I really enjoyed the Atlanta History Museum.  There were some really neat exhibits and some really amazing stories and artifacts! I loved the fact that they have the Swan House and Smith Family Farm as a part of the museum.  I did feel like there could have been more in certain areas and that they could have delved deeper into much of the history of Atlanta.  I wasn\u2019t able to see the 360*? Part of the museum but will definitely go back to experience that!  If you love Museum or don\u2019t have a lot of experience with them this is a really good place to start!",
   "Relaxing and fun place.\nThe history center is great to come and spend a leisure Sunday.\nThings to do, food to eat, and tons and amazing things to see.\nThere is admission to the museum.\nBut I think it is worth it."

   "I. Can\u2019t. Even. This was so fun and so informative for a stranger things fan!!!!  My son (12) and I went to celebrate his birthday - we had a blast. So so many great stops where the show was filmed!  Kevin the tour guide was hilarious and so great at telling us all the insider scoop and Mike was a fantastic driver. We had a blast!!!!",
   "Atlanta Movie Tours designed a custom private tour for our group of about 20. These family members spanned 3 generations.   The tour included locations for shows like Walking Dead and Stranger Things for the younger ones, plus Baby Driver and Driving Miss Daisy for the older set. In addition we enjoyed a delicious lunch and challenging escape rooms. The entire experience took nearly 5 hours. It was absolutely top notch in all respects. As we drove from place to place our guides (Colin and Sydney) shared several entertaining stories about their stints as film extras. Both kept us informed and entertained the entire time. We arranged the tour with Anna, who cheerfully made several last minute adjustments at our request. Her flexibility and quick responses to changes could not have been better. I would recommend Atlanta Movie Tours to anyone seeking first class entertainment about TV shows and movies filmed in the Atlanta area.",
   "Great tour for all Stranger Things fans! Enough time for pictures and very well curated! This tour is not only for the Upside Down fans but for all the attendees and movie lovers. Colin, Mike and the entire crew are fantastic, and the bus is very comfortable and well driven and navigated. Will definitely recommend if you happen to be in Atlanta.",
   "My wife and I went on the Best of Atlanta today, and Mike and Kevin made it a trip to remember. There were movie locations and facts galore, reroute due to a marathon, and even a warehouse fire to round out the trip. Kevin and Mike took everything in stride and made it a tour to remember.\n\nNext time we're back in Atlanta, we'll come back and do another tour for sure. And I'll be recommending this to anybody I know who comes to Atlanta.\n\nThanks for a great time guys!"

Easy to park, and a short stroll in takes you to another world of wild animals in well-kept habitats, fun rides on a carousel or a train, and a great challenge involving harnesses that we'll tackle next time! Plenty of places to snack or rest and enjoy the shade. Local favorite. Well worth it. Arrive early!",
   "A noble idea of creating a clean and safe space for city goers to relax or exercise. I enjoyed walking even at night while my daughter and wife enjoyed taking a walk.",
   "In my opinion it's a really pretty park not one I would bring young kids to but maybe older kids  or a significant other there's a really nice bridge and your close to water. It could be a really romantic setting. In my defense I didn't explore some of the park so I could of missed some stuff but it's still really nice",
   "Great zoo. One of the best I've ever seen. Kept very clean. A few animals missing which I know they are either being cared for or hiding but seemed like quite a few. With that said lots of expansions happening and remodeling so I will definitely return in a few years to check it out again. Worth the trip.",
   "Amazing zoo! The price is well worth it, the variety of animals is great! It took my party which included a little one about two hours to see everything. The playground was great for the little ones and gave everyone a break from walking while they exhausted themselves. I can't wait for the new exhibits coming in the coming months!"

   "A great view of the downtown from the top of the Sky-view. A great ride! This is really lovely experience here with amazing view.Loved it.Overall I would definitely recommend it. Attentive and fun staff - well managed; cabins are secure and air conditioned; ride was 4 rotations which was about 15 min long. The pods that you ride in are quite roomy, they are enclosed and have huge windows and the view is fantastic! The ride also takes you around several times so you have a long time to enjoy yourself! Perfect ending to a romantic date. Highly recommend coming right as the sun is setting. The view from the very top is amazing. Ticket prices are reasonable and the time you get to ride is reasonable too.",
   "My wife and I took a ride on our date! We got to see such a spectacular view of Atlanta after dark. Everything around us was lit up. It was beautiful. The best part is that we were in a nice, cozy space when we rode around, it made our date feel more special.",
   "Nice ride and worth the money. This is accessible to people in wheelchairs who may take their wheelchair within the car. The only negative is that not all the lights were working and it would\u2019ve been prettier with all the lights working. I will ride this again",
   "We had an amazing experience with my son at the SkyView Ferris wheel. It\u2019s a great thrill while you get to enjoy the great views of Downtown Atlanta. The cabins were maintained clean and provided enough room for us. I really recommend this to families and while at this location will also enjoy great food and drink. The entire experience is worth the price.",
   "This Ferris wheel is iconic; you always see it on TV when there's a game in Atlanta.  That makes it worth doing in my book.  And yes the views were great!  I took off two stars because (1) my daughter is in middle school, but they wouldn't give her a student discount (excuse us for not knowing her student ID was needed on a short vacation), and (2) I don't like mandatory photo poses."

A must see attraction where there is so much to explore and informative. The dolphin show was amazing. Gazing the large tank with the soothing music played in the background made me feel like I was in a dream world. Amazing place. Would love to visit again.",
   "Its a very ordinary aquarium, but very crowded as it is in the middle of Atlanta. Besides the large window in the picture (very cool), I didn\u2019t see anything special since I rather see animals in something resembling their habitat instead of shows forcing them to do tricks. Good place to take kids though. I think it would be a 4 star for kids, easily.",

There was definitely more than enough to come back several times or spend a very long day at the history center for those who really dig this kind of place.",

   "Dope I love seeing how rich people used to live.  There was a wedding taking pictures outside it's a great place for pics for sure",
   "Beyond neat! Stepping into the house you immediately feel like you're a part of history and almost like deja vu because it's so well preserved...nothing was missing. Even an iron board within the maid's room was left standing for realism. Her personal decor with memories of loved ones. Was like visiting someone and you were waiting for them to walk back into the room. The front entrance is of grandeur with a beautiful water fountain. The black and white checker floors was a treat to witness. Lounging in an outside area that's not easily noticed from the drive way. It's definitely worth seeing again to have the information ingrained.",
   "Swan house is beautiful time capsule that takes you through early 20th century daily life of a wealthy Atlanta family. The house is well maintained and fits the beautiful landscape its built on. The rooms are magnificent and the grounds has one of the best examples of landscape stepped fountains in America. I loved exploring the place."

   "Krog Street Market is not necessarily as bustling or expansive as the Ponce market, but the offerings are still quite varied and tasty. I was surprised at the limited chicken places in here. Space to idle is limited, though they do have standing tables for you to eat your food at. Bathrooms are in the back, with particularly long lines for the ladies during peak times. Parking is packed.",

   "My kids absolutely love this place. It's one of very few places a kid can run and play without getting into trouble. It's hard for me to keep up. The reason for 4 stars is, this museum is for children. We, the adults/parents/caretakers are there to keep an eye on them and to make sure they are safe. We have to pay the same admission price as kids just to watch our own children. With that being said, we will surely return because the kids do love it.",
   "Pretty disappointed that the whole place was designed at best for kids up to about 8. A few tweaks like instructions for certain stations to explain how they are supposed to work would have helped (especially on the airflow setup with the plastic balls) definitely not remotely as good as the Indianapolis children's museum. This one resembles a cool playground much more than a place to learn and see cool things like the physics of gearing, hydraulics, air and electricity.",
   "We went for our younger daughter's 1st grade field trip. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and wanted to come back with their own family. The staff was excellent and made the experience even more fun. Our (Blue Crew) guide kept us all entertained and kept the kids focused at all the sections. Straight lines and answering quick math questions before we moved on. He did a great job. We definitely  will be returning at some point, at the request of our daughter.",
   "Great place to take your child. Its got so much for them to do and its educational! So they learn as they play. The museum is Huge, we've been twice now and we still have not seen and done everything there is. What's great also is that it's safe for kids, no adult is allowed in without a child and they require that you supervise your child throughout your time there. Definitely a place I would recommend getting a membership to, it'll save you a lot of $$ in the long run.",
   "Great place for kids.   Lots odd indoor activites for rainy days.   Besides just activities there are some with educational value but mostly things to do.   Some educational shows at 11 am and noon.   Membership is great if you live in Atlanta.   Place can keep your kids busy for 2-3 hours.   Being your own snacks for upstairs eating area."

   "The Michael C. Carlos Museum is an art museum located in Atlanta on the historic quadrangle of Emory University's main campus. The Carlos Museum has the largest ancient art collections in the Southeast, including objects from ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Near East, Africa and the ancient Americas. The collections are housed in a Michael Graves designed building which is open to the public. One of the oldest museums in Georgia, the museum's collections date back to 1876, when a general museum known as Emory College Museum was established on Emory University's original campus in Oxford, Georgia. After the university was relocated to Atlanta, a small group of professors officially founded the Emory University Museum in 1919. The collections were housed and displayed in various buildings around the campus. Over the years, Atlanta businessman Michael C. Carlos donated over $20 million to create a permanent home for the museum, which opened in 1985. The museum was renamed again to the Emory University Museum of Art and Archaeology and was officially accredited by the American Alliance of Museums as a museum of antiquities and fine arts. Carlos died in December 2002 at the age of 75. A major expansion in 1993 transformed the museum into one of Atlanta's top arts institutions. Upon the new building's opening, the museum became known as the Michael C. Carlos Museum, named after its most generous patron.",
   "Driving to parking deck was a breeze. The walk to the Museum short. The greeter near the entrance was so interesting that me and my Mom laughed and talked with her. The exhibits far exceeded my expectations. I can go every day for a week and not, ever, get bored. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, quiet and dressed to impress. The book store is equipped with topics that are amazing. To top it off there's Ebrik coffee and more. Yes I have to mention the Ladies rooms are sparkling clean.",
   "Went for an educator evening. High quality exhibit, and we were offered food and wine plus posters and other goodies. The collections represent a wide array of cultures throughout History. Highly recommend a visit!",
   "I went here to listen to great music at a kid friendly concert. Had a lovely time! :D Wasn't sure where to park though, so I parked at the hospital parking garage, which was a 15 min walk away :/"

   "ABSOLUTELY LOVE this location.  It is just SO BEAUTIFUL.  I have been to many a cemeteries throughout the United States over the years, having photographed pretty much most of them, and the Oakland Cemetery ranks right near the top of the list for me.  \n\nAnd the staff that work there are BEYOND incredible.  Just ... WOW!  No matter when you go, they are just UNBELIEVABLE AWESOME!  Love Them Too. \n\nI am so glad I now live in the Atlanta area so I can go and walk the grounds whenever I get the chance.  Just a WONDERFUL experience.",
   "Hands down one of the prettiest  cemeteries I have seen; and no I\u2019m not someone who just marches around graves, but yes I have seen my share. \nThere is so much beauty here and many incredible pieces of history. \nThey have free audio tours which I would have enjoy had time not been a constant. \nI would go back with just me as I am the spooky one of the two of us in a second.",
   "Beautiful old cemetery with several gorgeous statues and mausoleums. The staff I spoke to were very friendly and extremely informative. Fantastic place to explore, take photos, or go for a jog. Parts of the cemetery are still going through restoration, which is unusual for many old cemeteries, as once the lots are filled and the city no longer funds it, the cemetery usually goes into ruin. We're very fortunate to have the Historic Oakland Foundation working hard to keep the grounds maintained and also to provide historical tours and information on the cemetery.",
   "Want a downtown walk outside the hustle and bustle of Atlanta?  Try Oakland Cemetery.  Beautiful, historic, and pleasant.  You\u2019ll find something different with each visit and yet you will not tire of going back.",
   "The walk inside Oakland Cemetery is so nice and peaceful with some pretty great views of the city skyline. The aesthetically pleasing memorials, monuments, trees, and garden are what make this cemetery worth the visit. Such a great place to stop by if you're on Memorial Drive."

   "Serene and quiet, the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum sits nestled on a hill eliciting just the right amount of curious visitors. Gift shop prices are quite reasonable. There is a $12 fee to enter the museum, but I spent my time outside enjoying the Japanese garden which is free. My first time visiting a presidential center and quite neat.",
   "My husband and I visited Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum last Dec., we thought it will be a small museum, but we are so glad it is an excellent and large museum. There is a lot of good information/pictures/TV program about Mr. Jimmy Carter, especially his post-presidential life. We felt very encouraging by him. He is a man who is truly believing in God\u2019s words, and his actions shows that. Definitely worth the trip.",
   "This is great value for the $12 entrance fee! The place is laid out well, going through Carter's life from the beginning until now, so you can start out knowing nothing about him and come out feeling like an expert! There were few videos and most of the museum was signs to read, but it was interesting enough to keep our group engaged for 3 whole hours!",
   "Nice museum and not overwhelming with information and displays.  You can easily get through this in 2 hours. This is not a Democrats vs. Republican experience.  You truly leave with a sense of who Jimmy Carter was and what he accomplished in his four years in office and more importantly, what he did after he left after.  Worth the visit to see what a servant of the people really looks like.",
   "Truly a historical center leaving visitors inspired to go Be the Change in the World. I was a child when President Cater was elected and lived his life through the eyes of my grandmother. Out of the many places to visit on Atlanta, during a short visit, my daughter  and me choose this place of recorded legacy. The beauty of faith, diplomacy, family, favor, unity and love for America brought tears of hope to my eyes. The staff were just as beautiful asking what I felt after the tour. Jimmy Carter...Thank you for your service. You did good for America and God bless you and your family."

   "I really loved visiting. It was great reflecting on the person he was and all that he accomplished at his young age. He was a man with a tremendous love for God and a deep desire to serve Him. I missed the tour of ML's childhood home because they were full for the day. Get your tickets early in the morning if you plan on visiting the house. Everything is free and there was plenty of parking. The place was clean and everyone was friendly and helpful. I spent about three hours there, watching the videos and taking everything in. It's a wonderful place and would love to come back.",
   "I was on vacation in Atlanta for a week. My partner and I decided to go into the city and explore. We went to this great plane, it was serreal that this is history. A great man was present there and I got to see it all with my own eyes. There is so much to see and discover, you could be there for a good few hours just looking and reading everything. The atmosphere was calm and it was a great plane to visit. Its all free and they have a little gift shop where you can buy little things. The tour guide did a great job, the information he shared was really good. Visit there if you can.",
   "Very interesting set of historical buildings in the area.  From the church the King Family pastor'd to the King Family House.  The King Birth House is a great tour if you can get tickets.  Tickets are limited and must be obtained at the Visitor Center first.  Then you get your tickets, from the visitor center, at the distribution time, then go on the tour.  Highly worth getting there promptly at 9am to ensure you get tickets.",
   "Great place for schools trip or family trip.  Very enlightening and educational.  Self explanatory so no official for needed. Could be emotional for older generations.  Would definitely return and recommend. My 11yr old found it extremely interesting.",
   "Amazing yet somber place. This is a great tribute to an even greater man.  Park staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We are already planning our trip back during the summer to see the roses in bloom."

The prices for admission, food and drinks were very reasonable. Our family had a wonderful time!",

   "My son and I got to the discovery center when they opened at 10, we were the only ones there for a while but the staff was very helpful and interactive. Jack especially made our visit great because he kept building my son different cars to race down the track when it was just us. I highly recommend it for anyone with little kids.",
   "Would give it 0 if possible.  Should have believed the negative reviews on google. We had tickets for 3PM, and when we got there they told us that we're had till 3:30pm because someone was having a private party. They apologized, but wasted my time and my kids time. We did not have time for anything. DO NOT GO! Use the money in something else and something better. We had a party of six and paid for all the tickets ourselves.  It was between monster jam and Lego land. With the money we spent we could have bought the kids as many Lego toys as they wanted.",
   "Fun place for kids 4-12. There are Lego themed activites, rides, shows, and playground. Like an upscale Chuck E Cheese. The entertainment time is about 2-3 hours. Makes for good place for a birthday party. It is well lit with vibrant colors which makes is a good place to go to \"lighten-up\" during the cold gloomy winter days. They pay attention to all the details including the re-entry hand stamp."

   "I have visited the Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church on several occasions over the years.  I highly recommend everyone take the opportunity to visit this site should you be in the Atlanta area.  There is no cost of entry or to park; I have always been able to find a parking spot close by.\nOn one occasion we were able to sit in on a live presentation by one of the Park Rangers who attended Ebenezer Baptist at the same time as Dr King.  This was, by far, our most memorable visit.  On our most recent visit, however, the ranger informed us that such presentations no longer take place.  \nIt is incredibly inspirational to be in the very church where Dr Martin Luther King, Jr grew up and preached.  Dr King\u2019s message of unity and peace is clearly demonstrated in the church and park on the same grounds.\nThe only criticism I have is I have encountered several other visitors who have been much less than friendly.  It seems Dr King\u2019s message of love and acceptance are not necessarily ascribed to by everyone who visits.  \nAll said, this site is a MUST VISIT!",
   "Very cool piece of history.  The basement as a few areas of information and exhibits.  It is also where the bathroom is located.  The main congregation area was great to just sit and absorb.  Highly recommend it.  It is free, does not take very long but is very important and moving.",
   "Really enjoyed service here last Sunday. Famous churches like this run the risk of feeling more like a tourist attraction than a place of worship but the focus was squarely on the word. Outside homage is paid to its famous former pastor, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but inside you know you are in a church. Would love to return on my next visit to Atlanta.",
   "Visiting this church will change your life! To see the actual pulpit where Dr. King preached from, to kneel in the pews that his congregation knelt in was the highlight of my trip to Atlanta. They have historic sermons playing inside the church which made it even more memorable. \nThe staff were very helpful. Clean bathrooms! \nI took the subway train and walked to the area. I made an afternoon of visiting area by going to the MLK National Historic Park and visitors center, visited the church, and then went to the cemetery by the train station. Signs everywhere ask tourists to not give money to the panhandlers, and there were quite a few. I tried to stop in a bodega for a soda, big mistake, very scary. \nVisiting Ebenezer is absolutely worth the time and will make a trip to Atlanta more memorable!",
   "The order of service was excellent, and the breakfast before service was tasty with enough time to fellowship with others. The historic church was awe inspiring to say the least. They had a guest preacher when I visited. Grateful to see both the current and original church side by side. Much history to see and hear in this place. Highly recommend you to see both venues and read all there plaques."

   "I invited a group of friends to this experience to help celebrate my birthday on a Saturday night. Our Co-Pilot, Hannah, was very helpful and did a great job. My advice on how to conquer these experiences, especially like The Grand Zeppelin, is if you have a group of people, then split up. This way you save more time and will also have a better chance at getting all the clues. My group did not complete the experience in the 60 minutes allotted, but if we had 5 more minutes, then we would have. Regardless, everyone had a great time and said they would try another experience, which is great. The only complaint is the fact the A/C was off and the main room was a bit hot. So, it would be nice if  management would turn on the A/C on the weekends since the space is a bit confined.  Besides, this, if you're interested and want to try it, then I say go for it.",
   "This is one of the best rooms we have ever done (and we have done many).  The staff were super friendly.  The room was different from what we have done in the past, but definitely challenging.  We got out with 4.16 minutes to spare.  We will be back to try the others.",
   "For our son\u2019s 8th birthday, we did the Grand Zeppelin with Andrew. He effortlessly hosted our party of six loud and excited boys and four adults through this adventure. He was very patient with the kids while managing to stay in character.\nI found the game play to be challenging, but not impossible. The decor and set dressing were well thought out, with multiple layers that helped  sell the scene. There were some fun gadgets and unexpected surprises that provided a rewarding payoff.\nAfter the Grand Zeppelin, we retired to a party room which the staff had set up for us, complete with tables and tablecloths for both serving and sitting, chairs, balloons, decor, and the necessary trash can. We brought in pizzas, cupcakes, and some other snacks. The kids had fun and we wrapped up and headed out once they started popping all the balloons.\nMy son and his friends enjoyed the room and party. It was a rare kid\u2019s party where the parents can actually participate. The staff took care of all our needs and gracefully accommodated our rowdy crew of second graders. I would recommend this as a kids\u2019 party destination, and I\u2019d like to return without the kids to try the room again.",
   "Great place with well themed escape rooms!  Derek was awesome!  Highly recommend The Launch!",
   "We were staying in the downtown area while visiting family and always try and do an escape room wherever we're traveling to. Time to Escape definitely lives up to the great reviews - so much so that we decided to do two of the rooms in the same day! The Grand Zeppelin and The Launch were both phenomenal rooms - both in how well they were designed and decorated, and in how interactive, interesting, and infuriating (in a good way) all puzzles were! Jaryl was our in-room actor and our helpful robot arm for both rooms and made it so we had an absolute blast. The added element of playing a character in the room makes them even more fun.\nWould definitely recommend Time to Escape for anyone who loves escape rooms or someone who's looking for a place to start - these rooms are some of the best we've ever played and we wish we had more time in town to do their other rooms!"

I really enjoyed the opportunity to check up close every little detail of beading, embroidery and intricate designs. The museum team is very friendly and knowledgeable, they provide lots of information on the exhibition pieces. The view of Atlanta was a nice surprise for me!",
   "Outstanding Museum! An excellent place to see beautiful art ( collections of high end and unique fashion, sometimes photography exhibits) plus it is staffed with very knowledgeable staff and students that are accessible and answer questions.  A truly unique museum experience in a beautiful building.  Also probably the most inexpensive museum in Atlanta.",
   "I went on the to SCAD FASH and took advantage of the free admission thanks to the Second Sunday museum program. I\u2019m glad I went then because I would have been disappointed if I had paid to see one tiny exhibit. The Derrick Adams exhibit was neat, but I really wanted to see the Ala\u00efa pieces and was disappointed that the grand opening for that was the next day. Visitors could pop their head into the Ala\u00efa gallery, but it was still under construction. \n\nI will say that finding the parking garage was a headache, but once I was in, I was able to easily locate the entrance to the museum. The staff that was there that day were very friendly and helpful. I did love the views of Downtown Atlanta and the front of SCAD FASH is really unique. I would love to go again when the main exhibit is fully accessible to the public. \n\nFYI: they do not offer programs or details next to the individual pieces on exhibit. You must refer to their online guide or use one of the iPads they have available to visitors. I heard a few people grumbling about not knowing what they were looking at. Just ask one of the docents for help.",
   "The muesum had a nice assortment of clothing. They had a lounge area that showcased  jewelry made by students and a varying selection of memorabilia for purchase. They also have a huge TV with a short video on it that displayed a assortment of SCAD's different talent from video to fashion and beyond. I would have like to seen a little more diversity in the video. The museum is small but filled with wonderful pieces and student helpers that are eager to help. Will be back to view different collections.",
   "Interesting place to explore the multifaceted world of fashion. The exhibition 'Fashioning Art from Paper' is as disturbing as mesmerizing, and as a consequence, definitely a must-see. \nOn the down notes, pedestrian access is rather bad and this museum appears slightly over reliant on smart devices (e.g., no description of the pieces but a kind invitation to access the virtual exhibition to know more)."

   "The GREATEST escape room in Atlanta. The staff is awesome, our host Ronald will definitely have you intrigued in the activities they have to offer. He was a fantastic and phenomenal entertainer. I recommend if your in the area check it out you will not be disappointed by no means. Thanks Ronald for making our hooky day stress free your the best!!!!",
   "Came here for my husband\u2019s Birthday and we really enjoyed it. It was me, my husband, and our 3 kids. \n\nThe Zombie in a Room was so good!  The guy who played Dr. Oxy did excellent. Having someone in the room added an extra feature that made it awesome. I\u2019ve done multiple rooms but this was by far the best. \n\nWe escaped the room but the zombie helped us out some. My 11 year old son had a few scary moments but by the end of the game, he was good. \n\nI really recommend the zombie in a room experience.",
   "We went for a friends Birthday.  It was 6 of us and they added a couple to our group.  They meshed well with us. We ESCAPED the 80's.  It was sooooooo much fun.  Very challenging but we did it.  The orator was great too. He was pretty funny.  This place is highly recommended. I would love to go back and try the Criminal Minds Room.",
   "Played The Lost Sense. Love the theme! The hints were a little unprompted at some times, but most definitely warranted at others. Gamemaster Alex had a real knack for their character!",
   "Great escape room experience.  Staff is super helpful! We made it out with their help. Will definitely be back. They offer a few types of rooms.  Try the FBI theme."

   "Nice easy hike with several different trails to coffee from.  We don't about 2 hours here in our way back from Florida to b Tennessee.  It made a nice break from the interstate.  \nIf it had bathrooms I think I might have given it 4 stars.  But between having no bathrooms and moderately poorly marked trails we give it 3.",
   "I love this place. Very nice local trail. I take my son and his friends. Sometimes the dog! Once we begin our trek inside nearly everything around us becomes just quiet nature. Easy trail for any age. I even took my 80+ year old granmda! A few places to stop and take a rest along the way.",

The preserve is well maintained and populated so you don't have to worry about any issues with people bothering you.",
   "Gorgeous place! I arrived around 10 am and there were only a few people there but by the time I left (close to noon) the parking lot was full. It\u2019s a great place to take a short decent hike and enjoy the beautiful waterfall and scenery.",
   "I really did not enjoy this trail AT ALL. The trail was super short which was nice for a quick hike. However, it was a little creepy and dark. There was glass and trash which I wouldn\u2019t mind much but had my pup with me. Also, there were various people leaving fruit offerings which left a weird smell. Alsoooo, a witches convent meets there which was kinda interesting/cool"

   "The beginning of the mission was great.\nHad a lot of clues except the golf ball part. It shouldn't be in the game. \nEnding was short and kind of uneventful.\nFor the amount of people, the rooms are too small.\n8 people is just too much and the price they charge they really don't put into the effort of the clues or the set up of anything. \n\nThey also spam you with reviews until you unsubscribe or block them."

The staff are very helpful from buying a glass of wine or a bottle of water to helping you find your seat or giving directions to the restroom. The entire place is very clean including restrooms. The area to mingle before and after a performance is large enough to accommodate everyone without the feeling of being squished in somewhere. Hang on to your person after the show though as it's easy to lose someone in the crowd as everyone is leaving. Concerts, plays and ballet's are always perfectly run. The perfect place for some cultural entertainment for the whole family. Wheelchair accessible.",
   "Home to Symphony Hall, Alliance Theatre, and the High Museum of Art, which are all wonderful. The center is very pleasing to the eye and really stands out. There is an upscale restaurant on campus and a nice plaza at the center of everything, which often has some kind of art installation. Parking seems to fill up fast in the deck below the facility but there is another deck nearby and street parking if you're lucky.",
   "I go to this venue constantly, and it is truly wonderful. Excellent design and a spacious lobby equipped with high class food service. The orchestra, chorus, and theatre themselves are very skilled, and the hall is a beautiful space. The hall itself could definitely use more aisles, as I constantly have to deal with people sliding past me to get to the middle, however this is merely a minor annoyance, which is balanced out by the quality of the orchestra and the sound in the hall.",
   "I really enjoyed my visit here. I would suggest ordering tickets online and going straight to will call when you get there but even if you dont the cashiers work efficiently enough to get the lines down quickly. The museum is huge so wear walking shoes. I loved the European art section. I recommend this for a family outing if you can find the time. Second Sundays are free I believe.",
   "I've come here on quite a few occasions but mostly for the symphony orchestra. They play amazingly it's just the people with me often fall asleep until the fast dramatic music plays. I guess the tones were too soothing because they dont even fall asleep with sleeping pills.\ud83d\ude02"

My suggestion is to stay aware of your surroundings when you come to this location just to stay safe. But other than that, one of the best places to take picture and specially at night. AMAZING!",
   "Better visit this bridge on a Sunday to avoid hordes. Best to visit at 3 PM when there is ample sunlight on the downtown buildings. Park your car for free at Martin Luther Jr memorial for free 3 blocks away. Take best shots of the buildings and recreate that walking dead scene sans the zombie hordes and rusting cars. Watch out for human zombies glued to their smartphones though.",

   "Not quite sure this is as \u201cawesome\u201d a place to take night photos as some have proclaimed due to lens flares and localized street lighting, but it certainly is an iconic view of the city\u2019s landscape. A great place for the unique family/friend/loved one photo opp as well as those wanting to make a selfie statement. Limited street parking near Jackson bridge but found Cain st. in Freedom park, across street from bridge, is ideal parking with minimal walk. Would recommend this to anyone visiting to ATL to appreciate the architecture of downtown Atlanta."

   "Once again, It's Time to Escape impressed us with their game master.  This time it was Skylar who really got into the role and was exceedingly helpful.  Having done all the rooms at both this venue and downtown Atlanta, we were excited to find out a new room had been opened since our April 2019 visit.  \n\nThis was a different kind of room - we had to escape but as soon as we finished the last part which was to blow the vault, we only had 2.5 minutes to finish the room even though we still had seven minutes on the clock.  The last minutes are used to collect as much lot as possible and the more, the higher the final score.  \n\nThe plot is that you're a Pinkerton Detective with a mission to bring down the Wild Bunch gang by infiltrating them and stealing their gold, silver, jewels and cash.  There were some very interesting puzzles and for the second day in a row, the need to figure out a dance (yesterday was Le Feu with dance moves on stage needing to be figured out).  Team 93 (that's us) totally sucks at dance moves but luckily, our great Game Master Skylar helped us through it.  \n\nThe room's tech was somewhat strange.  Don't know how much was \"real\" and how much was GM controlled.  There were enough things going on to indicate a high level of GM hand-holding required. \n\nThis was not my favorite It's Time to Escape room but it's pretty good with some very novel puzzles and an interesting finish.  \"Blowing\" the vault door was fun!",
   "My friends and I LOVE escape rooms and we go to them pretty often. Yesterday, we went to Time to Escape for the first time and I don\u2019t have a single complaint about the experience.  From the production value to the level of enthusiasm and fun put into the adventure by our gamemaster Ben, to the way the game played out, everything was top quality. We did the Alcatraz themed room and the clues and puzzles were varied and linear and I felt there was something for everyone on our team to feel like they had participated and had a chance to triumph and get us to our next step. We are already planning to come back very soon and try another room. Cannot recommend this place enough!",
   "We went for my daughter's birthday. Her and her friends had a blast and Ben was such a great host. All around great experience. Very reasonable pricing (call ahead and secure the party room). And even though we didn't escape (King Tut's tomb), the kids had a lot of fun.",
   "Overall; I had fun. We did the Al Capone story and I enjoyed that we were assigned different characters to play with abilities and a side quest. With that said I thought the characters were a distraction from completing the main goal. It's a tough mix. Maybe I didn't play my role correctly, who knows. The bartender, James, was awesome and really did his best to give us a good experience. Nobody beats Donnie on a bet.",
   "The Al Capone room was such a fun experience! We got assigned cards with different characters and each one had a special ability and side quest, which took the room to a whole different level since everybody got super into character. There was also an actor in the room (Alex - he was awesome!) who interacted with us as well and helped build the experience and helped us with clues. He never broke character and made the experience way more exciting and fun. I highly recommend this place and special thanks to Alex for helping us have a great evening!"

Definitely worth a stop. They had a really great collection of woman in science that the students found to be a fresh breath of air as well!",

If you know nothing about African and African American history and culture, you will learn plenty. The two films shown provide an interesting reflection on Auburn Avenue. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The gift counter has some fantastic post cards. The owner has a grand vision for the future of APEX, once realised the space will be phenomenal."

   "My two son's and I are really excited about our next family vacation. \nWe are now planning to visit the most amazing amusement park on the planet, for spring break. \nSix Flags over Georgia has the best rides and the best food.",
   "Six Flags is by far my favorite amusement park in the state of Georgia, but when you travel as much as I do you begin to see it's not perfect. Going to Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure in Florida, or Disneyland in California is an entirely different experience due to the themes of each ride, and the variety of rides available. At Six Flags over Georgia it's all about the roller coasters, which is great for me: a thrill-seeker, but a somewhat miserable experience for many of my friends who have motion sickness, sensitive stomachs, and the like. Don't get me wrong, there's something for everyone at Six Flags, but I will say the park itself caters to a specific niche more than any other I've personally visited. \n\nAs far as I'm aware there are only two dark rides, two water rides, one drop-style ride, and one pendulum: the new Pandemonium. Other than the various similar swing rides scattered throughout the park and the family rides like the carousel and bumper cars, the remaining roster is all roller coasters. If not for Hurricane Harbor which is only open during the warmer months of course, and seasonal events like Fright Fest and Holiday in the Park which we make it a point to attend every year (which are consistently good for the record), Six Flags in general could get pretty old pretty fast for someone who isn't a fan of thrill rides.\n\nLuckily, this sentiment doesn't apply to me. Having grown up in Georgia Six Flags was always my go-to destination for birthday parties once I was tall enough to ride anything I wanted, but being older now, I am constantly around a significant other and friends who are not used to such experiences, and I wish Six Flags had more to offer that we could all enjoy together. I don't mean overpriced carnival games either, although all of us can at least enjoy the overpriced food together! Overall Six Flags is a must for anyone with kids, or anyone who enjoys thrill rides (and not much else). A season's pass and dining pass are well worth the cost if you plan on coming at least twice a year. Even if none of this applies to you, stop by for Holiday in the Park and Fright Fest for the change in scenery: that alone is worth the cost of admission!",
   "Sad disheveled little park. Memories are the best thing I can say about this amusement park. It needs a serious renovation and the cost for everything from a tiny $10 funnel cake to $25 parking is too expensive for the average family. The lines are crazy long, half the rides weren't working, the shows are so sad. The rides were very dated and didn't have the in-line experiences they used to have, boring long lines to ride for 30 seconds. I couldn't even find cotton candy. Seriously? I went for roller coasters and cotton candy and only managed to get in one ride for the afternoon. The few hours there cost approximately $110 to simply walk around trying to find a roller coaster with under an hour wait time and pay a lot of money to do nothing. If they wanted to get more money for food and merchandise, they should make it more affordable and people would buy more. I have been going here for over 40 years and always loved Six Flags, especially the coasters. The memories will always be great though.",
   "We signed up for the diamond membership and highest dining pass. Paid for itself in first day. 6.35 for meal plan per month and today we would have spent 34.00 for food and 30.00 for unlimited drinks so it paid for a whole year in one day. The staff were all pretty friendly, the park was clean except the restrooms could use more attention. Overall, I'm excited for the year ahead and can't wait to use the diamond membership to reserve seats at the water park in the summer... Also, free preferred parking with the diamond membership so it saves 25.00 per visit...",
   "One of the most excitement amusement park I ever went to. With lots of thrilled rides to beautifully scenarios around, this is the best six flags of USA. I liked their application which never let me lost and tells me up-to-date information about the park. The Superman was on of my favorite. Highly recommend everyone to go there. 5 stars. Cheers."

   "I have visited the Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church on several occasions over the years.  I highly recommend everyone take the opportunity to visit this site should you be in the Atlanta area.  There is no cost of entry or to park; I have always been able to find a parking spot close by.\nOn one occasion we were able to sit in on a live presentation by one of the Park Rangers who attended Ebenezer Baptist at the same time as Dr King.  This was, by far, our most memorable visit.  On our most recent visit, however, the ranger informed us that such presentations no longer take place.  \nIt is incredibly inspirational to be in the very church where Dr Martin Luther King, Jr grew up and preached.  Dr King\u2019s message of unity and peace is clearly demonstrated in the church and park on the same grounds.\nThe only criticism I have is I have encountered several other visitors who have been much less than friendly.  It seems Dr King\u2019s message of love and acceptance are not necessarily ascribed to by everyone who visits.  \nAll said, this site is a MUST VISIT!",
   "There was a sermon being played  and if you closed your eyes you could visualize Dr. Martin Luther King  at the pulpit. It was a great sermon and it was uplifting and the song that followed was Use Me Lord so your spiritual being was totally filled .  It was also great to see so many family reunions visiting the site. You saw red, green ,white, black,  and blue shirts with at least 25 people in each group.   It was awesome.",
   "Historical Treasure that I am thankful to have visited in my lifetime! A lot of Great Leaders entered through those doors and made some amazing changes that we will always be thankful for! This experience was remarkable and was a pleasure to visit. Friendly & Informative Tour Guides on site! Free and I believe it is an experience for all ages to enjoy!",
   "Another must visit important landmark in civil rights history - a close walk from the Martin Luther King Jr National Historical Park.",

Goats, sheep and chickens present.  Only about 2-3 minutes stroll from the main building. Staffed by very friendly volunteers who can tell you more about what you're seeing.",
   "I wish I lived in Atlanta so I could volunteer here. Fantastic farm house with docents were very helpful in explaining the different parts of the house and how it was used by the family. Also covering how it had changed over the years. The kitchen building frequently has demonstrations. Even when there is no one there the collection of hearth cooking implements is quite extensive. The slave quarters were fine with explanatory panels. The goats, chickens, turkeys were great to see as was the barn and blacksmith shop and wood working equipment area. You really felt like you went back in time.",
   "Cool little farm and historic center in Atlanta.  Worth stopping by to see the \"old\" houses and buildings.  Plus the farm animals and exhibits.  Gives you a small idea of what life in rural Georgia used to be like.  Plus what life in general used to be like on a farm in the US.  Surprising to find something like this in a well populated residential area.  Easy to find and get to with plenty of parking.",
   "Pre civil war era family farm. Nice job assembling and restoring the buildings. There were guides to answer questions when we visited.",
   "Get in touch with the past for perspective. Learn about Atlanta's history, the importance of the Battle of Atlanta, and this very painting -- and our collective memory of what really happened in 1864 and 1865 to shape this great Nation."

   "Yes, you are at the right spot. No, this is not somebody's random family reunion \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nWe had a wonderful time here when the West End put on one of their candle light concerts with Eric Roberson performing. Walking into the Wren's Nest back yard really does look like your going to the cook-out at the family reunion, but that's all part of the charm. There is such a homey vibe here. I felt like I found a piece of true (old) Atlanta. I will definitely be back.",
   "We went here for the Poe Experience but instructions were unclear and we missed part of the skits because of it. Although the actors were decent the writing could have used some work and the ad-lib didn't live up to expectations. It is fun for the atmosphere but the cost was too much for what we got.",

   "Attended the 105th annual holiday party. It was a great mix of history, music, storytelling etc. You will learn so much about the history of Joel Chandler Harris, author of the Uncle Remus tales. Much misaligned during recent years, his tales were actually quite instrumental in forging new ground in familiarizing cultures with each other in the post Civil War era. Google maps WILL NOT take you into the parking lot. Coming down Lowery into West End the driveway is immediately after the house. Basically when you see St Anthony of Padua's church on the left the house is half a block down on the left. It has a small parking area that is mostly dirt/grass. Keep this in mind in inclement weather!",
   "Perfect for the theme I will be decorating for! Love the old time feel! I have definitely found a gem"

Happy Easter and thank you for making such a solemn day so special and memorable.",

   "The idea behind the museum is pretty fascinating, but they have a relatively small collection with basic information geared towards the more casual learner. Some might also express ethical concerns over visiting, because the bodies and parts displayed are real. But, it can be a great way to introduce high school kids to human anatomy.",
   "The guide was very informative and friendly.  I came a year ago from VA to visiting my daughter in GA. He was very kind to my one of my daughters going to school for nursing. When I returned this year, his pleasant demeanor had not changed when he discussed the exhibit with my youngest daughter in school to be a pediatrician . I really enjoyed seeing and getting knowledge on God's awesome creation... our bodies!",
   "Fantastic! We bring our massage therapy students here every year, and this was the best year yet. They have new interactive stations that really help to engage the students. The guides we had were awesome; highly knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend!",
   "If you're into science and Anatomy you'll love the exhibit. The body's are real so you cant photograph or touch them, but they do have new interactive pieces that you can touch. It's really cool experience."

Definitely coming back abed would highly recommend.",
   "Loved visiting this dog park! We currently live in Columbus and the dog parks here are severely lacking. It was well-worth the drive to give my babies some well-deserved play time and socialization! Nobody seemed too uppity there either, which was a relief as I have a very vocal large dog who is often mistaken for being aggressive. It seemed like most of the people in the park were accustomed to dog interactions and body language so they understood that she wasn't being mean. There was a reasonable amount of shade and nice rocks to sit on. Decent size as well. Overall very pleasant experience.",
   "Large dog park in beautiful piedmont park. Owners are friendly and responsible but the real attraction of course are the doggos, the park is well maintained and kept clean, nice place to let the dogs out.",

I wish there were small games around Kenny's Alley to play for in between bands. A pass to go from Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory would also be a fantastic move from the Masquerade. I don't know if it's legally possible though.",

I will go back for concerts at the venue but if you are looking for anything else to do here forget about it.",

I was unable to get the full effect of the museum because people were holding up areas  Of the museum for several minutes just to take pictures. It would be nice if they had security to keep traffic flowing throughout the sections in order for everyone to enjoy the museum. It's a nice vibe! And the staff were very entertaining. I will most definitely visit again, but probably during the week day so it will be less crowded",

They are very realistic and they give you an in-depth experience of life growing up in the trap, and of living a life of fame and stardom. Anyone eager to learn a little more about the dark underbelly of trap house and hip hop culture in the south will be exceptionally satisfied.",
   "This museum was a great experience as a tourist. Lots photo ops, has a bar, music, dancing interesting TRAP decor. I would say it\u2019s more of a fun activity rather than a historical educative museum. Most of the attendees are also dressed up festively so also fun to people watch and make friends.",

The way the living room was set up with granny sitting on the couch and \"Martin \" playing on the TV was a great concept. I think they did a great job with the gallery for the targeted audience! The staff was great and the atmosphere was a good vibe. Also kudos for Not hiking up the entry price just because this is a tourist spot! They had their \"targeted audience\" in mind it seems. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because of the parking setup and the long lines outdoors.",
   "Anyone who know the culture will have an appreciation for this museum.  It\u2019s a must see when visiting Atlanta GA.  They have captivated the journey some of your favorite rappers have gone through to get to where they are today and there is a lot of history in the artwork. It\u2019s an experience like no other. The staff is very knowledgeable and fun. S/O to Brandon for the tour."

This is definitely an ultra-unique experience, a short hike through displays of bricks, toys, and tiles found at the park. The trail winds through the forest and explores collections of found objects, washed from the banks of the nearby South River, now artfully and whimsically arranged in displays of folk art and culture.\n\nNow an urban nature preserve, this park was once the site of a 19th-century brick company that excavated Georgia\u2019s famous red clay. The excavation pits, now filled with water, comprise the Constitution Lakes. This trail explores nature habitats on the two lakes via long boardwalks, and a variety of creative, weird, and sometimes creepy works of art. We had such a fun time checking this place out!",
   "A great park for an interesting hike in Atlanta. The landscape itself is interesting, but the highlight is Doll's Head trail which doesn't disappoint in create a quirky and eerie experience.",
   "Nice inner city park and the entrance to the Dolls head trail.  Park has a great 6\u2019 wide concrete path.  Lake is a little low and stagnant, but still nice. If you want to go to the dolls head trail follow the path all the way to the end. The Dolls head trail is an art project where they have picked up trash in the park and made art out of it. The trail is a relaxing walk of about 2 miles round trip from the parking lot.",
   "A nice little hidden gem for a short hike. Doll's Head Trail is only a portion of the park. Be sure to see the whole area. There are boardwalks,  wetland areas, and serene views.",

   "It was great to see Dr. King\u2019s legacy continue. I respect his unorthodox and radical way to reach people. I think that the similar narrative to Dr. King\u2019s movement and that of Jesus is that when individuals want to spread unconditional love it never ends well for that person. Obviously, there are a few differences between these two, Jesus being God in the flesh which is being completely God. However, Dr. King was definitely a saint and was doing God\u2019s work.",

Kudos to the Park service, they are very helpful, professional and do a great job.",
   "This is truly one of those places that will leave you speechless. The King Center is a very moving and eye opening experience. You cannot put into words what MLK accomplished during the 60's. He was truly ahead of his time.  You will need at least 2-3 hours to fully take in the entire complex. A must do when you are in downtown Atlanta.",

   "This place takes the title for my favorite park in Georgia. Amazing place for kids, could've spent the entire day here!",
   "We were there for Australia Pink Floyd.  It was great.  The crowd was great.  They allow the people to bring their own refreshments.  The sound system was very good.  Wonderful experience.",
   "What a wonderful path. About three miles, well paved and clean. Our daughter is not old enough to use the playground yet but they are pretty extensive, look fun and well kept."

   "Pretty cool place tucked in the city.  Our beautiful neighbor passed away and his family had a gathering there to honor him. \n\nAfter I left, I went through that moment of what you just experienced - no matter what it is - a movie, concert, event - when it sinks in and you experience the afterglow - for lack of better terminology.\n\nI felt guilty because we were there to miss somebody and grieve and shed tears... And there was very little of that.  It was happy and light-hearted and a beautiful tribute for a beautiful person.  And I think it was because we were surrounded by the peace of nature - tucked in the hustle and bustle of Atlanta.  \n\nIf you feel the call of the mountains, or stressed out, or don't know what to do with yourself... And there is no time for a drive away, take a drive here.  Find a rock or a log, zone out, and clear the mind.  \n\nThen drive your 15 minutes back home...  Thank you Blue Heron supporters for what you've done to carve out nature in our city.",
   "Nice little trail that now connects to the larger trails in the area. Be sure to check out the box turtle enclosure near the school.  Very nice volunteers,  too",
   "Small nature park in the busy part of the city. You feel you\u2019re in wild for few mins. It has a 20 min trail. Note that the trail is narrow for most part. Good for a quick walk. It has a community garden worth spending some time here.",
   "I came to get information about volunteering with blue heron but got distracted by the park's beauty.  I had to walk a part of the trail while i was here. So beautiful.  Can't wait til it's hotter outside.. want to come back and explore and take it all in",
   "Nice small park with a hidden waterfall that's little known by the locals."

   "Canoe is now the best restaurant that we have visited so far. From the moment we made our reservations to the moment we left, everyone exemplified excellent customer service and you could see they cared about their customers. The menu were special to our anniversary, the food was delicious and Sierra did an amazing job as our server. The supervisor came over when we didn't like the first appetizer, which was no fault of anyone working there as we didn't know what we were ordering, and brought our second one out in less than 2 minutes. They made us feel very welcomed and we will definitely be back again. Even the secondary waiter who picked up our silverware was amazing as well. If you're ever in town looking for a great place to attend, stop by the Canoe!",
   "We had a wonderful birthday dinner celebration for my brothers! Brian was the best great recommendation for cocktails. appetizers, entree and dessert! Super helpful and everything was great! We had crab cake, smoked salmon, octopus and calamari all were fantastic! The entrees we had were NY Strip, Pasta, Rabbit- oh my so so good and the sides were perfect and the special was Snapper so delicious! Did I mention the breads too good, my favorite was flatbread with the perfect hint of heat and for dessert the popcorn ice cream sundae- caramel popcorn, ice cream and caramel who knew? Brian really made us feel special, but everyone very welcoming from valet to hostess and all who helped to make our night such a treat!! We\u2019ll be back",
   "Kudos to our server Justin!!! He served with excellence!! The Canoe Atlanta! Delicious Food, Excellent Service, Great Ambiance!! \nThis was my first visit to Canoe!! I\u2019ve listened to my daughter and son in law rave about this restaurant for over a year now. I knew I would be visiting from out of town for her birthday and knew this would have been the perfect place to celebrate her birthday!! \nThe Canoe did not disappoint! I will definitely be visiting again",
   "The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect, dimmed lighting and the outdoor bar near the river was on point, the kangaroo and blueberry granola concoction was to die for! Service was impeccable - our server was very hospitable and paid very close attention to all details. This was truly an experience and I would consider my top 5 restaurants in Atlanta :)",
   "Canoe combines modern atmosphere with a natural feel. The location on the river is perfect and my friends and I had so much fun taking pictures in the gardens. The food and service were both fantastic. We arrived thirty minutes before our reservation but had to wait on one more person. They allowed us to get a table ahead of schedule and the server was more than patient. It was the perfect place for a brunch with friends."

   "What an Amazing Place! Everything we had from the menu was A++++. I would honestly give this place more than 5 stars if I could. Robert our waiter was the best. Thank You Aria for making our 1 year Anniversary unforgettable \ud83d\udc4c",
   "Aria is one of these locations about which one can't speak without excitement and somewhat trepidation. First of all this awesome Aria has anything to do with that sushi chain like known in Chicago and few other places. This place is absolutely authentic,  food is inventive,  very memorable,  wine selection is superb. The champagne selection is a symphony. \nEvery time we spend a night here it's a time of pure pleasure. In my opinion this restaurant would greatly benefit from life violin or Spanish guitar player. The place is justifiably expensive.",
   "We had the set menu and it was one of the finest we have had. The wine pairing was perfect, quantity just sufficient enough that you can actually enjoy all the courses. All the dishes very unique and presented in a very appealing way. For such a fancy high end restaurant, the service was remarkable amazing and staff extremely friendly, a rare thing these days. Overall I highly recommend this place, especially their lobster tail.",
   "This is definitely the best restaurant in Atlanta to celebrate any occasion. The food and the service are perfect. Every time I went there, the servers were so attentive to my needs. They have the best scallops with decent prices for their food. Highly recommended!",
   "Although a staple in Buckhead, the food is good but not great for the price.  As stated in other reviews, there are so many more choices that offer more bang for the buck.  The ambiance is nice and the parking can be minimal at peak times."

It looks like it has been there for a long time so don't expect fancy seating. The parking is a little tricky but you will figure it out. They offer all breakfast options. The single pancake is huge and good. I loved the crispy edges. I will definitely return.",
   "Wonderful little brunch cafe that I frequent with my friends on the weekends. The menu has nice balance of traditional southeastern breakfast food while also offering a creative new look at some of the classics. Over the few times I've been there, the food is consistent and quick. The service staff is always very friendly and helpful. They make everyone feel like a regular. If you're lucky, you'll be able to catch Shady one morning playing some great jazz piano.",
   "Extremely delicious, I'll definitely be back...\nI tried the fried chicken sandwich, it was magnificent, it also came with some type of dipping sauce that reminded me of a cucumber sauce, I'm not sure, but great. Staff was friendly and helpful, although busy they were very attentive and the wait wasn't to long as well. There is something for basically any budget from what I saw at a quick glance. Chill diverse environment, check them out.",
   "Home Grown is Atlanta's best spot for a full, traditional Southern diner breakfast. They have delicious fried foods, blue plates, and baked goods. There is usually a line to get in, especially on weekends. I recommend coming in on a weekday afternoon if you want fast service. Overall, this is an amazing restaurant!",
   "Disappointed. I went for the country fried steak but after a couple of bites I couldn't finish it. It was too chewy. I understand it is not a prime cut but it was way too tough. The mashed potatoes seemed to have been under a heat lamp for a while and not freshly scooped. The overall cleanliness was not impressive. BUT, the staff were amazing and very nice. The place is quaint and like a \"greasy spoon\" should look. Lots of character. I didn't finish my meal. It has a strong following so maybe my personal experience was an exception."

Sides are like any nice steakhouse they are sharable and very good. We have eaten here on several occasions and always had a fantastic meal and excellent service. I would say this is a must do if in the area. If you want to eat at a great steakhouse book this place you will not be disappointed.",
   "Fantastic high end steak and seafood restaurant.  Service is second to none.  The food and menu are absolutely fabulous.  You will not be disappointed.  In fact, you will agree with everyone else at your table that this is one of the best steak restaurants you have ever been to. Priced very high but appropriate for the personalized service and fantastic food items and great city atmosphere that you will receive.  Easy in and out parking with courteous valet service.",
   "For years this has been my favorite steakhouse in Atlanta until today. My husband and I made a reservation, well in advance, to take my parents here as well as our 9 month old. My parents made arrangements to come  visit us and wanted to see their grandchild. It was noted on our reservation that it was for 4 adults plus a baby. I received a confirmation when I made the reservation as well as a second confirmation yesterday. 4 hours prior to our reservation, I receive a call stating they have a policy  no one under the age of 6 years may dine. It didn't even cross my mind a child wouldn't be allowed. We've never had an issue at ANY fine dining restaurant in Atlanta as well as can't tell you the number of times I've been to Bones. I can't get a babysitter with a few hours notice and would have made other arrangements had I been notified earlier. I asked why I wasn't called prior and they only offered an apology, stated they can't review reservations in advance and then cancelled my reservation. I can assure you they can and have in the past made arrangements ahead of time. I have had a couple private dining events here as well, both personal and business. A mere apology and canceling a reservation hours before is not acceptable.",
   "This place was great. Truly. We popped in for lunch without a reservation (which are highly recommended), but the staff was very nonjudgmental and treated us very well. We were tired from an exhausting morning and casually mentioned that it was our anniversary. Wow. They really went out of their way to make our experience special, regardless of the lack of warning. The food was super simple. The jumbo lump salad was just jumbo lump in a cabbage leaf with some horseradish sauce on the side, for example. But it was HUGE and FRESH jumbo lump - and absolutely delicious. The steak was charred on the outside and tender and red on the inside and served with oven roasted asparagus and was super simple but done PERFECTLY. Highly recommend. Thank you guys for an awesome experience!!!",
   "Amazing views and amazing food. We used a coupon found on Travel Zoo and had no issues. I mentioned on the reservation that it was my friend's birthday and they took amazing care of us. Everyone came over to say happy birthday and our waiter sang (and I mean really SANG) happy birthday to my friend. The ambiance was nice. Cute place for a date, girls night out or happy hour."

   "One of the top 5 meals we ever had across the US and Europe. Appreciated the artistry for it was without doubt art that you ate. The food is the show and perfectly done. What a culinary journey. We love to cook, but there was not one thing that I could even contemplate duplicating. It was one small dish after another leaving us pleasantly satisfied. The marrying of favors and even textures was off the charts. The staff was wonderful, friendly, and helpful. Make note that the hostess station is down a driveway, through the rear of the building, and then down a set of steps. We were so blown away that we are already planning on when to return. If you think volume equates to value then find a buffet to eat at rather than here.",
   "Worth the experience!  The attention to detail, from plating to presentation shows Staplehouse is more than a \"restaurant.\"  We've had many memorable meals here and always leave feeling satisfied knowing it was also going to a good cause.  Try getting there a bit early and visiting the speakeasy upstairs.",
   "I had never experienced a true tasting course menu before. I can totally appreciate now why Staplehouse has a wait list as long as it is! The presentation and of each dish paired with a wine by an experienced sommelier truly made the dining experience one that will remain with me for a long while. Everything was a blend of art, flavor, and talent on the part of the entire staff at Staplehouse.",
   "What an amazing experience! While the food was as opulent as is gets, the atmosphere was so comfortable and laid back. The service was a perfect blend of all the things you would come to expect from a restaurant at this price point.  Kara visited the table which was delightful.  She is truly a joy to chat with and you can tell she is very passionate about everything that is Staplehouse.  I highly recommend the tasting menu accompanied with the beverage pairing.  Let them guide the night and you will have your mind blown.",
   "Best meal we've had. Ever. Delicious, playful, creative. Service was excellent. Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Incredible experience and supports a wonderful cause (The Giving Kitchen). Many thanks to Allison and the rest of the Staplehouse staff for a beautiful (and extremely memorable) anniversary dinner. \n\nP. S. Don't worry about trying to memorize your menu for the evening - they give you a list of all the awesome things you just ate at the very end of the meal."

Definitely one of the best in Atlanta. Highly recommended!",

Nan Fine Dining is the total experience.",

But this is fine dining so be prepared to pay for REALLY good food The bill will reflect it.. The service was great , the drinks and ambience just as good. It was quiet where you could have conversation without raising your voice, just a overall great experience.",

   "Look we have been customers for over 10 years now and have always had great experiences with both the food and the service. I called to make a Mother\u2019s Day order for pickup, my Mother\u2019s Day gift because that\u2019s how much I\u2019ve loved this place. Everything was fine until I asked for a total and then sarcastically I was told a total would not be available until Sunday because that\u2019s when it would be \u201crung up.\u201d But still I politely said that\u2019s okay and gave my debit card info anyways. Right after the lady asked if a gratuity for servers and staff would be okay and I said of course. She then asked if 20% was okay and I said that\u2019s fine. She had already asked to put me on hold before taking my card info so I just felt kind of rushed. After a couple of minutes of thinking about it I thought how can I commit to a 20% tip when I wasn\u2019t even given a total? I\u2019m a mother of 2 young kids and this kind of dinner is a splurge plus the drive to the city because we are not local to the area. I called back and the same employee answered, I\u2019m not going to name her directly, and I explained that of course we would leave a tip but could we decide that at the time of pickup? She said yes and she understood and then I got hung up on...no thank you or see you on Sunday, goodbye, just click. Keep in mind this was well over a $100 order. Just so unprofessional and flat out rude! And so unnecessary right now given the circumstances! Yes, everyone is under more stress and anxiety right now but that is no way to run a business! And I know all of those employees need support and extra help right now in restaurants and businesses everywhere. We could have chosen to support our local mom and pop restaurant businesses in our town but this is what I wanted for my Mother\u2019s Day. Lesson learned, if you are not a weekly regular of this restaurant, then do not expect anything extraordinary. And for the price you should be treated like queens and kings every single time. So, so disappointed but will be canceling the order first thing in the morning and not sure when we\u2019ll be back for dine in. Now more than ever is the time to be spreading positivity and kindness, not being unnecessarily disrespectful and rude.",
   "This is a hidden gem in Atlanta. Located in the basement of an extremely unassuming condominium tower, La Grotta is a very authentic and tasty Italian restaurant. Everything in the menu seems to be well prepared and extremely tasty and the service is excellent as well. It's a bit on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for every time. I recommend going here for something romantic or just a fancy outing. You will enjoy it and want to come back soon.",

You get two nice size pieces of chicken and two flaky biscuits. The waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Conveniently located right next to the Georgia Aquarium and just minutes from the Mercedes Benz Dome and State Farm Arena. I must do if you are close to downtown.",
   "I was hungry for chicken and waffles. Google told me this is one of the best spots. Showed up at 915 am on Sunday and we were told the wait was 30 minutes. Promptly by 945 am we were seated (our party had 2 people only).\n\nFrom that point on, service was lightning fast and very helpful. We ordered the peach cobbler French toast and the chicken and waffles. Everything was scrumptious! In particular, the breading on the chicken was surprisingly light, so you didn't feel as full as you do when eating other dishes of this type. \n\nAll in, our bill was under $40. Great food and well worth the wait!",
   "My daughter and I took my grandson out to breakfast on February 26, 2020, and had a horrible experience from the moment we arrived. As we were approaching there was another family reading a sign on the door, which said use other door. They started to walk to the right looking for another door. As we walked up an employee, a middle aged woman wearing royal blue pants and a ponytail came to the door and pushed it open and said \"were open\".  Even though her demeanor was less than professional we continued inside. Once inside the hostess the same woman who came to the door,  still not smiling or even having a pleasant look on her face says \"I'll be right with you\". In that moment I thought to myself, well there fast if nothing else. She came back and said follow me, as we began to follow her, she looked back and said no not you, they were here first. Referencing the family that tried to go in another way. Even though we walked in first I didn't have a problem with it because they were. She just could have done it better by not looking directly at me, when she said to follow her. Strike two at this point but still thinking that it has to get better. When she returned, she said follow me and we did. She then walked us to the other side of the restaurant and said wait 1 minute, I asked where are you seating us? She pointed to a table in the middle, I then said great because I don't want to be along the wall. She said no I'm going to put you there, pointing to the same table in the middle. She then went and put another couple at the same table she had just said 45 seconds prior is where we would be seated. Strike three for sure, or is it. She then returned and tried to seat us along the wall, which is where I told her I didn't want to sit. She says is there a problem and I could barely speak  for shock. I then told her,  you said you were putting us at that table and then you placed someone who came after us there after telling me it was our table. Knowing that she had messed up, she turned to me and said I'll follow you,  where would you like to sit?  I looked around and the only seats were where I asked not to be seated. We left with a hungry 3 year old in tow.  I will never return, I was made to feel less than and that will never be acceptable. It's important to hire respectable,  caring employees.  Treat all customers equally, it shouldn't matter if your visiting Atlanta or live a block away.",
   "Atlanta Breakfast Club was an amazing delight! The food and hospitality from the crew here was GREAT! Had the Loaded Chicken Biscuit and Gravy and let me tell you about the perfection they have came up with. Extremely savory and just the right amount of food! I suggest any travel or local to check out the ABC!!! I'll be back some time to try the Breakfast Tacos!!!",
   "We were in town for the weekend and have been wanting to try this place and there is always a line it seems. We waited about 50 minutes to be seated. They had heaters outside to sit by for chilly mornings. Once we were seated the service was very very fast! The food was great and so was the coffee. FYI you can reserve a table on YELP for this restaurant. Wish I would have known that sooner."

   "Loved this place. Being from the area, we had heard about it for a long time, but never been. We finally went there for an anniversary dinner, and it lived up to its reputation. All the food we tried was delicious. The service was beyond what we have experienced at most other nice restaurants. I have been here 4 times and have never been dissatisfied. The dishes are all perfectly prepared and delicious. The prix fixe menu takes all the stress out of the meal. As long as you are prepared to spend $200 per person (I\u2019m adding $ for wine and tip) you will not be disappointed!",
   "We have never had a bad meal at Bacchanalia. Everything here is wonderful. The staff is attentive and helpful. The food is exquisite. We come here to celebrate our birthdays every year and they always make it a special occasion. Cannot wait to go back again for our next meal here. Wow such a great experience and meal. Thank you so much!!!",
   "So to let you know I have never had a better dining experience when it comes to customer service. The wait staff was prompt and engaging, quick with information about dishes and drinks. At one point totaling providing a cocktail on the fly for me to enjoy. Warmest thanks also to the spirits guru on site loved hearing about your passion and hope that it continues to flourish. As for why not the fifth star... for me it was the disconnect from some of the dishes. For a long time I love being told a culinary story visually, textually, and via flavors. This was lacking in our meal. There were hits though (mushroom broth, and crab fritter) but with some parts lacking seasoning and others having flavor disconnects. However this will not keep me from giving Bacchanalia another go. Upon that second visit I hope to change this to five!",
   "Simply amazing!  The food was appealing both to the palate and the eyes.  Everything was prepared with great skill and care.  The wait staff is pleasant and always there when needed, but very inconspicuous so you can enjoy the moment with your company.  Great special occasion place. Worth the cost for such an incredible experience.",
   "The best food in Atlanta. I was blown away by the quality of the food and mixture of flavors. They truly have a gifted chef. The setting was elegant the service was excellent. It is very pricey so it is best reserved for special occasions.  They even gave us a free to go desert on our way out the door."

   "We have been going here for several years, and it feels like the service has been getting slower each time. The meat options are still good, but it takes awhile for them to be brought around. The cauliflower steak is a great option for vegetarians or people who aren\u2019t feeling steak. There is also the salad bar that has lots of options, like chicken salad and various cheeses. The sides they bring to the table, like Brazilian cheese bread and fried bananas, are delicious! The servers are very courteous, but they may just need more people to bring around the meats.",
   "This place is awesome! My husband and I went here on Valentine\u2019s Day and and there a long wait as expected. Our waiter Andrew was amazing! Perfect conversation. He knew exactly what we needed and when we needed it. He honest and highly educated about all the menus options. I even overheard him offering to write down recipes for the couple that inquired about the recipe of a menu item. He was just awesome!!! Can\u2019t wait to come back!!!",
   "The concept of this restaurant is an open buffet - unlimited meat and salad. Eat until you drop for 40/pax. Selection of meats is alright - cooked to perfection, plus an added Brazilian traditional appetizers, mostly bananas. I love the free dessert for birthday celebrants - so sweet of them to give that to their guests. Service is excellent, as well as the ambience. This location is smaller compared to similar restaurants we\u2019ve tried in the past. Drinks are everywhere - they have bars if you want to try their wines and mixed drinks. Price is okay for one time occasion with family and friends.",
   "The lamb was amazing, best I\u2019ve had since moving to Atlanta. Also the experience was amazing. Sergio was a waiter for the evening and he did a spectacular job. He was able to get quick grip on what my +1 and I wanted. He had great suggestions, even with the mixed drinks! Super patient, super kind, FABULOUS.",
   "It has been a tradition for say like the last four or five years our office does our Christmas lunch here. Probably the most amazing salad bar anywhere. But was extremely happy to see you can now order just one meat to have instead of all different types and for me way too much. Doing the individual offers of meats is perfect, and exactly what I did. Service has been great every time. Highly recommend!"

   "We were directed to Wisteria by our hotel concierge. This is the place that you want to go to run into local movers and shakers. A relatively small and quaint restaurant. A special shout out to the host, Thomas. Very courteous and thoughtful He offered us a cocktail on the house as a courtesy because of our tight seating arrangement. He took charge and made us feel welcome. We had a great experience because of his courtesy and professionalism. A true southern gentleman. Highly recommend to my fellow travelers.",
   "This restaurant was a pleasant surprise I read reviews on wisteria and said that one day I'd come. I'm so glad I finally did. It's a nice eclectic little hole in the wall type of place. You wouldn't expect to see such nice works of art just from walking by outside. Once inside, the staff was very helpful and attentive. They made great good recommendations.  The food was as unique as it was delicious.  Me and my husband will definitely come back. If you find this review helpful, please press like below.",

   "Great atmosphere and good food! Steak was great, a little more done than medium, but okay. The fried pie was just not that great, really expected a larger portion for the price and it was very tart. All in all it was a good place to eat.",
   "Great food! Great service! I had the trout and ordinarily I wouldn\u2019t order trout but it came highly recommended and it was 10/10. Crab bisque was amazing. Arancini was 10/10. Everything was good! Cool atmosphere. Not the place you want to go if you\u2019re looking for a more private, quiet dinner because the tables are pretty close together and you can basically hear everyone\u2019s conversations. Very European style dining. But a GREAT spot for a casual date night."

   "OK that might be over the top, but it was one of the most unique and fun dinner experiences I've had. First the concept, the chefs offer their dishes, with moments for you to decide thumbs up or down...and they offer every single thing on the menu (unless there is allergy). The action moves fast. Good news is whatever you pick, it is fantastic. Octopus was top notch. There was a bean dish that was unbelievable. Unique carrot cake. Food is extremely inventive. Let the excellent staff guide you.",
   "My son brought us to this restaurant when I was visiting him in Atlanta. Very cool concept and hip atmosphere! Tapas sized plates allow you to try a lot of different items - many I may not have ordered off the menu! There were 4 of us in the party and we worked out way through substantially all the menu - sampling some excellent cuisine. Highly recommend giving it a try.",
   "Absolute must do if you visit Atlanta or live here. Our server, Ruth, really complimented to the feel and atmosphere of the restaurant, even though the food alone speaks for itself and isn't in need of any advocacy. It was, as promised, a unique and unforgettable experience. So glad we found this special spot. \n(Also completely changed our die hard discrimination against quail)",
   "Gunshow never ever disappoints! \n\nAll the chefs are amazing. The presentation of the food is fun. Love that you get to see everything before you say yes/no. Though if you have a hard time telling people no, you may be walking out paying more than you meant to! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nYou\u2019ll probably be surprised and say yes to something that sounded weird, or say no to something you thought you\u2019d hate. Try it all! Every single dish on the ever-changing menu will be worth it. \n\nThe drinks are also tasty. Drink list is decent.",
   "It like dimsum style. The chefs come out with their dishes and tell you about it and if you like it you get it. It's meant to be shared but portions are small but it's high quality ingredients so it's an experience. I think the menu changes often. It's a lot of fusion food which makes it fun and playful. Dishes can be anywhere from 14-26 and you can order more than one. It's a bit pricey but I really enjoyed the whole vibe of the people here. Parking is in the back and it's free. Drinks were good and they use metal straws ! \ud83d\udc22 \u2764\ufe0f"

   "One of my favorite spots for fine dining in the city. This was my third visit and it was just as delicious and enjoyable as my previous two visits. Reserved a spot on the outside patio (which is covered and has heaters, so it was not cold at all) and we were the only ones seated there for the duration of the night. Talk about fantastic ambiance. All the food was delicious, our server was very friendly and fun, and even the valet was courteous and amiable. I love Babette's Cafe, the biggest shame is that I don't get a chance to come here more often.",
   "A fantastic restaurant. We enjoyed the drinks and food very much. The grilled octopus and mussels were delicious. The sauce of mussels was the best one we have ever had so far. The desserts (brulee and chocolate bread pudding) were also tasty. It is noteworthy that the entrees were also good, although not as impressive, possibly because the appetizers had raised our expectation too much. Overall, the quality is worth its price. I will definitely come back with family and friends.",
   "The food and service was excellent.  The trout and filet were the choices for our table.  Both are good choices. The chocolate cake was a great dessert choice. Our server, Ginger, was very personable. Very attentive but not intrusive.",
   "An amazing place with requisite dishes all around!\n\nEach dish really feels home made, and the whole place reminds me of my times in France both in ambience and in quality!\n\nA definite must while you're in Atlanta!",
   "I go to this unique place often  as I like the special air that is characterizes this place. The crew is extraordianrillyremarkably helpful and well trained. The service is absolutely quick. Most important, the food they cook is outstanding. I visited often and I was always satisfied. The expense is decent. I suggest this restaurant to to all."

   "INCREDIBLE! First time to this location. When you walk in, you have this very warm and elegant environment. This place has been put on the favorite list officially! Was here to celebrate a birthday and it was outstanding! The food was different, unique to taste, and presented beautifully! The service was exceptional! The dinning experience was very refreshing to this type of food! Was just an outstanding experience. Between the experience, the service, and the food; it was definitely worth every penny. Will be coming back soon!",
   "Would highly recommend. The duck thigh was a must, such good flavor. I never would have tried the escargot fried rice had it not been for the amazing service that suggested it. So delicious. Also - get the grilled cheese (bikini) when you go. The best. I've. Ever. Had.",
   "Really really enjoyed this place. The staff was knowledgeable and on point.   The cocktails were inventive and the wine paired expertly.  And the food. Oh the food. We barely got into the menu and left fully sated. Awesome.",
   "Incredible experience. We came with 12 including one vegetarian and none of us went home dissatisfied. The appetizers were amazing and a couple of guys eat octopus for the first time and were blown away. The vegetarian dishes were incredible and the choices were abound for everyone. One of our friends comes to this restaurant with a vegan friend every time she is in Atlanta so very Vegan friendly as well. And service was casual but very good with great suggestions.",
   "What a fun night. Went there with friends to celebrate a 50th birthday. The experience was so fun. Carter, our server, was very knowledgeable about both the food and the drink menus and worked really hard to make our experience unique and memorable for us. The food was exceptional and unlike anything we've had before. \n\nDefinitely looking forward to when we can return and try the many other interesting menu items."

Indeed, the food we orders was amazing- fresh, beautifully presented and perfectly cooked, coupled with service that  was quick, polite and informative. The recommendation on the desserts was particularly excellent. The cocktail menu was similarly enjoyable and though neither myself nor my partner are big drinkers, we were both able to find something we both liked. We will be returning very soon!",

Attentive, able to answer all of our questions, friendly, and not a helicopter server at all.\nThe food was so fantastic. We got two appetizers, entrees, dessert, and cocktails. All of which were equally amazing and reasonably priced. \nThe details in everything were great. Beautiful place .\nWe will definitely be back. Ten stars.",
   "Very nice ambiance, great service and a very nice Old World wine list. Also, great cocktails, especially the Miller Thyme! The appetizers were great and we enjoyed the fritters and the egg. The entree selection was outstanding- and we thoroughly enjoyed the Brisket and the Ravioli dish. This place is truly a hidden gem!",
   "We arrived with a family gathering of 11 people. Even though we kept switching places at the table in order for different family members to catch up with each other, the waiter was able to recall who ordered which dish. The food was healthy and delicious. We ordered a wide variety of appetizers. My favorite was the kale salad with lemony dressing and the various dishes with exotic radishes. My New York strip steak was cooked to perfection. The four teenagers at the table were able to order fancy non-alcoholic drinks that they liked so much they ordered again and again",
   "As out of towners, tried this place based on reviews. Upscale (reservations recommended). Well conceived and laid out dining room, knowledgeable, patient, well trained wait staff. No background music, a ;plus. Apps: house made humus, average. Hush puppies, done right. Lamb meatballs, tender, well  flavored.. Entrees: Tile fish, broiled in butter, good crust, pistachio/grapefruit accompaniment, nice combo. Brisket a disappointment, not special and strangely salty. All in all, well set up, food beautifully presented, looks better than it eats."

I gave it four stars because it's kind of a tight squeeze  and if you don't have a reservation it could be a wait. But the hosts are always mindful of this and sometimes will work you in quicker than they promised. You also have to valet park as street parking is difficult but I guess all of this adds to the character of the place.",
   "We were impressed by everything at Poor Clavins! The interesting cocktail menu made it difficult to choice but \u201cFrankly My Dear\u201d is the most unique and glamorous of all\u2014rose petals floating on a perfect combination of flavors! We loved our entrees. The sea bass was the best. Colleagues enjoyed tofu and seafood dishes. We had the unusual unfortunate experience of having a \u201ckitchen error\u201d that was a problem with a colleague\u2019s entree. The staff went out of their way to help her and handled it so PROFESSIONALLY! We were impressed!",
   "Went to Poor Calvin's last night with wife and friends. First off our waitress she was very attentive.and very acknowledge about the menu there. Secondly the Food is truly Delicious. I tried 3 appetizers and each one was incredibly. Then my main dish the Ribs were deep fried and out of this world Delicious. We all had a excellent time there. Will highly recommend this Restaurant to everyone. My place you will fall in love with.  See you soon",

We made an reservation so the wait was minimal. Our server was personable. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered suggestions. I have enjoyed the food each time I come here and will be back.",
   "We went for brunch and it was fantastic. I got the shrimp and grits with Cajun sausage. The grits weren\u2019t overpowered by the other flavors and it was cheesy and creamy. My friend got a fried fish curry dish - the curry sauce was the best thing I tasted all week. We got the fried goat cheese appetizer and that also did not disappoint. Would definitely go back."

   "We are from KCMO so BBQ is a huge thing for us, we were in Atlanta for business and was craving some BBQ.  Like most people, we used Google to find the best BBQ in the area and found this cute little place.  Definitely did not disappoint! Everything we had was so delicious, fall off the bone ribs that were moist and full of flavor. The Mac and Cheese was delicious. The brisket was good! We will definitely come back if/when we are in the area again!",
   "Outstanding Texas BBQ. Great service. Got my order in 6 minutes Had the pulled pork plate with Mac and cheese and baked beans. Very authentic! It's crazy popular on week days with contractors, which is a good sign but can be difficult to get a table. This place is the real deal and worth the wait!",
   "Amazing food! Friendly service. So busy! Get there early, parking goes quick. Try their name sake cocktail. Fresh citrus and a honeysuckle vodka. The brisket comes either chopped or sliced. Very tender and you have the option for fatty or lean with the sliced brisket. The pulled pork is tender and juicy. Great flavor without sauce. The tots covered with Brunswick stew are amazing! A meal in itself. The jalapeno and cheese sausage is great with the pimento cheese. Definitely worth a drive to try this place. Was very dark inside, but we ended up sitting outside to get a quick table. Chairs outside were comfortable."

It made us feel welcome and it all made our anniversary a memorable one.\nThe waiter and restaurant picked up our parking and had our car waiting pn us at the door when we left.\nI highly recommend Nikolais Roof for dining or special occasions.  You will not be disappointed so give it a try. You will be back",

And the service was outstanding. Scott was our server and he did an excellent job. Needless to say we were glad we came here for dinner. It was a good choice.",
   "Started with the crab cake, the flavor was delicious, juicy, but a tad more seared than I prefer.  The greens beneath were such a great pairing, and the preparation was unique.  Another starter, the braised boar risotto was also very tasty, and a break from the norm.  My wife had the beef tenderloin, and it was delicious, and cooked to the appropriate temperature, flavor, bite and chew were all what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  I had the herb crusted lamb chops.  In fairness, they were cooked well, the seasoning was great, but were pungent than any other lamb chops I've ever had - sorry for the poor quality on the photo, low light and dimmed screen weren't exposed until I posted this review.  The symphony bar, with the cinnamon ice cream was delicious, divine even.  The creme brulee was not our favorite.  All in all a 5 star experience, and the view wasn't hateful until the fog rolled in.  Staff was super friendly and patient in helping my wife find a wine that she enjoyed.",
   "This was a very pleasant 1st time dining experience. The view from our table was magnificent and the atmosphere was quiet while not stuffy. Our waitress knew every detail of the 3-5 course menu. Cocktails and wine were excellent. Will dine again.",
   "Fine dining with a great view. On a clear day you can see Stone Mountain. The restaurant will validate parking, even if you valet. Don't forget to tip your valet!"

My sister had the crab bisque, which was rich and creamy. Our entrees consisted of fried chicken and pork chop dishes. Both proteins were cooked sublimely. My only critique would be the wine sauce that accompanied the pork. I do not think it was reduced enough. It was somewhat bitter and the taste of alcohol was still heavily present.\n\nNonetheless, my experience was wonderful. I will definitely be back next time! \n\nP.S. The complementary cornbread and biscuits was fantastic.",

Our table of 7 tried a variety of dishes and everyone loved their choices. The cauliflower appetizer was a standout for me. Our server was knowledgeable about all of the food options as well as the wine pairings. Water glasses were refilled without having to be asked. Definitely worth it!",
   "I enjoyed this restaurant. Made a reservation here and the staff was friendly and helpful. The food was well seasoned and their signature fried chicken was tasty. Also tried the pork chop and a couple of appetizers which were all prepared well and delicious. Great spot for a nice dinner in midtown Atlanta. Enjoy!",
   "Food and place is a National treasure. Our server Trinity was fantastic and actually let me try the fried green tomatoes which I had never had before. It was divine. Fried chicken and mashed potatoes plus the pan seared scallops left me speechless. Dinner for 2 check left me wondering if the computers math was accurate. So affordable given their location and quality food. I personally thanked the Chef. Going back soon I\u2019ll have to try the entire menu eventually. Thanks Trinity!!!"

I tried the fish, and the amount they gave me for seven dollars was incredible. The fish was great too.",

Love them can\u2019t wait to come back!!!! Shot out to the manager and the guy from NY!!! From the cashier to the cook... simply AMAZING! Thank you!!",
   "Hands down the best wings I\u2019ve had in Atlanta in a while. Definitely going back to try out the other items on the menu! Also the owner there is very kind and respectful so you\u2019ll always have a good experience there.",
   "This place is a hidden gem!  The owner was very kind and personal. The wings were different from what I was used to and they were fantastic!!! The lemon pepper chicken batter was crispy and seasoned really well. I was very surprised when he offered me crackers from my country. I will definitely be coming back."

Appetizers, Entrees, Sides, Drinks, Adult Beverages and Desserts.  They have the best fried chicken, pot pies and Grilled Pork Chops.  If you are in town and looking for an unique place/experience look no further.  You can not go wrong picking this place.",
   "One of the top Southern restaurants in Atlanta. All food is made from scratch and from the original recipes. Fried chicken was super tender and fried to perfection. There are a variety of sides to choose from which enhance the main dish. If it is your first time ensure you notify your server for some Southern hospitality. The atmosphere is full of history and the original building is still in use. This was a fantastic experience and a must try if you are searching for Southern comfort food.",
   "Very tasty southern food and wonderful atmosphere, was a very comfortable place to hold into during a rain storm. Sat at the bar area and loved talking and getting recommendations from bartender. Started with a yummy Mint Julep.\nFood was amazing! I tried the chicken fried chicken & would highly recommend. Had the sweet potato souflee & green beans as sides. The bread basket was very tasty too.",
   "This was our first visit there and we enjoyed it very much. My husband had the meat loaf but probably would not order it again. It was good but not as good as Cracker Barrels. I had the chicken pot pie and it was great! Our friend had the turkey and dressing and other than  bringing her cocktail sauce instead of cranberry sauce her meal was delicious too. They did correct that mistake! My husband had mac and cheese and I wish I had ordered it too! The rolls and corn bread were wonderful and all in all it was a special place to dine.",
   "Fantastic southern cuisine! Nothing I ordered was bad. The portions are huge so I had to bring a good portion of it home. The atmosphere was \"southern dining room\". Clean. Wait staff was great, and very helpful when ordering. I went there for lunch, but would only go back for dinner (comfort food makes me sleepy)."

   "Went to the St. Regis to view the Garden Room Restaurant. Arrived to receive the great customer service that the hotel is known for. Loved the ambiance of the Garden Room Restaurant. Walked in to what seemed to be a beautiful atrium connected to a grand home, just with a bar. Decor well thought-out with beautiful plants, artificial and live. Love the way the seating was an ordered hodgepodge. My only complaint with the seating, where we were seated, is that the servers were having issues with getting around in the close quarters. The food is very tasty and loved the sharable portions. The service was great.\n\nMy only regret is that I don't remember our server's name. She served us three guys with a feeling that we were having dinner with her and not as customers. I am not a pork or beef eater, so she recommended items that definitely did not have beef or pork bi-products. Enjoyed the adventure into the garden.",
   "Amazing experience for me and my girlfriend. We were celebrating our 2 year anniversary and the staff made it a night to remember. I cannot express enough how wonderful the experience was from ease of booking the reservation, service, attention to detail and atmosphere. Loved every moment. Thank you Atlas! A must go for a unique and special experience.",
   "Service is AMAZING! Joseph is an amazing sever. Had the caviar flight and a fish dish that was AMAZING. Hubbi had aged beef waygu that was out of this world! Marbleized to perfection!",
   "Probably the best restaurant experience I've had in Atlanta. Every single thing we ordered was fantastic from the wine to the sides to the soups to the entrees. The service was incredible and we were made to feel like the only people in the building. One person at the table asked if they could make beef tartare and not only did they agree even with it not on the menu, but it came out as a complete fully imagined dish. It takes a real chef to be able to create a full dish on the spot and really speaks to the quality of dining here",
   "Incredible meal. Truly special food and excellent service. Plan to spend some time between courses. This isn't the place to rush through a meal. That's not how they do it. Linger and enjoy."

   "Traditional farm-to-table restaurant.  Food was very fresh.  Rolls were to die for. I ordered the pork and my husband ordered the lamb shank. Mine was good but not as tender as I expected and my husband said his was excellent. Sides were really good, fingerling potatoes and carrots. The ambience was okay as the seating reminded me of being in Europe with how close some of the tables are, including ours. Our server was outstanding and everyone else we encountered.",
   "American food with all kinds of twists. Whatever the sauce is with the asparagus is over the top good. I must say, the fried chicken was moist, however, just not enough spice. Almost there, but a tad bit bland. Friend loved the rabbit. Fries were great. Cool bar upstairs. Nice place.",
   "Had lunch at JCT kitchen today and just had to post a review because the shrimp and grits were AMAZING. The best I\u2019ve had in a looooong time. The croutons.... yum. Still thinking about it many hours later. My mother ordered the vegetable plate, which was also incredibly delicious. Veggie plates can be hit or miss and this one was definitely a hit. We had the chocolate hazelnut tart for desert which was also delicious. Service was good, just a bit slow for lunch. Totally worth the wait, looking forward to going back.",
   "Awesome food and attentive service. Went for a party.  20 people.  From salad to dessert the service and attention was expert in class. Food type was common place but prepared in unique and unusually flavorful. 5 star meal served in courses. \nEXTRA points for this size group.  EXCELLENT follow up and communication. Additional servers stepped in smoothly when needed. Friendly staff and a good variety of music playing overhead.",

   "Went here last week for our anniversary. All the apps, pasta dishes, and desserts we tried were delicious. The wait staff were all friendly and attentive. The wine pairings recommended by our server were good. Next time may try the 4-course tasting menu!\n\nWe had a reservation and were sat promptly. While we diner several other tables remained open the whole time while the bar and patio were busy with people waiting. Not sure if the kitchen was backed up or what. The waitstaff seemed to be tripping over each other with not enough to do while guests were being quoted long waits (over an hour) while tables sat empty. \n\nI do wish there were a few more non-pasta options. We don\u2019t eat a lot of pasta so it will likely be a long time before we return.",
   "Our experience was perfect. Our server explained the menu beautifully and offered excellent advice for both my vegetarian friend and omnivorous self. The texture of the house-made pasta was perfect and the dishes beautifully composed. The wine list is small, but expertly curated. Give the desserts a try - they are not overly large and are complex and delicious.",
   "We\u2019ve been here many times and have never been disappointed. The entree menu is limited but everything is interesting and prepared perfectly. It\u2019s a short walk to Krog Street Market and the Beltline from here. The 20 yolk tagliatelle and the black spaghetti are iconic here. The servers are passionate and knowledgeable about the wine list and the food choices.",
   "Stopped by for a light dinner.  Came early  without reservations so had to sit at the bar.  Not your typical Italian dishes.  Good service.  Flavorful pasta dishes."

   "Come here with my wife day after Valentine's day, was a great experience. Services was absolute amazing. Food incredible delicious. We enjoyed very much.  I highly recommend.",
   "We had a private room due to a birthday celebration/9 people. The waiter was pleasant. We started out with wine. The waiter suggested the seafood platter for the table as an appetizer. So we did. It came out and it was 2 giant cracked claws and legs and a platter of about 12 shrimp (cocktail). Our hostess was a bit taken aback as we all were because as this was not what we expected. That was basically 1 shrimp per person and we would have to share passing around and digging out crab meat. We expected a full fledge platter. This may work for 2 people but not 9. And it was $150 plus I believe he quoted $18 for the shrimp. The manager was kind enough to take it back for the miscommunication and left the cocktail. The food was very good though. Every thing came out correct no complaints with that. Only thing that could have been better was communication. We are in a room laughing and enjoying ourselves. Instead of bursting into the room, opening the doors, pulling them back locking them, starting to take things as if you were cleaning, (this was basically to tell us to get the hell out) he could have entered the room and advised us at let\u2019s say for example, you close at 9 tell us at a quarter til or just merely state \u201cjust to inform you guys our business hours end at or ending at....not to rush you but to inform you we will be closing down soon.\u201d Trust me we would have said thank you and exited. We were finish with our meals and only talking and enjoying one\u2019s company, no one was paying attention to the time. So it was kind of rude on how that played out. Outside of that, we would be back.",
   "I decided to give my husband a surprise party for his birthday and The Palm was the perfect venue for it.  We used one of their private rooms; and although it was the day after Valentine's Day, they accommodated us with no problem.  I did not have to worry about adhering to a minimum balance or extra fee for them slicing my husband's cake.  Establishments should understand that you can get more from the customers when you do not nickel and dime them with little fees here and there.   Amanda, the Sales Manager, was so attentive to every detail for me and provided insight to help me make the best decisions for what I was envisioning.  I did not have to worry about a thing.  The food was amazing and my guests told me multiple waiters were always in the room making sure my guests had everything they needed before my husband and I arrived.  I will definitely be going back to this restaurant again.",
   "Palm Atlanta is a very special restaurant. The manager Andrei always makes you feel like your occasion is the most important to his team at the Palm. The Palm Atlanta is an Italian Steakhouse that offers the best chicken and veal parmigiana in the city. The steak selection will rival any steakhouse in Atlanta. The staff has been trained to treat each guest, each occasion and each event like you are only people in their establishment. Booth 36 is the best seat in the house.",

   "Phenomenal jerk chicken at an unbeatable price point - that's why I gave it five stars. I've been to eats a couple times and only once was the chicken dry, but the flavour is still on point. The jerk fish was very herby and spiced plentifully as well, though do note that the portion is definitely less large than the jerk chicken portions.\nSides are great - note that the cornbread is savoury, not sweet. Beans and rice had subtle flavours that complimented the chicken well.",
   "I\u2019d never been here before, but came in purely based on reviews online. It lived up to all of its reviews. This is one of the best dang places to eat in Atlanta. Try the jerk chicken and Mac and cheese! I personally didn\u2019t like the cornbread, but everything else was tasty.",
   "This has been one of my favorite restaurants since I was in college at Tech. The jerk chicken is simply the best and you can't go wrong with any pasta choice. Trust me, I've tried them all.",
   "Salted cod fries. Who even knew that was a thing? Everything we ordered here was delicious. I especially liked the salmon entree I ordered. It was pretty windy the day we came so sitting on the patio meant that a lot of leaves was blowing into our food, but that didn't ruin the experience."

The place is vibrant, lively, and alive and fun. Our meals both evenings were delicious and everyone at our tables agreed. My best advice is to communicate to your server as to your taste. Try anything on the menu and be adventurous. One item I do remember is another diner and myself shared a larger seafood stew and the kitchen automatically served it on two plates. Nice!",
   "Very nice food! For starters, the octopus was delicious- sweet and spicy. I had the scallops, which were lovely, and a side of blue corn grits. The table also ordered the hush puppies which are delicious- almost like dessert. The ambiance is nice, but it is loud. Would be nice if the music was turned down a bit. Service was fine, nothing special, which I suppose I expected more. Overall, very nice evening!",
   "This is definitely a happening place.  You can sit at the oyster and seafood bar or reserve a table.  Everything on the menu looked too good.  We ordered more food than we can eat.  The oysters were fresh and tasty.  The scallops were of big size.  They were cooked perfectly.  The sides were generous portions.  If I come back to Atlanta, I\u2019d come again.",
   "Fantastic! One word reviews count correct? \n\nWhere to start? From the ambiance, the food, the service, all the way back to making the reservation, The Optimist impresses in every way!  We ordered a number of apps including a variety of oysters and everything was amazing! The seafood chowder (or whatever they called it) was the best I\u2019ve ever had, full of great complimentary flavors and substance! All of our dinners were delicious and were a family who shares so I\u2019m speaking for not only the opinions of my group but personal experience as well.\n\nI was here once before in the mid heat of summer, we sat outside and it was very spur of the moment and things were great! Last nights occasion was planned based on previous experience and were worthy of a full review!\n\nTwo words: Top Notch! If you like great seafood in a classy setting, this is the spot for you!",
   "Probably one of the most impeccable eating experiences I have ever had! My husband and I went for Leap Year to celebrate! Our waiter,  Brett was a phenomenal waiter and definitely added to our dining experience! Overall, we are super excited to come back. Definitely a jewel in Atlanta.  \ud83e\udd0d"

Highly recommend this restaurant and the squash pie!",
   "We ordered 2 new dishes & they both were equally delicious!\nNow the parking situation was a bit hectic, due to  traffic. I'm not sure if this is the norm or because it was a Saturday evening & the restaurant being attached to a mall. \nPlease be mindful of the valet & paid parking areas. The restaurant does not validate paid parking.\nAlthough it took quite some time to park, I'm still giving 5 stars. Here's why - we were 15 mins. late for our reservation, however we were seated as soon as we checked in (and they were busy!), our food arrived shortly after we ordered, all of the staff we encountered were pleasantly kind & accommodating, and the restaurant & restroom were very clean. So yes, 5 stars it is!",

   "Came here during a lunch and it was super busy and they still managed to sit us down very quickly. The food was so fresh and the restaurant was very clean. Our waitress Brianna was also super great, answering all of our questions since it was our first time. Great restaurant, did not disappoint.",

The waiters and waitresses always seem very happy and make the dining experience better. Great whether you\u2019re in a rush or you want to take your time."

The server was fun but knowledgeable. It was tough, really tough to decide what items to order and in what order. I certainly look forward to eating at that establishment again. I can understand why the place is popular.",
   "The is a tiny place and they have it loaded to capacity so it does feel a bit over crowded! However you will quickly forget feeling cramped once you start eating! The food is excellent! Everything I have tried there is amazing! I definitely recommend the gnocchi!!! The beet salad was extraordinary as well! While from a Manhattanite's point of view I would say the atmosphere is dress down casual the prices are a little more dressed up fancy but not unreasonable! If you are looking for somewhere with a laid back vibe great good and a polite friendly and attentive staff definitely check out La Tavola! You won't be sorry that you did!",
   "This place was great, bread, pasta, cheeses and wine were all top notch. The service was slow, even for a fine dining pace, took 10 min. To be greeted and another 15min for a bottle of wine. \nThe server was very knowledgeable and took great care of us after the slow start. The pasta and risotto were my favorite things we had. The New York strip was good, but nothing special. I would go back for the wine and pasta any time!"

   "Unique lemonade, a varied wine list, and crafted cocktails started our lunch with a blast! the starter jars were delicious - pimento cheese with bacon jam and fish mouse with mustard seeds were served with tasty bread. The super food entree featuring steak was very good with the steak perfectly cooked. The summer salad was also great with fresh blackberries and buttermilk curds. Lastly was the sea salt caramel ice cream. Our server was Tiffany and she was very helpful with the menu and was quite knowledgeable about wines. Parking is in the garage behind the restaurant and staff validates your ticket so bring it with you.",
   "Simply sublime. Food was great, especially the farm egg dish, very inventive and fun experience. Cocktails were also very week crafted and balanced (and well explained by exceptional staff).",
   "Empire State South was extremely disappointing and I would have given in 3.5 stars if possible. Everything just lacked any real flavor and was entirely too expensive for what we got. All of the dishes looked beautiful though.\n\nWe ordered popcorn as a snackie because it\u2019s not everyday you see that on a menu. It must be good, right? The mol\u00e9 it was tossed in provided little flavor and it didn\u2019t taste like there was any salt, which continued to be a trend. Especially with the squash appetizer with the little flavor coming solely from the ricotta cheese.\n\nWe wanted to order another appetizer but the disappointment in the first two dishes urged us to just move onto the entrees. Scallops for my wife and the strip steak for me. Again they were both good but lacked anything to make them really stand out for an acclaimed chef such as Hugh Acheson.\n\nAt the end of the meal we were left unsatisfied with the flavors and our fill. Especially for the money.\n\nI would not recommend Empire State South if you are looking for any bold flavors.",
   "Love this place! Great vibe, fantastic service, outstanding food! We went for Sunday Brunch and each meal was prepared beautifully. The Breakfast is definitely one of my favorites! It's definitely a great southern experience. A little pricey, but I'd say it's worth it! Also, it's a cute place if you want to take your kids because there's space right outside to play bocce ball or just hang out on the synthetic turf.",
   "Our server, Allie, was delightful and knowledgeable. The menu is tight and provides interesting choices in each category. Try the chips with white bbq, and rotating preparation of the tagliatelle. The restaurant itself feels warm and vibrant with peacock blue walls and windows overlooking the heart of midtown. We had just finished moving in nearby and we plan to return regularly. Thank you to the whole team!"

Thank you for a great experience, we will definitely be back!",

I had an old fashioned which was perfect. \n\nThe burger was insane. It\u2019s our favorite burger. And it\u2019s worth every penny. I had the new York strip, cooked perfectly, and we split cheesecake for dessert. The ambience is wonderful. The service is top notch.  Can\u2019t wait for our next trip here.",
   "This is a top notch and upscale steakhouse. I have a GREAT experience there. The service was AWESOME. I felt out of place a little bit because most everyone in a formal clothing. The bone marrow and escargot were good the grill butter sourdough  breads come with it was tasty. The tomahawk steaks was tender and flavorful. It's pricey but if you go into a high end restaurant you expect to pay.",
   "I celebrated my nomination last night in this fine place. I am glad to say that we had a pleasant evening and the restaurant was indeed one of the reasons for this fruitful meeting. The waiters  collaborated in a sweet style, the cuisine was extremely good and my guests were extremely  delighted. We shall surely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.",
   "When I asked the people of Atlanta that I came across to recommend a place to eat, Marcel came up a lot. So I made a reservation and ordered the Beef Wellington the day before. Great atmosphere, perfect for a romantic outing. The food was excellent, the beef wellington was perfect. The service prompt and professional. Definitely will go back when in Atlanta.",

The food was nothing short of amazing and the setting was so intimate and mood striking and of course we got seating with an excellent view. The prices were a bit high bit definitely worth every penny. If you want to treat yourself and your loved one.

   "Nice looking and highly appealing. Well located in a side section of Buckhead and easily accessible by walking from The Shops and nearby areas. They valet but gets busy weekend nights. The food from my experience was good but not outstanding which I would expect from this place. The attention is hit and miss. Ours was mostly good. Our bartender and assistant servers were great but our server seemed to be more dedicated to larger parties than the 3 of us. Overall is a see and be seeing kind of place. I would return for a biz dinner $$$$$",
   "Amazing experience. Our son loved the food. My household is full of foodies so a restaurant that meets all our expectations and deals with a sleepy hangry toddler likes a G",
   "Impeccable service! Amazing. My wife and I celebrated our one year anniversary here. I mentioned this via Open Table and we had no less than 4 staff members stop at our table to congratulate us, all using our names. It was an incredibly thoughtful touch that really made our evening. Of course, the food here is wonderful and the atmosphere warm and inviting. When we are able to go, we are always so pleased at how welcome we feel."

Everything was great from the cocktails to the appetizers to the dinner menu. Have your coins ready, it\u2019s not moderately priced, but it\u2019s well worth it. Great service, can\u2019t wait to get back!",
   "Everything! 5Church\u2019s Ansley is the best event manager anyone can hope to work with! From the very first response to my inquiry which was prompt and detailed, I knew there was something here as a potential proposal venue. She prepared a program within budget and assisted us with all our questions, plans and changes throughout the weeks leading up to the day of the event. \n\nAllowing us use the rooftop patio was the cherry on the cake and the views and pictures were all breathtaking. Thoroughly enjoyed doing my proposal here and every single one in our 36-person group enjoyed the food they ate. The place was clean, service was well organized and exquisite and we\u2019d definitely be back for more meals here!",
   "What a great surprise to find this excellent restaurant. First, the knowledgeable waitstaff are obviously well-trained and proud of their working environment. Secondly, the food was extremely fresh and tasty. Probably one of the best meals I've had in a long time! I had an excellent entree of scallops with a side of tasty brussel spouts that were wonderful Will return!",
   "Staff was really great. The hot day cooled off by evening and we ate outside on the second floor deck. Then a thunder storm. A bit off scrambling around, but everybody was cool. The food was excellent. My companion had stuffed lobster tails (hugely, wildly, overpriced and distinctly not local and pointless gastronomically speaking), but I had the shrimp and cheese grits which I took to be Atlanta-style. Best I ever ate.",
   "The atmosphere is chill, dimly lit, great decor for anything for a classy after work drink, semi fancy brunch, or a romantic dinner date. I especially love the well priced, excellently curated snacks during the social hour which I believe is 7 days a week (Absolute steal in Atlanta). The P.E.I. Mussels are my favorite thing on the menu and maybe my favorite mussels in the city. Must try!"

   "Phenomenal experience. Jonah Jacobson, chef de cuisine, absolutely killed it. Fried cheese, the best octopus I've had the pleasure of putting in my mouth, and lamb cooked to medium rare perfection. We will be back.",
   "We had a reservation and were seated promptly when we arrived. Our waitress, Ava, explained the menu and made several helpful suggestions. We decided on the tasting menu with a shared entree of trout. All the food was good - and served at the right temperature. Service was prompt but unobtrusive, and we never felt rushed. We\u2019d happily eat here again.",
   "We drive by this spot probably once a day for the last 3 years and finally decided to stop by on a weekday night for a meal. Upon walking in, the vibe and ambiance of the place were really good. The tables aren\u2019t jammed together giving us some privacy. The things you notice, or at least I do. Our server was a guy named Rudy. He was awesome to put it simply. One thing that stood out was how he handled an adult beverage my better half ordered. She wasn\u2019t a fan of it. Unsolicited, he jumped in and brought two other options out and one of those was a winner. We\u2019ve actually never experienced such proactive thinking. I was very impressed. Now for the food! Everything was done as you\u2019d expect. Flavorful & nice presentation, what else can you ask for. We ordered the three appetizers and a whole fish for two which I\u2019d recommend if it\u2019s your first time. No negatives to mention really. We\u2019d go back for sure. I guess it\u2019s fair to say that you would have to be into seafood at this spot. Lots of options from the seas of the world. Hope you enjoy as much as we did.",
   "The food is delicious. No complaints there. I do want to comment on our initial customer service. We were seated and forget about for about 15 minutes. There were a few tables seated after us that were given water and had their order taken before we were even greeted. Finally , we stopped one of the waitresses and told her the situation. She gladly took our drink order and served us but the initial engagement makes it hard to gauge if I would go there again. I did not feel welcomed. Again, the food was great, but I had high expectations for the overall experience and the first impression was definitely below average."

   "I took my grandparents and my younger cousin to The Red Snapper Seafood Restaurant for the first time on New Years Eve and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a more perfect experience. Our table was ready and prepared the moment we walked in and we were warmly greeted by both of the owners. From the moment we sat down, we were treated as royalty. Our drink orders were promptly taken as well our menu choices and every item came out hot, fresh and delicious. I ordered the blackened salmon and they had the fried seafood platter and both were scrumptious with great flavor, seasoning and portion sizes. I cleaned my plate! I also appreciate the fact that the owners took the time to greet us and introduce themselves, I felt that it really gave the visit such a personal touch. I really wanted my family to have an amazing experience for New Years Eve and the Red Snapper Seafood Restaurant did not disappoint. In fact, they\u2019ve gained new patrons that can\u2019t wait to return. I most definitely recommend this restaurant and hope you\u2019ll give them a visit so that you can experience their culinary excellence for yourselves.",
   "So I live directly next to this place but have never actually tried it. I always run by it and it\u2019s in a weird looking building so I didn\u2019t give it much thought. But one day, my girlfriend decides we\u2019re trying it so I decide why not? Well, we go and I order the Hess Chardonnay, and they bring it out in no time filled to the rim and chilled to the perfect temperature. I ordered the Snapper Gourmet and my girlfriend had the Mixed Vegetable Salad. Boy oh boy did our food come quickly and cooked to perfection. The Snapper was delicious and I\u2019m sad I overlooked this place for so long. 10/10 would recommend",
   "This place is my preferable site.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this restaurant. when  I feel like having a superb dinner, this place comes instantly to my mind. fresh and all kinds of  food and a large menu.courteous crew, and agreeable spirit. And very important, the cost is affordable. I sent my friends to this restaurant with pleasure.",
   "So I\u2019m honestly VERY sad about how my evening went here. See I had been coming here since I was a little girl - well over 20 years - tonight was my first time back after a while. It was like the place was completely different and I had no idea why - I later found out it was under new ownership \ud83d\ude22. The gumbo was remarkable in the past, I\u2019ve never had a complaint - tonight it was not, it didn\u2019t taste good. The snapper fingers were fried in what tasted like some kind of cheap fish fry. They used to be my favorite. They had a light batter on them before. These have now been butchered. Please get some of the old folks back In there so the taste of the food is what we all know and love. We used to love celebrating special occasions here but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back after tonight. I s xx mean it really saddens me to say this. My waiter was kinda jittery also. Very flighty. Kept a as forgetting things. Was dazed for a few seconds, it was very unsettling. I just want it back to the way it used to be.",
   "This was an impromptu dinner after leaving Lenox and so our first time here.  The food was GREAT.. !! \nTo start the Gumbo had substance and just the right spice kick... Snapper Yvonne  &  Salmon cooked perfectly!\nThe conversation, suggestions and service from  both John & Claire was excellent!!!\nWe will return and bring friends!!\ud83e\udd17"

Unfortunately my table was supposed to have rose pedals and a rose and it did not.  If you've never been.. Definitely go.",

She took some to go! I had the chicken parmigiana, it was pretty good. Could of used a little bit of salt and pepper.",

We specially enjoy the Saturday or Sunday\u2019s brunch specials served until 4pm; and we don\u2019t miss it when we\u2019re in town, once a month. The staff including Anna V & the team of servers are very professional, friendly, quick, and customer-focused; something you don\u2019t see in some high-rated and popular venues in town. We\u2019ll come back here and we highly recommend this place!",
   "Place is good. Came with a few friends for brunch on a Saturday morning. It was about 10am and it wasn't too busy. I should note that you will not be seated unless your entire party is there - even without a reservation. With that, we sat at the bar and waited on our late friend. Bartender was nice and talkative, but not so much they he became a part of the conversation. It's a solid menu with lots of egg based choices along with a nice drink menu. Multiple types of mimosas. I think the average price of mimosas was $10. There is also a burger included on the menu for Brunch. The French toast was excellent. Would recommend."

   "The food here is delicious. The service attentive and kind. I can only imagine that comes from good leadership. Love this place. Oh, and my husband has a gluten sensitivity and the entire menu caters to that. But you'd never know. It's not something they flaunt. It's just a really good restaurant that happens to be #glutenfreefriendly.",
   "The voltini is amazing. Fresh, crisp flavors with a hint of smokiness in the cheese. The service was awesome, especially given I showed up with a backpack and a plastic cup of tea because I'd just come from the zoo. The music sets a lovely note, as well. The white Christmas lights on the wall were the only off element in a lovely dinner.",
   "Incredibly skilled professional chef coming out with some delicious plates. Beautiful relaxing upstairs patio with a nice view of the park. Old fashioned on point.",
   "Nice staff, beautiful location and place, extremely price. The food is good. We order a casserole that was waaaaaaayyyyyy too much spicy. The drinks are medium, and I don\u2019t feel like I would come back for their coffee. Anyways, you pay for the place. It is a nice place if you don\u2019t care for good food.",
   "Stopped in from traveling.  Not very many places dedicated to gluten free so my husband (not gluten free) and I were grateful to find this restaurant.  Not only does this place have great food, it has a comfortable environment.  We had the orange marmalade cream cheese french toast, cheddar chive biscuit & herb chicken gravy, and cheesy polenta grits. They were all very good! The only down side was the gravy was cold (my husband ate most of the gravy and had some health issues a few hours later.  Perhaps due to cold gravy or might have been due to other reasons.) The restaurant and restrooms were clean.  I would stop and eat here again!  I also got some bakery items to go.  My niece liked the cherry pecan scone.  I would suggest anyone handling any food not touch food product with hands/fingers after handling other things.  I would like to believe and hope the situation was incidental or careless at the moment."

   "Modern Mexican cuisine in the heart of Atlanta. Great authentic mole, terrific service and a menu that makes me hungry just thinking about it. If I were a tequila drinker I'd have been tempted by their ENORMOUS selection (Mezcal too). Portions were huge and fairly reasonably priced. Definitely recommend.",
   "Visited while on a business trip and really enjoyed the food. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, which made it an easy experience.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Chorizo street tacos with the rice and beans as well as the potatoes. I was not a fan of the corn tortillas, but the tacos were great! I\u2019m not a rice and beans fan so believe me when I say the rice and black beans are delicious. They put fresh chopped tomatoes on top and it sets off the dish. The potatoes had a delicious Parmesan and tomato sauce and there were enough in one serving for the table to share. \n\nOverall, the price was reasonable for the tacos and the food was excellent. The waitress was a bit aggressive about us looking at the alcohol list, which was off putting, but not a deal breaker. I can say I had a great time and would definitely visit again.",
   "We like a lot to go out. Yesterday we came to this superb restaurant which we didn\u2019t know before. We enjoyed a lovely time there with excellent meal and an efficient team and an impressive cook. We put this restaurant in our phone list  and we shall surely go again very soon.  Highly recommended.",
   "This is seriously one of the best meals we've ever eaten. The flavors were sweet, smokey, salty and delicious. We tried the sampler of guacamole and salsas followed by the empanadas and then the tacos. We would actually stop in Atlanta to have this food again. Service was amazing and prices were reasonable. Highly recommended!",
   "Food was pretty good. Busy night so slow service. Overall it's worth a try if your around the area"

   "I stopped by for brunch on Friday, and I was impressed with the entire experience. It's a cozy spot in a nice location. My server, Brittany was very friendly, and helpful. I'm from out of town, and she answered my questions and provided excellent service. I had the Foul Play, which is chicken and waffles, with a side of hot peach, and it was wonderful. I cleaned the plate! L5P is an 8 minute walk through a quiet neighborhood with beautiful trees. I'll definitely return next time I'm in town.",
   "Went around 4:30 on a Saturday. Plenty of parking available behind the block of stores and restaurant. Sat quickly and brought glasses of ice water. Ordered the meatball burger and lobster rolls; both with the flat-top Mac and cheese. Food didn\u2019t take long to prepare. Burger was cooked well and very flavorful. Lobster rolls had a good amount of lobster. Neither of us were overly impressed with the Mac and cheese; not a fan of the cheese they used. Would like to return for the brunch or to try other menu items. Very \u201chipster\u201d atmosphere, but family friendly.",
   "This place is awesome! I HIGHLY recommend the pigs in a blanket. The grit fritters are okay, but they would be better if they were served hot. I also got the country fried which was alright when hot but definitely needed more country gravy. The chicken on it was perfectly cooked though. I also got the sweet potato waffle. I wasn't crazy about the peach compote but the chicken was perfectly cooked and the waffle was hands down the best waffle I've ever had. Definitely recommend.",
   "Holy mother of God...this food is delicious! We had the Randy for an appetizer which is bacon dipped in pancake batter\u2014-haaaalelujah. Then I had cinnamon bun French toast which was melting in my mouth. The inside is also ADORABLE and in the best location. I\u2019ll definitely be back!",
   "While the service was great and I loved the atmosphere, overall it was a pretty average brunch. I ordered two eggs over easy with turkey sausage, grits and toast. Eggs were good, though the turkey sausage was pretty low quality. We also were up charged for \u201cin-house jelly\u201d but we\u2019re not told it would be extra (same with subbing fruit for grits). The French toast was also okay. The eggs Benedict with salmon was probably the best order, though the food was about the quality you would expect for a very standard brunch you could make at home (nothing that special)."

Our waitress, Danielle, was great also. Even though the place was busy she made us feel like we were her only diners and she gave great recommendations. We will definitely be back and I will recommend it to anyone else.",
   "Good Service, Good quality of food (fresh), recently priced for the quality/food. The ambiance is good as well. Everyday they have a happy hour from 5-9pm with a drink at a good price and some bites. Best to make a reservation for dinner time since it\u2019s even hard to find a spot at the bar if you just walk in!",
   "A very clean and a friendly staff at this location.  We came in with a group of over 10 people, we were seated within 10 minutes and had a wide selection of delicious food options available to us.  Food was prepared and served to us in a timely fashion. The servers were very helpful and made sure that we had full drinks at all times. The after dinner wait for the bill was very short and the prices were very reasonable.  The atmosphere of the place was very laid back and comfortable for all of us.  I would definitely recommend this establishment for anyone who enjoys a good dinner, good wine and a family style dinner or casual drink and munch.",

The food was delicious and one of the treats were the garlic green beans.  I chose the salmon which was a great choice, however it left me wondering just how good the steak would have been.",
   "It\u2019s true, these are the best steakhouses. My steak was the best. Not a noisy restaurant at all and our server Lenny was great! A chain restaurant that continues to live up to its high standards. Absolutely recommend and it\u2019s located so centrally downtown. Perfect as it offers both outdoor and indoor seating.",
   "This is the first time I traveled to Atlanta with my mom.I browsed about most restaurants nearby hotel we stay,and Morton\u2019s meets my requirements for steak and seafood. I order bone-in ribeye 16oz(nice texture and well made but too too big for lady,the taste worth the price and Prime USDA),scallops and lobster was also a WOW.Side dishes as spinach with mushroom and jumbo asparagus were outstanding either. Nice service,nice restaurant!",
   "I celebrated my PhD today in this fine place. Well we had a magnificent evening and the venue was evidently one of the reasons for this fruitful event. The waiters  cooperated in a splendid way, the cooking was delicious and my guests were extremely  joyful. We shall absolutely visit again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.",

The dishes are consistently of high class, the attitude towards the guests  is friendly. I frequently visit this restaurant and I was never unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation."

The ambiance was a little lacking. (We went for lunch though) My date and I were dressed businesses casual.  She in a nice black dress and heels, me in dress pants, a button down shirt and a blazer, and they seated us across from a group of, what had to be, a teenage cheerleader squad, dressed in sweats and quite raucous.  Luckily, they left before our meal arrived so we could hear each other speaking without having to raise our voices for the rest of our lunch.  I would like to see how they address the dinner crowd before I pass final judgment on ambiance...so I will definitely be back!",
   "Really nice and professional staff. High end restaurant with stellar food. Pricy but similar to any other fine dining restaurant. I got the chicken and waffles came out in a very timely manner. I also really like that they give you complementary muffins to hold you over until the food is ready. Also the view is worth it all good I also like that you can go above where you eat and look through binoculars down into the town.",
   "You simply cannot beat the views and service.  I took my future Mrs. here and she loved it.  I do miss the fact it doesn't spin around anymore.  Prayers definitely go up still to the family.  I hope that one day it'll be allowed to turn again.  It's always great to schedule a time to go when it's still much daylight and watch the sunset into the night.",
   "Just left there and it was a wonderful experience. Staff was really nice. The server knew the money and made ordering drinks and food simple. She even took a photo of us. The Georgia trout was delicious. My bf ordered the seafood pasta and the from what I tasted the scallops were delicious. The vanilla cheesecake was also really good. I was disappointed that it still has not started spinning again, but I\u2019m sure they have their reasons. We did walk around and look at the view as well.",
   "The food was pretty good. Our waiter (Mike) was nice and accommodating. We were actually allowed to pack food-to-go in a fancy place with a special holiday menu. The view was beautiful at night, and the valet service was free when I mentioned it at the seating desk on the way out. Although I'm willing to spend money on good food..the meals were too pricey. Again the food was pretty good but not the best I've had. Half is for the view and top service, the other half is location. Will come back another time when the menu isn't for something special."

   "My husband and I are huge foodies and 8Arm has by far been our standout of this past year. You can count on Maricela to surprise you with all of the flavor and ingredients. I never thought I would enjoy a mushroom more than the way she can magically dish it up. If you\u2019re with a small group, I\u2019d recommend ordering the entire menu (it\u2019s smaller) and eating family style so you get to try everything! Bonus is that they source all their ingredients from local Georgia farmers so you can trust you are not only eating the best but supporting local!",
   "8ARM is a go to for me because I always know the food and drinks will be GREAT! You can always count of them to have some great season fare and libations to match. They are also open late so it makes for a great after event place to relax and eat.",
   "One of my favorite restaurants in Atlanta. Food is art here, and you can tell how passionate the staff and owners are with every bite. Love the changing menu. Love the vibe. Great service, always. (my kind of service. don't talk to me unless I talk to you. just tell me about the food I'm ordering and answer my dumb questions when I have them.) Great date spot. Great brunch spot. Perfect place for those who are looking for something different and fresh.",
   "Food was very tasty. We came through for Sunday brunch and there were literally 3 people waiting tables for the whole place, and only one for the outside (which was still just three groups). Everything else about the place is so cool but it was just frustrating to have to sit 2.5 hours just for one mimosa and a chicken biscuit. Mega bummer. ALSO MY COFFEE WAS ONLY THREE OUNCES AND I ONLY WAS ABLE TO GET ONE REFILL THAT I HAD TO GET UP TO GET. (See photo)\n\nI thought that was it. THE PAPAS BRAVAS CAME OUT WITH 8 TINY POTATO PIECES WHAT IS THIS OK ITS FOUR DOLLARS THIS ISNT EVEN A PORTION.",
   "Drinks were good. However, they need better accommodations or a better way to handle when it rains. It rained inside during the entire event, limiting where you can gather."

Now, the most important part the food! I love steak houses so I've been to quite a few and I usually look for the upscale ones to get a nice steak. KEVIN RATHBUN did not disappoint on that. Very good well seasoned NY STRIP 16OZ STEAK I ordered the OSCAR topping (crab) just amazing. Their jalapeno cream corn was surprisingly very GOOD! It wasn't spicy at all but great flavor throughout. Speaking of flavor you have to try the bacon appetizer(in the picture)!!!The mashed potatoes however were disappointing they taste like they come from mix or a box and the creamed spinach was a bit on the salty side. They did not have Crown apple (my favorite) but Amber suggested regular crown with some apple pucker. It wasn't the same but it was close and I appreciate her trying.",
   "Excellent steaks and other fine dining. The seafood is always fresh and the vegetables nicely cooked. Pleasant wait staff and a subdued atmosphere.",
   "Indulge! It's totally worth the price! I spent $150. The atmosphere was really upscale. Service was impeccable. The drinks were stiff, but tasty. I ordered the crab cake appetizer, the 20 oz ribeye, half size portions of the Mac and cheese & steamed broccoli. My drink of the night was the Old Irv. I had 2! Everything was soooooooo good! I even finished off everything with a slice of cheesecake for dessert.",
   "A perfect dining experience. Great atmosphere..My date loved the appetizers, especially the thick cut grilled bacon. The stakes was cooked to perfection and seafood  was amazing. Not to mention the deserts. I'll definitely be back again."

   "The ambiance is lovely. The wine selection...very strong and the server quite knowledgeable. The scallops were seared to perfection and creamy in the middle. The seafood risotto truly delightful (even though there was a bit of sand from the clam and mussel shells). The downfall was the special of the evening...the pheasant. The mushrooms and potatoes that came with it were excellent (overlooking the one bite of sand left on the mushrooms)...but the pheasant itself was very dry. I have had succulent pheasant on more than one occasion...so it CAN be done...just not this time. Overall I wish all of the plates had a little more color...each dish was a little too \"brown\"...more edible greenery (especially for the scallops and pheasant) would not have hurt anything at all. That being said...everything was good enough where I would come back and willingly try other dishes.",
   "Fantastic Italian restaurant. My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday and it was a fantastic experience.\n\nFood: The wine that was recommended a Tuscan blend paired really well with everything that we ordered from the mozzarella with tomatoes to the two pasta dishes. The pasta was excellent and fresh. Some of the best I\u2019ve tasted in Atlanta.\n\nService: the waitress we had was courteous, professional, and took excellent care of us. She made the dining experience that much better.\n\nAtmosphere: This restaurant is cozy and comfortable. This is the kind of environment I look for when I go get Italian food. Reminded me a lot of restaurants in Verona.",

Our waiter recently was very passionate about wine and we had a great evening with friends trying lots of different wines. Food is fantastic and we found the service to be excellent aswell. I\u2019m a regular at Italian restaurants and this is an excellent one.",
   "This is a very nice Italian restaurant. They have appropriate portion sizes and can help make an evening special. They have good drinks, within the realm of what is normally paired with Italian food. Their waitstaff are nice and accomodating. They place is very clean and more attractive looking than photos would suggest- its actually quite romantic and cozy. It is smaller than you would think, though, so I would make reservations on busy nights to be safe.",
   "Their homemade pasta dishes are undeniably the most perfect food to solve any problems in life. I\u2019ve had better pasta at Sotto Sotto than in Italy. The servers are so knowledgeable on wine, it takes the thinking out of it. Let them make a suggestion for your dish. Also, a great place for night cap drinks as their tiny bar is a great local gathering hole. ;)"

We just spent some time at the market across. This places uses a lot of seasoning in their food which I didn't hate, but if someone is very sensitive to strong flavors, be careful. Still, had a pleasant experience!",
   "There were five of us, and it was absolutely WONDERFUL. The cocktails to start were well prepared, and the wine selection for dinner was extensive. Two of us shared the Porterhouse for two, and they loved it. And the rest of us got single steak offerings and all were cooked to prefection (medium rare), and the sides were equal to the task. We shared - their sides are somewhat family size and enough for two. We tried the broccoli, risoto with mushrooms and creamed spinach, and all were delicious! The service was very good, and the atmosphere matches the service and food."

   "I love this place. We\u2019ve been coming for almost twenty years. The service is impeccable, ambiance perfect, food is so fresh and smart. Drinks and wine are always classy. Not only that they\u2019re crazy generous with the neighborhoods around here with fundraising and giving back. We love coming here on a date night, big family occasions, out of town visitors, rowdy birthdays, etc. Keep up the good work.",
   "I was in Atlanta for one day. My search for dining options produced fast food or overpriced results.  Agave's description seemed to fit that niche of local spot with good options at reasonable prices.  Their Southwest cuisine made me wish I was in town longer.  The food was great.  The atmosphere was cozy.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nToo bad the CV-19 issue shut down restaurants the next day.  If they offer take-out during the pandemic shut-down, PLEASE support these folks.  I'll make it a point to come back next time I'm in town.",
   "Stopped by Saturday night because we heard the food was good.  It was better than good.  Best meal I've ever had.  The prime NY strip was amazing.  And that's coming from someone that has never had a NY strip I've liked.  My wife loved her tuna.  Pic is after she started eating it.  Margaritas were good.  Salsa was super fresh and great flavor.   Food and drinks were reasonably priced.  Only small downside is the tables are a bit close together where we were but hey I understand they have a business to run.  I wish this place was closer to my home.  We will definitely be back!!\nBeen back twice since.  Food and service have been awesome!",
   "Food was good and portion sizes were large. Most things were reasonably priced as well. \n\nAll restaurant employees were super friendly and helpful. \n\nComplimentary valet parking helps because there isn\u2019t a ton of parking in the area. Wait times for tables can be long on the weekends and there isn\u2019t a lot of space inside to wait. There is patio outside where you can wait when the weather is warm.",
   "Great food and drinks! Had a peach margarita. For an appetizer, had southwest shrimp egg rolls - delicious! My friend had the beef medallions and I had the Tequila shrimp. They were all really good. When we arrived, free valet parking. Casual dress. Very nice greeter and wait staff. Chips and salsa - homemade. So good! Want to return to try guacamole next."

   "My daughter and I went here for dinner prior to going to the Fox to see a Wicked this past weekend. We arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation, so we sat at the bar, where Chris, the bartender took very good care of us. While they were out of the rum needed to make the drink my daughter wanted (not sure why the drink is still on the menu), we each wound up enjoying a nice glass of wine.",
   "Loved my meal and experience here! My favorite with the charcuterie. The soft cheese we had was amazing as well as the spicy salami. \n\nI had the rabbit gnocchi. The flavor was good but a little on the salty side and the gnocchi was a little too soft for my taste.\n\nMy boyfriend got the pappardelle and loved it! \n\nService was good as well. Would definitely come back and try the goat cheese balls next time.",
   "Great date spot! The atmosphere is perfect- I especially love getting to sit outside when it\u2019s warm enough. The food is so good and rotated occasionally so there are new things on the menu. My favorite of their classics is the fried goat cheese balls- they are so good and what I look forward to most when I visit.",
   "Have enjoyed Ecco plenty of times with the hubs but never a large group. 12 of us dined there as part of a business meeting this week. Our server, Nick, was on it. He gave me some coaching on ordering so I could avoid the terminal wait for apps and drinks that you sometimes suffer through with a large group. Everyone was thrilled with the selection and the noise level wasn't too bad - sure the folks on the ends couldn't talk across the entire table but it was easy to pull 4-5 folks into a conversation.",
   "Great menu and good atmosphere. Charcuterie was amazing. Duck entree was great. Service was outstanding.\n\nDesert menu was good and wine was dynamite. Easy in and out. Would definitely dine here again."

   "Absolutely gorgeous restaurant. My wife and had an awesome time here, we sat outside although it was a warm Summer afternoon. There were fans all over the place to kill the heat. And of course they have a large wine menu. I ordered trout and it was well cooked, and before that the fresh bread and butter was killer. All in all we enjoyed the vibe and definitely recommend the place.",
   "I celebrated my birthday today in this great place. happy to tell that we enjoyed a outstanding evening and the place was indeed the reason for the outstanding evening. The stuff  participated in a gorgeous manner, the meals were tasty and my buddies were very  overjoyed. We shall definitely come back again for more joyful events. Thank you very much.",
   "We have dined here for years. The owner, Arnaud , usually welcomes us as at the door and we catch up with him for a few minutes. The food is always spectacular, and the service is on point. Very traditional French. We\u2019ve always had great meals here and suggest saving room for dessert. The bread pudding is fantastic. You can sit on the patio year round, and note, there is a very private side patio if you\u2019re looking for a more intimate setting.",

   "Cute, authentic French bistro.   Eclectic styling.  Small menu.  Affordable.  Went for lunch and kept thinking it would be a really nice place to take a date.   \n\nNot stuffy at all.   Very cozy with a rustic vibe.  Clientele was a bit annoying, but hey... it's a French restaurant in the south.  What can you do?  \n\nHad the croque monsieur and French fries.   Very delicious. \n\nTeddy was upset that I didn't bring him leftovers.   See photo."

   "Enjoyed a great dinner. We did not have a reservation and were seated at a hibachi table within ten minutes of arrival. The food was very well prepared and tasty. The portion was more than enough, having enough for leftovers. We had the Hibachi shrimp and steak and scallops. The meals came with soup, salad, noodles, veggies and white or fried rice. I would recommend this restaurant.",
   "This was my first time having hibachi in years, and Nakato provided a great experience! The servers and chef were great. It was very entertaining to watch, and we got  LOTS of food. The teriyaki chicken was delicious, and the sauce they served made it even better!  It was my boyfriend\u2019s birthday, so they sang him a song and brought him ice cream with a candle, which was sweet. Look forward to returning!",
   "This place is really good. The food quality is also top notch. I ordered chicken and shrimp and it was delicious. It comes with bunch of sides such as soup, salad, and some apps (depending on what you select) and also fried rice. The chefs presentation was spot on too. \n\nTip: It gets crowded so have a reservation. \nTip: They cook vegetarian and meat food on sale grill. So that could be an issue with some vegetarian folks.",
   "The ambiance is nice, though it's high energy and therefore can be pretty loud. You can reserve seats at a public hibachi table or if you have a group you can get a semi-private room (there are also regular tables in a separate dining room if you just want you order from the menu). The value for what you get is just average I'd say since they don't give you very large portions, but it's a fun place.",
   "Service was really good. The food was good, however portions a little small for the price. The place was very clean looking and had good ambiance modern with history. The only issue I had was that a party of 5 without alcohol and no desert one appetizer cost $180.00 we didn't even get anything special. The other issue was you had valet parking so your obligated to tip and that adds more to the cost. Otherwise the place was nice and the food was good, not great when compared to other restaurants that charge the same prices."

   "Interesting craft cocktails. Very good whiskey selection. Pricey menu, but the bread was excellent, the squash was good, the chicken was amazing, the potatoes were epic. Not too enthused about the green beans or the pork (overcooked). The desserts were ok and the coffee was good. Truly excellent service, clean bathrooms and good cocktails made up for a few of the food misses. Overall, worth the price.",
   "Really great food! Chris, our server, was awesome and made good recommendations. We enjoyed it all. This was a special fixed price for Valentine\u2019s Day 2020",
   "Absolutely wonderful meal and service. We arrived early for our reservation but they were able to seat us right away (which I didn't expect). They accommodated my request for a mezcal cocktail and it was fantastic! My husband got the feast for 1 which was the steak with garlic. I got the coffee lamb with carrots. We shared the ricotta toast and waygu beef share plates. While all of it was fantastic, if I had to choose I'd go with the ricotta toast and feast. But honestly you can't go wrong here. The manager took my husband's coat and checked it for him, our server was kind and knowledgeable. Definitely worth checking this place out.",
   "We had a fantastic lunch at King + Duke. We visited on a Tuesday just after 12 without a reservation and were seated immediately without any issue. We sampled a bit of everything - drinks, pop overs, sandwiches. All were delicious. The service was friendly and helpful. I look forward to going back!",
   "Went for a birthday event. Table reservation was an hour late. There was complimentary drinks and appetizers for the mix up... host was very professional and knowledgeable of the entire menu. Ordered the most expensive steak offered (King 40oz bone in) along with the dry aged \"L bone\". Unfortunately for us the King was about 1/3 fat along with an okay steak. It was cooked properly, but was a poor cut of meat in my opinion. The \"L bone\" was not as tasty as I hoped. This could be due to the aging process though. It was a good cut with little fat on the meat anywhere. Others in our party had pork chops, they looked really good. Maybe I'll try those next time."

   "Enjoyed our dinner here! We tried quite a few things, the way beef appetizer was really fresh and juicy. Everything was great. But not used to the taste of the French onion soup here. The service was great and attentive. Since the restaurant was in a house, you will be seated in small rooms without a big crowd.",

   "Superb French cuisine. Lots of variety of choices, seasonal items and specials. Very friendly and attentive service. Ambiance that allows you to talk over your meal without having to shout."

   "I only give this place one star because at least the bartenders were attentive.\nWe walked in on a Tuesday early evening and asked for a table for 2. The hostess told us it would be about 45 minutes. My friend really looked forward to eating there and so I decided it was worth the wait. We went into the bar and were served two drinks and we went out in the lobby next to the hostess podium and sat down to wait. the hostess made no mention whatsoever during the entire time that there were any restrictions for priority seating.\nThere were about 10 smaller tables available when we started our wait. 1 hour past and we eagerly asked the hostess how much longer and she said \"when I seat this couple, then you will be next\".  She sat 3 couples between that moment and the 30 minutes that passed. We went over and complained and finally another staff told my friend that they had to seat the reservations from the hotel before anyone that is not staying at the hotel.\nWe were floored, we were dressed nicely, we did not feel like we somehow did not fit in but apparently this is how they treat non guests because two older gentlemen in business suits were also turned down. They had sat in the lounge waiting for about an hour also. Never have I felt so disenfranchised, needless to say I will never go back.",
   "Booked the hide out room for my birthday. Had an amazing time. Timothy made the experience unforgettable. He was funny, nice and attentive. The food was great and Timothy was even better. Best birthday dinner I\u2019ve had yet.",
   "It could have easily been a 5 star review but my brunch experience made it a 3. I go to AG about 1-2 times every month for dinner. The food, service and ambience(indoors) is great. The first time I tried brunch, the place was almost empty but it took the waitress over an hour to serve us.  I ordered breakfast potatoes but they gave me fries. The french toast was soooo small that I passed by McDonalds after my meal to fill myself up. No joke! I tried brunch again and my experience was just as bad with the long wait times although the place was empty. \n\nDon't even think about having your food at the terrace - it's unbelievably noisy from the cars driving by.",
   "Ribeye steak and brussel sprouts were really good. I asked for medium well and it came as described but it was a little dry so that's my fault. Next time I should get medium rare or medium. They gave free bread/scone with spices after I ordered and regular butter and spicy butter.",
   "As long as I've lived in Atlanta, I've never set foot in Atlanta Grill as most I probably thought it was to ritzy for even myself... but I was pleasantly surprised with the accommodations and great wait staff. Our waitress made the experience wonderful! The food was delicious they had pretty good choices. I think the best dish was the crab cake but we noticed everyone around ordered fish and chips. The banana pudding french toast is to die for and the birthday peaches and cream cheesecake was everything ! Red velvet chicken and waffles were a little mushy and didn't offer much of any other chicken and waffle dish. Price point isn't bad but they are smaller culinary servings. Definitely will return and I hope I get the same young lady on the wait staff... I believe her name was Magdeline."

Hats off to the chef!\n\nAlthough the establishment is small and parking is limited, this restaurant more than adequately serves its community, and walking to it from a few blocks away is worth it.",
   "A Mano's is a great restaurant.  The food, drinks and atmosphere are awesome.  I would highly recommend you try them out.  We will be back.  BTW Brendon (the bartender) was so talented.  He made our experience over the top!!!!!!",
   "What a great little restaurant!  I have driven past this place for some time and finally decided to stop in and see what it is all about.\n\nI love good grilled octopus and have eaten some of the best around the globe - the grilled octopus here is probably the best I have had anywhere.\n\nEveryone's food in my group was great, the service was attentive and drinks delicious.\n\nThe only issue is parking - they only have a handful of spots but there is usually street parking on nearby neighborhood streets.",
   "The best spot in the Old 4th Ward for quality and reliable Italian food. I\u2019ve been coming here since they opened and love that there are some menu items that haven\u2019t changed but still taste great each time (like the burrata & fusilli). I also thought the newest addition, butternut squash ravioli was a great option for vegetarians. Creamy and balanced out with the nuts & apple. Also enjoyed their peach soda, the lavender one was too strong.\n\nParking - limited lot parking, mainly free street parking"
