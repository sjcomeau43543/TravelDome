   "Fun place to see the old buildings. If you are there at Christmas time the light show is fun for the whole family. The underground tour is full of history. There are good places to eat lunch and lots of specialty shops. The train museum is really fun with old train cars and a old locomotive you can walk in. They also have train rides they are not lo g and the train moves slow but fun for kids. I would recommend this place during the day after dark more homeless people start coming around.",
   "A great little slice of history there is lots to see and eat. The California railroad museum is awesome and very informative.there is a pedestrian walk through over to the mall we can grab lunch at Yard House or anything there. Yard House has a great happy hour starting at 3 weekdays and old Town is not very busy at that time. There are lots of options to parking weatherby meter or in garage or at the mall with validation. One of my favorite places to go in Sacramento. Did the underground to her it was pretty informative and really cool.",
   "The train museum is really cool and gets five stars. There are few good restaurants but need more to do. Lots of empty shops and store front. Plenty of parking near museum. A few more homeless people laying around than you would like to see in a tourist area or anywhere really. Not San Francisco bad, but bad enough to mention. I hear lots of money going into the area but still has a ways to go. Fun during the day but pretty creepy at night. Streets lights aren't great and not many people, other than bums, when we were there.",
   "Definitely one of my favorite places. From the train museum to the candy shop to all the places to explore and eat. There's something for everyone on a day trip. Parking is a little hard unless you park in the structure and other than front Street most of the area is under construction so there's less to do. But we enjoy the experience. it is a step back in time. We find something new each time we are here.",
   "It's a fun place to visit if you haven't been there. I wouldn't plan on spending an entire day there, but there are some fun shops and nice restaurants.  The train museum near by is fun for kids. Old storefronts and boardwalks. Some grassy areas with picnic spots. You can walk down to the riverfront. You will have to pay to park here. Either meters on the street, or under the freeway."

   "Beautiful building. Highly recommend the free tour which starts on the hour. I tried grabbing a self guided tour map and going at it alone while on a business trip but the tour guide gets you into places you wouldn't think you have access to as the general public. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. The tour drops you off at the governor's office by a hallway which houses displays from every California county. It's fun to try finding your county if you live in California. Overall I had a very good time here when I needed to pass some time. Good for kids learning about civics and adults who are interested.",
   "If you've never been, I'd definitely recommend to go! I am a California native and have never had the opportunity to go visit. The location is beautiful and we'll kept. A lot of great facts to learn and perfect for a field trip.",
   "I came here to kill some time but ended up really enjoying myself! It is free, the building is beautiful, and you're free to roam around and watch Assembly and Senate sessions. There was a wonderful volunteer stationed near the north security entrance who let me know that the Assembly would be issuing an apology for the Japanese internment camps while I was there. I am so glad she mentioned it and that I was able to watch.",
   "It was SO fun to check out our Capitol. It's beautiful and has so much history. It was cool to see the different counties represented as well as one of the chambers. Also there's a nice garden area to walk around just outside the Capitol.",
   "At the State Capitol, the past, present and future of California interact with equal force. The building serves as both a museum and the state\u2019s working seat of government. Visitors to the Capitol can experience California\u2019s rich history and witness the making of history through the modern lawmaking process.\nHours:\nWeekdays 7:30 am - 6 pm\nWeekends 9 am - 5 pm\nAdmission is free\nTours available hourly\u00a09 am - 4 pm"

   "I love this place! Total train nerd here and I always can find something to check out at the Museum! Make sure you have enough time when visiting because the exhibits are amazing. Also make sure to watch the movie in their theater that explains how the big four came to create train routes out west.",
   "The best place to visit while in Sacramento. The staff and may I say volunteers are amazing! I don't remember the gentleman's name he's in his late 80s and he has been volunteering there I believe almost 32 years he was such a delight.",
   "This is a clean and well-maintained exhibition. The staff is friendly and polite. They are knowledgeable and give you a good insight into the history of railroading in California. If you haven't been by all means go.",
   "I visited this museum over 4 years ago and I have never forgotten it. I got the opportunity to go again and it's still as impressive as the first time I went. \nI love trains and this museum had really taken care of the trains they have. It's all set up in a very interesting way with a nice flow to it. \n\nThe docents have so much information and definitely have a passion for trains & history. It you or anyone in your family likes trains or history - this place needs to be on your list.\n\nThe trains are well maintained compared to other train \"museums\" I've been to where they have become rusty. They also have lots of great artifacts.",
   "It is really a neat experience for all ages and kind of a go-to place for us when we have visitors in town. In addition to a number of really interesting trains on permanent display, they also have a gallery that rotates frequently. It is a fun place to learn about railroad history. They have a nice model train display upstairs and a newly revamped kids' play area. After the visit, you can walk around old Sacramento."

It is worth going!\n\nI will warm you that the parking in some of the lots has a quirk: as of this writing, the meter in front of your parking space is NOT the one you pay and isn't always clearly marked.\n\nA couple years ago I payed the meter and the $42 ticket.",

   "My favorite museum in Sacramento. I have visited dozens of times in my life and I fall in love every time. Shocking mix of an old Victorian mansion and a clean white state of the art modern annex. Chock full of a wide range of art styles, mediums and age.",
   "Definitely Five Stars. Me and my family went together and it was absolutely wonderful. The atmosphere was great. I got so inspired while there. You also have free roam of pretty much everywhere in the building. The gift shop was also fantastic. The people working there and the entire museum were so nice. I am definitely going to go all the way back down to Sacramento so I can go there again."

   "Amazing place to bring your family. There's all kinds of animals here to learn about and watch. I had a good time here. You should definitely bring your own food and drinks. If you're visiting in the Summer, be sure to bring stuff to stay cool for everybody. Sun shades will be a must and sunscreen depending on the time of Summer you're visiting.",
   "This place is great! My little ones had plenty to look at, and plenty to excite themselves with. We had an easy time locating all the exhibits. The staff is both friendly and knowledgeable about the zoo. We ate close by the zoo at a great restaurant. I love the location of this place because it's so conveniently located in the middle of everything you May need/want.All in all i would declare this to be a great family fun zone.",
   "This little zoo is very well kept. We were fortunate that the animals were active and easily seen. My three grandchildren delighted in having such up close views of the animals. They also enjoyed feeding the giraffe. Activities such as this do have additional costs. This zoo is easy to navigate. You could spend an hour or all day    and learn something new about nature.  Animals in captivity are controversial. A zoo provides an opportunity for humans to experience animals. When a connection is made between humans and animals hopefully compassion is felt.",
   "This is definitely an amazing place to visit if you\u2019re ever nearby, especially with kids. The price isn\u2019t too high, and all the animals are treated with so much love and care their behaviors indicate this. I\u2019ve visited it several times and it never gets old, the gibbons have to be one of my favorite for their calls. I\u2019ve noticed people complaining about the animals not being out, and please ignore these people. The animals not being forced outside is a good thing, it means they\u2019re being treated with respect and care. And the volunteers and employees are so nice, respectful, and kind. Especially that one Grace, made the entire experience a lot better as her and her colleagues help educate the kids and they have fun with it too so they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re learning. The food too is actually really good, the stir fry was killer, and I\u2019d seriously buy it if it was in a restaurant. A lot of zoos feed you slop, but not here. And one last comment, if you\u2019re a kind soul please donate to this zoo, they care for the animals and they fundraise for animal preservation in the wild.",
   "We have a membership to the zoo, and we do not even have kids. Nestled right near William Land Park in Sacramento, you are able to get up close and personal with giraffes, lions, gibbons, meerkats, and so much more! With over 500 animals, including exotic and endangered varieties, there is something for everyone. They host special events, have a Zoo Train, and the staff are very knowledgeable about their inhabitants. There may be no way that you would ever think that all of these animals could be right in your backyard, but guess again! Please do something for yourself, and put this affordable outing on your calendar today...you will not regret it. No doubt that your children or grandchildren will certainly enjoy seeing the animals, but then again, so will you!"

They no longer have paper scavenger hunts in the kiosk as the website says.  We had a hard time finding one online as well.  You may want to visit first and make one yourself.  But I believe guided tours are the way!",
   "Neat historic site. Exhibits were great; just the right amount of information. They have actors dressed in period clothing. I typically don't like that sort of thing, but they were very knowledgeable and I enjoyed talking to them here.",
   "Sacramento has a rich history. Not the most tantalizing or salacious, but interesting nonetheless. Sutter's Fort is one of those interesting places that makes Sacramento unique. It's always interesting exploring the little nooks and crannies within its walls and imagining what life was like a hundred and eighty years ago.",
   "This is a fun random spot in the heart of Sacramento. It's interesting to hear the raw real stories of Sutter and early settlers. There was an elementary school class there when we were visiting. Apparently classes can visit, stay the night, dress in colonial clothes, and do fun old time activities. Definitely something to check out!",
   "We had such a great day here.  So much history presented in an interesting way.  A real look into the past and what daily life looked like. Fun for adults and kids.  Dont forget to stop by the gift shop...they have so many fun souvenirs."

   "It's a good first attempt at an iconic regional bridge. Although it offers good views of the east bank with Old Sacramento and the goose poop walk with the ziggurat building on the west bank, it could be much more walkable. Installing bubble machines, giving tours of the control room, and a grilled cheese cart would be nice touches that could help earn another star.",
   "The view at sunset is breathtaking with all the angles of the bridge and the glow of the sun reflecting off the gold.  You can also see the river and Old Sac from here.  \n\nAlso, have you seen the bridge when it's rising?  It's unlike any other bridge I've seen.\n\nSacramento has been my home for 16 years and I consider this iconic Sacramento. \n\nA photographer's favorite, be sure to stop by at golden hour sometime soon!",
   "Beautiful piece of architecture. A highlight of Sacramento without a doubt. As a backdrop to Old Sacramento and the waterfront district it is a must see.",

Many families take their kids here on weekends and its so nice that I have seen people doing outdoor photo shoots. \nI can sit here for hours just watching people walking and the ducks swimming while enjoying my espresso. \nSacramento can be crowded with so many different things. It is good to have a park like this.",

It includes a golf course, baseball field, picnic areas and to public stages.

Like you go inside a house and the climb stairs and boom you are ready to slide, crooked street walk was fun for both our toddler and my cousins 5 years old kid. There is a castle too. If there is no party going on you can go there too.",

Only downside is that the play structure is so large and tall a parent cannot just sit in one place to monitor children and the fact that there are multiple access points to outside the playground I felt the need to constantly follow around for safety as there were several homeless/transients very close.  \n\nEnjoyed the pond as well and children enjoyed watching the geese and ducks.",

Parking near the church is quite expensive, normally $10-$15, so I would suggest for you to park a little further so you don't have to pay the fee. The masses teach me a lot about different things that I could use in my life myself. The architecture looks really nice and you could learn a lot about how buildings were built in the 1880s, the Renaissance Revival times. I like a lot of Cathedral that I can't tell you right now, but I just love it overall.",

   "Do the underground tour, I like this museum you will be able to take some fantastic pictures and get a lot of historical information. Be aware it\u2019s not a large museum but plan like 1 -2 hours and you will have a great time.",
   "This was a great your. Sap was our guide and he was great. Very interesting to look at and listen.",
   "Only had a brief time to explore but some cool agricultural and historical info. A small section of old Sac Bee printing equipment and lots of nice displays of local artifacts. It's a great to shop around in Old Town and see the museum as well. Took the Sacramento Underground tour, which is good to do at least once if the history interests you.",
   "Great place to see what Sacramento was built on literally and figuratively! Beautiful tour",

   "Amazing place of history. They only allow you to take photos outside. Inside photography are not allowed. I don't know why. It doesn't matter. The tour was short, but excellent. Amazing structure. Definitely will visit again for a full tour. I'll post more photos later.",
   "Beautiful mansion that was the office of the Governor during the Civil War.  More recently it was the second office of Schwarzenegger.  The grounds are kept vintage Victorian.  The entire mansion and grounds are operated by California State Parks. Walk up Tours available...check the State Parks website for hours.\nI took these photos in the early morning.  The juxtaposed image of Victorian Sacramento against a 1960s high rise is beautiful.",
   "The mansion offers excellent free tours of the house. \n- You'll get to see what the house looked like over the years. The house and most of the levels showcases beautifully well preserved architecture and furnishings. Other levels show off what the house looked like when it was remodeled to become an orphanage. \n-The tour guides are friendly, interesting, and can answer pretty much any questions you can think of. Definitely pay this land mark a visit!",
   "A great historical place to visit! Can't beat the price! It's free! Guides in every room to give you some historical background. We will be back!"

If you call Sacramento your home I implore you to visit museums such as these and do a little \"time travel\" within a few thousand square feet.",

There is also a really cute 'fairy door' at one of them). Plenty of parking & people are friendly; the only downside was some littering but that is at the fault of the visitors not the park itself.",

Sadly I don't know what the outcome will be but,there is also a sewer/overflow plant being built in the same compound of the park. Residents I've spoken to in the Victorian homes are not happy. That is also why I gave a 4 out of 5 stars."

People say dirty water but it\u2019s got lots of shade from trees. I don\u2019t care about \ud83c\udf41 in water.  But the owner could fork out for more signs no directions \u2757\ufe0fNot a place for someone who wants super scary rides.",
   "Super pleased after our first trip! We bought season passes (which were super cheap) because it seemed to be the only military-friendly family park and the discount was unbeatable. \nPark was really fun. As a mom I was grateful to see so many lifeguards (actually working - I watched one quickly jump in after a little girl) who were attentive and professional. Security was on point. Parking was not far away at all either. My 7 year old loved the river and slides. Even my teens were happy. \nFood was a little pricey but it is a theme park so that\u2019s to be expected. \nWill definitely be back! Highly recommend!",
   "Slides were super fun and the park was really clean. I was surprised that the lines weren't ridiculous but, I should still have got to the park earlier. I wasn't able to make it to every ride before they closed but I didn't get there til 1pm",
   "This place is super cool for little ones to teens and young adults or mom and dads for their kids. This isn't as great for us older adults who like the big rides!! Sun splash is better for the older kids and adults but raging waters is a cool spot and your first entry gets you a season pass! Can't go wrong there!",
   "Average water park. Wave pool was pretty weak (4 inch waves --yawn--) No boogie boarding or rapids of any kind. A few decent water slides, nothing epic. The fair was pretty decent. Price was cheap for season pass combo fairgrounds / water park ($31). Food options were typical and normal fair prices (mostly high). Parking was good but a tad high ($15). Website and signs there show they open at 9am but it's actually 10am so we had to wait a bit. I'd give them 4 stars if they had any kind of rapids ride. The lazy river thing was meh. Seating was ample everywhere. Not too crowded even for a Sunday during the middle of fairgrounds season."

The duck pond is fun when the birds are around. There's plenty of open grass area. A little to uneven for soccer, but works great for letting my dog chase the RC car around. There are fun activities here all the time too. Last few times I've been the homeless WERE NOT A PROBLEM. Something you can't say for most of the other parks downtown. Great place for a family week day picnic.",

Nestled in a nice upscale neighborhood along the banks of the Sacramento River it is a treat and a half. Quiet, serene. Amenities are path for jogging and biking, fishng, Boat launch. Tennis anyone? Or if you want to just  relax under the trees lying on the green grass.  I just moved from Texas and there is no sitting in the grass. Besides the various bugs, fire ants are not fun nor friendly. Just one can ruin your day if they bite you. This is my hometown and I'm glad to be back after living in Texas over 15 years.  You can't beat the weather here in a park like Garcia Bend.",

It won't offer much of interest to older children, but that is not their goal. Highly recommended for the little ones and their parents and grandparents.",
   "I went to this museum on free museum day and had a horrible experience. It was my first time coming there, and I wanted to give my 1 year old daughter a chance to enjoy learning and exploring. Right off the bat, I was told by a worker at the entrance that I would need to wait in the extremely long line that stretched along one side of the building and continued out along the side of the parking lot. She said this in a patronizing way, telling me that it was free museum day (as if I didn't already know!), and treating me with very little empathy or concern. After coming to terms with the situation, I stood in line for a while, enough to know that it wouldn't be ethical to have my daughter wait with me, seeing as the line only moved 2-3 feet every 5-10 minutes. She was already fussing and about to cry. I think it would've taken upwards of 2 hours before we reached the entrance, at which point we both would've had sunburns and tear stains on our faces. I quickly got out of the line. Then, in a final act of desperation, I asked one of the other workers at the entrance if there was any way that I could bypass the line because my daughter was having a hard time waiting. She said no, with zero compassion in her voice. Needless to say, I left! And I must admit I shed a few tears over just how bad of an experience that was. I don't know much about how good this museum is on a regular day, but now I know that the staff there can be very cold and insensitive.",
   "Not as much of a museum as a play and create event. Lots for kids to do. Craft area, water area, dress up with stage, get and grocery store area. Kids love it... Just don't expect an actual museum. Staff is great and very attentive!",
   "This place was wonderful. It was raining outside for most of our trip out to Sacramento, so this was a perfect spot for our almost 3 year old. She had fun with everything there. The staff were amazing and responsive as well. No doubt the next time we are in the area, we'll be back!",
   "What a great place to take your children without a worries of them breaking something. The place is super child proof, staff is nice and caring. \n\nSpent 3 hours there also having fun watching my kids doing all sort of things, from driving a bus to entertainment in the water section.\n\nI recommend it for an indoors afternoon activity or any day."

   "My 12 year old wanted to do an escape room with her friends for her birthday, so we booked \"Pet Snatched\" for her and a few friends.  I didn't go into the room with them because that wouldn't be cool, but I did wait for them in the lounge area.  I could hear them laughing and talking excitedly during their time in the room.  They had so much fun, and I'm happy to report they escaped with almost 4 minutes to spare.  I would definitely book with them again, and I hope to get a chance to do one myself soon.",
   "So. Much. Fun!  We had a group of 10 for some birthday fun and we chose \"Conspiracy Theory\".  We did our best of getting out of the escape room and used only 2 hints.  We were SO CLOSE!  It's an experience that is memorable and I highly recommend it.  Our host, Michael, was hilarious and SUPER nice and helpful.  Thank you, Exit Strategy!",
   "We had a total blast at Exit Strategy Games! It was my second escape room experience. We booked Pet Snatched for four people, and it was just the right amount of challenging and has certainly made me excited to come back and try the other rooms. \n\nOur game master was Gigi, and we are officially her biggest fans. She joked around with us and made sure we were having fun and laughing throughout the whole game. I\u2019m pretty sure she barked over the intercom at us at one point to simulate the snatched pets.\n\nI definitely recommend the Pet Snatched room, especially for smaller groups! I\u2019m looking forward to trying out the Spy vs. Spy room and the Wizarding School room. \n\nIf you want to have a good time, go to Exit Strategy Games. And ask for Gigi!",
   "Awesome room! Michael was a great game master and got all my references :)",
   "This was a great escape room experience. The puzzles were challenging, but not too stressful for a casual experience. Our game master, Gigi, was fun, friendly, and helpful. I can't wait to go back!"

   "It's a beautiful park right on the river. Love the sunsets for I'm here.",
   "Low key park, great for family events.  You're able to fish at this park so bring your license and gear.  There are a lot of shaded tables and a few grills.  There's men and women restroom, no doors, soap, or paper towel.  Lots of people biking, walking and some with dogs.",
   "Nice little fishing spot. Boats where flying past here all the time. Didn't catch anything that day I was there. But that's how it goes, also you need to pay for parking. I forget how much it was. Not too bad tho. Not a LOT of trash but there was some. Overall, cool little spot. I will go there again sometime.",

   "Very cute with a toddler section. However, there were a lot of older kids in that area. Still my nephew enjoyed it and I could easily navigate with him. Cool looking fort for kids to play around.\n\nPlease clean the areas though, there was a lot of litter in the toddler area and ice cream on the ground. I wish kids would respect the park better.",

The deer and wildlife are so sweet to see and enjoy in their natural habitat.  It's my favorite walk and run trails.  3.25 miles around.  The blackberries are a wonderful treat in the summer!",
   "We love Main Event!  Great place to catch a game with a cold beer and fries (we love the sweet potato fries).  Service is great, you can sit on the patio and watch the first tee drives and swap golf stories with the locals.  Food prices are very reasonable, wish they offered a full breakfast though!  They also have a trivia night and live entertainment some weekends.",
   "Beautiful park with wonderful wildlife and bird watching opportunities. There is a nice building with some special animals and interesting information about the local fauna as well as some gift shop items. It's very inexpensive for parking and worth a visit for anyone who enjoys nature. The trails are ideal for a walk and the river is nearby.",

   "Just wanted to share this information with everyone, since Ancil is a local gem, and I see some confusion in the comments below...You do have to pay for parking....unless you visit the golf course or the pro shop. All it takes to get in is to tell the ranger at the gate \"pro shop\", and you won't be bothered further. I wouldn't go park at Effie Yeaw, that makes it pretty clear you aren't hitting the links. Hope this keeps more money in your pocket and less in the states hands."

The service was top notch, with continual water, and bread refills. Our waitress was amazing, and wonderful, making great suggestions, and checking on us regularly. The food price may seem a bit high, but every course was easily worth it's price. Perfect portions, and the food tasted impeccable. I will definitely be back.",
   "I went there for a Best Friend's Wedding. It was quite the ambiance. Certainly demonstrated a measure of beauty and elegance that fit the wedding reception quite well. The staff was very friendly. The food was very tasty. The drinks were well-made that goes especially for the cocktails. If I live in California I would certainly have more events here and definitely eat there on a regular basis but alas I am from the East Coast. I look forward to going back there one day",
   "This place had always been my favorite restaurant in town. Love the service her, it's always up to standard. I had my wedding her in January and staff was awesome, Randy was fantastic. Went above and beyond! This is a beautiful place to have your wedding if you haven't considered it. I would say this place is affordable once you add it up comparing to some places nearby. The Firehouse has a beautiful courtyard in the back and is lovely for an outdoor wedding.\r\n\r\nFood was delicious! All of my guest couldn't stop raving about how great the food was. I got the Filet Mignon and Daily catch duet plate for my guest.\r\nFirehouse had a wedding showcase once a year and I was able to bring my future mother in law to that prior to booking the Firehouse. She was able to sample the appetizers. From there, we narrowed down to what she liked, which made it easy to choose for my wedding menu.\r\n\r\nAll my vendors had a good experience setting up and did not have any problems on the day of (or at least no complaints). If you're thinking of having your wedding here and have outside vendors, don't worry about it, Randy will take care of it for you!\r\n\nAnyways I don\u2019t think my review does this place justice. Give Randy a call and he\u2019ll make wedding magic happens.\n\nOf course you can dine in and see if you like the food too!"

   "Amazing attention to detail. The food was outstanding. With each dish the chef would explain where his inspiration came from to create it, how it was constructed, and what was in it. Me and my wife felt like celebrities in their. Unfortunately I don't have any Michelin Stars to hand out, so I will only do what I can, which is write a review and tell all my friends and family to go experience this amazing restaurant. \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd17",
   "All the food was fantastically prepared, well-balanced, and the flavors were spot-on, if a touch on the salty side (which I like, but beware of you don't; this is the only knock).  Two main complaints:  the glacial pace, and a few blocks away, I thought, \"I could really go for some food.\"  The full plates vary widely in portion size/\"fill-up\" status, from what I could see, and not all are equal.  Mine had few, albeit tasty, bites.  They're apparently known for their tasting menu, so maybe give that a swing.",
   "Inconspicuously located, Localis has an interesting and delicious experience to offer. The staff was all pleasant and knowledgeable about every step of the way. We ordered the fixed tasting menu as well as a small plate and a large plate. The scallop course was a wonderland of texture and the octopus was cooked excellently. Would definitely recommend.",
   "I had the best 4course take-out tasting menu last week and wine pairing in little mason jars!! Delicious food & Amazing wine! Plus the fried chicken and dry Riesling wine pairing I picked up Monday was outstanding!!!!",
   "Make a reservation and plan for a long and memorable dinner. We had a 7:15pm seating and ordered the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing, we wrapped up dessert just after 10pm. There are no words to describe what an incredible experience the dinner was. By the time we got to dessert I forgot to snap a photo! This was our second time in and we will definitely be back any time we have something to celebrate."

   "This restaurant has consistently been a fantastic place for great food and great atmosphere. We take out-of-town guests here. They have a family-style meal once a month that is SO much fun! That's an experience everyone should try. We have done it several times. Very reasonable price and terrific food and fun!",
   "Extraordinary ambience and very amiable service. The meals were crisp and enchanting. Will surely recommend this restaurant to others. Reasonable rates and generous meals. Good job.",
   "I love this restaurant! They offer high class dishes, their menu is nice, The cook in that place is a specialist, I like very much tasting all their food. The dishes are consistently of high class, the service towards the clients  is good. I visit often this place and I not even once was disappointed.  I highly recommend it.",
   "Wonderful restaurant - the menu is true to farm-to-fork, with some very creative offerings. Well prepared and absolutely delicious. We started with the heirloom tomato salad which was large enough to share, and then had the pork tortellini\u2019s and duck for the mains. Perfectly done. Great bar, excellent, friendly service. It is a bit on the noisy side when the place is full, but it quieted down after a few tables cleared. Reasonably priced for a high quality restaurant...our waitress was nice enough to waive the corkage fee. The wine list has a lot of local wineries, also nice. Our only small complaint was being seated at the kitchen counter when we had reserved a table, but the hostess moved us to a two-top when we commented on that. The counter (see photo) is supposed to be a great place to sit, since it opens on the kitchen and the staff let you sample other dishes. Maybe next time...and there will be one.",
   "The ambiance is great! The smell of the food being prepared makes your mouth water in anticipation of the meal to come! There is a courtyard for small weddings or gatherings. Parking is hard to find due to the downtown location, but worth the walk if you end up a block away. I highly recommend this B&L!"

This Elegant Modern Cuisine food was served with a beautiful presentation and awesome taste. Chef T prepared Salmon & Grits for me, the best grits you'll ever eat. Salmon was cooked to perfection! He specialized my moms Vegan Dish (Vegan Burger w/ Baby Green Salad). If you have a sweet tooth, order the peach cobbler for dessert. Make sure to stop by while your in Mercer Island!",

If you haven\u2019t experienced the Kitchen, make your reservation today!!",
   "This place is incredible. Amazing service, fantastic food. They make the night so much fun and very memorable! (Depending on how much you drink) Obviously expensive, but worth every penny. You need to experience this at least once in your life.",
   "Fantastic and unique experience ....walking in the kitchen tasting food before we even sat down to eat was a real treat.  At one point I had a glass of champers an oyster and a cookie dough ball!!!  Definately high end cost ($$$$$) but we went all out. Staff were awesome and relaxed...but very efficient.",
   "This is a one of a kind dining experience. A foodie who loves fine dining this food was some of the best ever experienced. Not only is the food worthy of its Michelin rating, the way the meal is presented is super unique. You have an opportunity to be in the kitchen along side the chefs and servers watching the preparation, ask questions, observe plate presentations and watch table service. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly yet non intrusive to the whole experience. Worth every dollar spent."

   "If you want to surprise anyone for a nice dinner. This is the place. Very nice atmosphere. Music is great. Went there during first week of Jan. The outdoors area can be very cozy and warm. Expect to pay more than you are used to. This could easily be a place for a nice romantic dinner.",
   "A large, dark, romantic eatery. For fifteen years excellent meals have been plated for both patio and restaurant seating. As the night is comfortable, we sat on the heated patio.\n\nThe appetizer, \"Zucchini Chips,\" is a little like potato chips only so much better. Leah, our server, informed us the chips are vegan and fried in rice brand oil.\n\nThe accompany rustic Italian bread is served with both butter and olives oil with balsamic vinegar.\n\nThere are four vegan offerings. I selected the stuffed peppers which turned out to be delicious.  A half of both red and yellow peppers are stuffed with rice and white beans, given a kiss of a rich tomato sauce, then sprinkled with arugula. I drizzled a bit of the olive oil/balsamic vinegar bread dip on the arugula.\n\nThe meal finished with an incredibly rich raspberry/champagne sorbet.\n\nEverything is wheelchair accessible.\n\nThis is a very special restaurant and I highly recommend it.",
   "This is a really nice place to eat in the evening! They got either a nice patio or a dining room you could eat in! The service was really nice and pretty relaxed! The atmosphere was very relaxing, especially with the nice dark wood ceiling and candle lights. The light bulbs stringing around might have been a little to excessive, but the 2 small fountains is what really made the difference! For starters, i ordered the zucchini chips which were a pretty healthy alternative to regular chips! I had the burger for the main entree and it was cooked pretty well and everything from the bun to the lettuce felt fresh and crisp! The fries were salted and seasoned as well! I would come back here if i was in the Sacramento area for dinner! Hopefully they'll keep up their really good service and freshen up the menu!",
   "Very good food! The pork chop is a must have. It's cooked perfectly and is a nice big cut. You can't go wrong here..",
   "Their pasta melts in your mouth. The Risotto dish, was wonderful. All around the restaurant were happy faces. I enjoyed every bite! Will definitely come back to try the other entrees!"

   "Love Bacon & Butter and food is superb but would not recommend takeout during COVID.  They don't open until 9 and then get so many orders that the crowd descends at 9:45 like the website directs but it's another hour before you get your cold food.  I'll be back, but not for takeout - the system is just not organized enough for their level of popularity.  Maybe it would be better on a weekday",
   "Food was good.  Very popular place.  Long wait at 9am on a Saturday, about 30 minutes.  Once seated, food is served fast.  Friendly service.  Warm atmosphere.  I went with my best friend so of course we had a nice time.",
   "The food was excellent. The coffee was fantastic and frequently topped off. The wait was long on a Sunday morning, but totally worth it. I got the kitchen sink it was very good. Friends got the biscuit sandwich and the cinnamon roll and both said they were amazing.",
   "Great service, great food, clean place.  Don't let the long line dissuade you, I have never waited more than 15 minutes to be seated.  I would be willing to wait longer than that to eat here anyway.",
   "We went here for a breakfast date on 02.08.2020. The wait was about 30 minutes for 2 people which isn't bad for this place because it's always busy.\n\nThe food was awesome, we tried the chicken and waffles with a side of the house bacon. Drinks were average and personally a fresh orange juice or water or even plain coffee would have sat better.  \n\nThe checkbook of poems that you can sign when you're through was a nice touch that we enjoyed and I have photos of the pages we signed.\n\nPricing was reasonable. If you're willing to wait a bit, I would recommend this place."

I'd recommend this place for a romantic dinner, and for a large group, as it has a large room to accommodate around 20 people. Looking forward to returning soon."

   "Great food and a cute place. The place has a very relaxed and I pretentious feel. It is light, airy and comfortable. You order your food at the counter and then seat yourself. Service is quick and friendly. The food is fantastic! We had hush puppies to share. They were crispy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. The homemade buttermilk dressing is out of this world - creamy and flavorful and the perfect dip for the hush puppies. I ordered the fries chicken which again, was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. The grits were super cheesy but maybe just a tad bit under. That said, I still really enjoyed them. The corn bread had a honey butter glaze. It was good enough to be dessert for me. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go have a meal at South. You won\u2019t regret it.",

Because there is a 1\"1/2 lip at the door that I could not get over with my power chair! The door does not meet ADA standards! I'd like to thank the 2 people who helped me get Into the building! The food however is outstanding! As is the sweet potato pie! My wife and I sat outside and enjoyed our dinner along side another couple. However another couple who went inside to place their order and left their 2 teenagers outside to sit at their table, were chased off by staff  As I guess you can't keep tables for the rest of your family as they order   food for everyone else. As I said the food is great. However I could not get into the building without help from 2 other people. So we will not be back again!"

When we went for breakfast, same thing! Their potatoes were delicious. It\u2019s such a great atmosphere, and a pretty cool bathroom as well."

   "Service was excellent but food was just okay.  We had 2 family appetizers and mm7 entries.  My entree was the Mare or seafood.  It was good but a little too much sauce and mussel quality could have been better.  Overall, it was a good dining experiencw.",
   "Our first time at your restaurant left a lasting impression. First and foremost our waiter paved the way for an incredible dining experience. Jose was very kind and very knowledgeable of the dishes. \nI had mesquite Salmon and Pene. My wife settled in on the lasagna and it will be hard to go back without ordering the same two dishes. The atmosphere and table setting was superb. We will be back ! Complements to Jose and all who made our dining experience over the top!",

As was the chicken fried steak w/gravy, so tender, country potatoes and sour dough toast and regular Coffee was delicious. All in all I'd say food delicious with generous portions, pleasant family atmosphere and friendly staff.  I give Crickets - 5 Star overall.  Gotta try it, you won't be disappointed.",
   "Great restaurant, friendly staff who checked on us regularly to see if we needed anything. The food was great, bathrooms were very clean. Our food arrived quickly. I\u2019d recommend this place.",
   "This has always been the best steak I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve come here about 10 times and always order the steak. It\u2019s packed with flavor. The asparagus did mash potatoes  that come with it is also great. It is a little tricky to park but, the relaxing environment makes up for it. There are candles with sand at each table with a big water fountain in front of the restaurant and the lighting is great for the style of restaurant they have. I love it. It\u2019s the perfect amount of modern mixed with restaurant. The waiters are nice and friendly. The manager even gave my mom a free meal when she did not like the one she ordered before. The prices are a little bit higher than a normal restaurant worth it when the deserts come! The are absolutely amazing. I don\u2019t even know how to describe it. They come to your table and give you a tour of all the deserts they have. My favorite is the key lime with gram cracker crust. This is the perfect restaurant to go on special occasions!",
   "I love this restaurant. The food is amazing, and I love the ambiance. Additionally, they focus on using fresh and healthier ingredients for their dishes. I especially love that aspect. This is my restaurant if choice for special and intimate occasions. If you have not tried it, don't be fooled because it's attached to a mall. You will not be disappointed. I can't wait for my next opportunity to dine at Seasons 52.",
   "The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. Our server was great,  super kind and patient. The food left a little more to be desired. Chef was very light on the seasoning. Although it was good,  it could have had some more flavor. Don't know that I'll be back...maybe to try some appetizers but that's probably it."

   "This place amazed me! It\u2019s almost as if they don\u2019t abide by the laws of physics. \n\nI\u2019ve been going here before and service is always consistently good, but today just blew me away. This place must be very well managed and staff is extremely well trained.\n\nIt started when we were seated. It was busy and several people were in front of us, but the receptionist found way to find us and get us to sign in.\n\nWe sat down and before I could even warm my seat up they already had a table ready despite how packed the place was.\n\nAfter seating us they got our order within a minute.\n\nWhat amazed me was it felt like as soon as I gave the server my order, I took one glance at my phone I looked up and the food was ready in an instant.\n\nIt really amazed me.\n\nThe people to might left, and as soon as they stood up, the busboy took the plates, cleaned the table and got it ready within a minute or so. \n\nStaff was friendly enough and very attentive. Everything went like clockwork. The lady was able to check on us several times despite how busy the place was.\n\nI\u2019ve seen so many other restaurants encounter the same kind of rush hour traffic and they start struggle and Ryujin just cruises through it.\n\nReally great job to the management and the staff. Keep it up.",
   "Tried this place in the past with a friend and I am obsessed ever since. I liked the great atmosphere and yummy food and beverages. I recommend this place.",
   "Favorite ramen place in Sacramento that I\u2019ve been too.  Great selection of broths and toppings and everything I\u2019ve tried has been delicious.\n\nThey have a sister store across the street that serves ramen versions with thicker types of broth but I prefer the lighter types. \n\nCan be a bit crowded at certain time and parking can take a small bit of extra time, but well worth the effort.",
   "Absolutely love this place! This is by far the best ramen in town. The service is great as well, they're very fast and friendly"

The food was delicious and quite tasty. I left very full. Possibly more from those delicious chips they give while you wait\ud83d\ude01",

I could have had a bowl full of the stuff.\n\nI'd definitely come back here again.",

Unfortunately I'll be back because the food is good and it's close to my job.",

   "The lighting and decorations were great we sat at the bar because it was a little bit packed for the time we went. No complaints there\n\nWe were instantly greeted and the bartender really cater to our needs.  He explained the menu and listened to our wants and was very conversational and compassionate.\n\nThe food was very good and quickly plated, I am a meat eater whilst my girlfriend doesn\u2019t partake in eating meat. We both found something we could eat and be satisfied with.\n\nThe prices are affordable and the serving sizes are moderate, so if you\u2019re looking for a cozy place to grab a Tapa in downtown Sacramento give this place a go",
   "Great food, but I didn't like how fancy the place was. Fancy restaurants always make me feel bad about myself, I never think I'm good enough to be eating there. I would have preferred if the same food was served at an establishment that looked more run down, like IHOP or something. To try and mask my insecurities, I ended up having a bit too much wine. I got to the point where I was talking too loudly, but was also aware enough to realize I was talking too loudly. I kept apologizing for talking too loudly before anyone even told me to lower my voice. It was like every time I spoke, I surprised myself by how loud it was. It would have been nice to have been a bit more drunk, then I couldn't have realized how obnoxious I was actually being. The tables around us must have been grateful when our food arrived because then I couldn't talk as much. My dad and I ended up splitting the paella. He felt it was very salty, I thought it was too, but it was perfect for me because I love salt. Overall, we had a good time, but I can't say the same for the tables around us.",
   "Best tapas place in Sac. Their paella is bomb. Takes 25mins to cook, please order it with your apps order. Totally worth the wait!\n\nUpdate (2/9/20): stopped by for dinner again. Loved it again. Amazing service and awesome taste as always. This time around I ordered paella the moment I sat down as it takes 30mins to prep. Had scallops, lamb, ahi tuna tartare. Please check pics!"

The food was fabulous. Give them some business during quarantine, they deserve it.",

My brother in law (BIL) had the fish and chips. I had jambalaya, and my wife had a sirloin steak. Everyone liked their meal. The service was good, the employees friendly and the atmosphere, pleasant. I would return to this restaurant and encourage you to give it a try.",

   "We were so disappointed in the service we received, or I should say,  \"lack of service\". We got one of the worst servers we've ever had. She waited on all the tables around us and completely ignored us. We had asked for water several times and she never brought it. We saw her visiting with her coworker for about 10 minutes and then she brought water to other tables in front and behind us.  When I tried to get her attention she snapped at me and said she would get to our table when she was finished waiting on the other tables. She was horrible! We I had asked her to refill our empty water cup several times and she didn't do it. She was not only rude, but then she went to the table behind us and started talking to them about us. For that reason we will not be returning. We were so disappointed due to the horrible service by this particular server. She needs more training."

I admit I ordered the cheapest entree on the menu, which is out of the ordinary. I ordered the burger without lettuce. The burger showed us with lettuce which was disappointing but easy to remove but the flavor of the meat was not worth $20.00 for a burger. A known CA burger joint known for an easy in n out would tastes a lot better and has a lot less grease.",
   "Food quality, taste, and service was all far under what it should be for the cost. When we arrived we waited 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were there. No it was not busy and I had eye contact with the bar tender two different servers. Finally one server said hello and they will get the host. Another five minutes waiting and I believe the manager sat us without even apologizing for making us wait and having none up front. \n\nNext the food was bland and dry. Our steaks lacked flavor and tasted as if they were previously frozen. My rid eye had no marbling throughout the steak which is very odd for a rib eye. The lobster tail was undercooked and had the flavor of tap water and the texture of instant mashed potatoes. \n\nIf you are going to spend 300 bucks for dinner there are so many other places where you'd get better food and way better service."

They also had really nice fries that were kinda crispy and paired nicely with their ranch.",

I have been to many places where the burgers are good, but fries are decent, but this place has both. Finished it off with a strawberry shake which was fairly simple and basic and nothing super special. Would come again if we ever in Sac Town.",

I loved the barbecue carrots.\n\nThis place is perfect for everything from a romantic evening out to a celebratory dinner to a get together with friends to a quick stop to get dessert. Personally, I'm going to find every excuse to stop by.\n\nThe dessert is out-of-this-world! Make sure you save room.\n\nThe staff are fantastic! They're friendly, professional, and the work together to provide an elegant dining experience. You truly feel like you can relax while they take care of your every need. My water glass was never more than half empty. \n\nIf you are looking for the full dining experience, this place will not disappoint.",
   "Really delicious! Went here with my boyfriend for Valentine's day. Highly recommend the oxtail. It literally melts in your mouth. Best thing on the menu. P.S. their menu changes like every 6 months. Oh and their pineapple/basil cocktail is strong but doesn't taste like alcohol at all -- dangerous but good!",
   "Well crafted cocktails.  Good wine list at very reasonable prices including a nicely put together wines by the glass.  Good selection of beers.  Service is efficient.  Space is a very loud, so certainly not romantic.  Good is artfully presented but the quality of the ingredients and the execution falls short.  At this price point, you should receive balanced nuanced flavors.  Instead, most dishes were over salted and reflective of a single note.  Dessert was a complete disappointment.  Nothing local or sustainable on the menu, oddly.",
   "The food, service, and atmosphere were all phenomenal. There wasn't a thing that our group ordered that wasn't delicious. The crispy Brussels sprouts were especially outstanding and the banana cheesecake dessert was really special. I would never have thought that Szechuan pickled pineapple would taste so amazing.",
   "We finally made it to Canon and we can\u2019t wait to go back! The food was fantastic. Our duck was perfectly cooked. The consomm\u00e9 was unctuous and flavorful. The dessert was also a standout. Definitely worth a visit!"

   "Honestly, I was confused. The meal started with a Mediterranean meatball, then a Cajun risotto. It was awkward to walk into. The dining room had 8 diners at 6:30pm. They stacked all customers on top of each other, even though there was plenty of seating. My risotto was bland and was all kind of one note. Could\u2019ve really used some acid. The dessert was fine. I don\u2019t understand putting a a whole leaf of mint as a garnish, it\u2019s pointless. If you want mint in the dish then incorporate it. This should\u2019ve been a great dining experience. Historic location with great ambiance, except no music to drown out some of the loud chewing from the other tables. That said, the bar seemed to be popping and I really regretted eating in the dining room",

   "Dined for our 16th year anniversary. Very relaxed atmosphere, we opted for alfresco dining. \nOur server, Jen was awesome. She knew when to come and when to give us our space. \nThe food was delicious as always. Reminds one of home and a warm hug from Dad. \nSee pics for what we ordered. \nAn awesome start to our anniversary week off! \nThanks Magpie Cafe, we will be back.",
   "Food was great. Drinks were fabulous. Service was a little slow.",
   "This place was great! I got the hummus and vegetable bowl with a 6 minute egg. The egg was perfect and creamy. The humus was delicious and creamy. The vegetables were all deliciously seasoned and crispy not soggy. The sourdough bread that came with the dish as well was tasty. Wish I could have tried more, will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.",
   "One of my fave brunch places! Magpie has fresh, healthy ingredients. Their selection is great! I have loved every single thing I\u2019ve ever had there. Addicted to their house-made granola. Love their avocado toast. Great view of the park and a fun outdoor patio. A must try if you haven\u2019t been there yet! Just talking about it is making me hungry! Can\u2019t wait for Saturday, think I know where I\u2019m gonna be eating breakfast. \n\nDinners are great too! Their pork tenderloin is melt in your mouth! I typically eat brunch here but I\u2019m sure their dinners are all just as delicious!"

   "Finally made it to Frank Fat's downtown location. A group of us stopped by for dinner after a conference and they were able to quickly accommodate us. Everything is ordered family style, so we got 5-6 dishes for the six of us. It was just the right amount for everyone and we finished all the dishes. Everything was delicious and full of flavor. The staff were wonderful, from the hostess helping my friend get gum off his crutch to the server checking in the perfect amount. I also placed a separate order to go and it was done very quickly.",
   "Excellent experience at Frank Fats. We were in town for a conference and stopped for lunch before heading home. The food was excellent, and the service terrific. Everyone was engaging and helpful. There were 4 of us and we all ordered different dishes - everyone loved their food. Will definitely visit the next time we are in town.",
   "We were lucky to get a table without a reservation. The ambiance was good, staff was very friendly, food was good. We especially liked the spring rolls and immigrant beef. The banana cream pie was awesome. I would definitely go back.",
   "Travel to Sacramento a lot for work and this has become a staple for delicious food every time. Highly recommend the honey walnut shrimp and the immigrant beef. The restaurant itself is really beautiful, art deco asian decor along with some items with history behind them. The menu tells you more about them which is really cool.",
   "I celebrated my PhD last night in this fine place. Well we passed a sensational evening and the venue was undoubtedly one of the reasons for that strong evening. The team  helped in a graceful style, the cooking was extremely good and my friends were very  pleased. We shall no dout visit again for more events. thanks very much."

   "Beautiful place, super vegan friendly! My friends loved it. There\u2019s a bit of a wait so I recommend reserving a spot around 30 min before (depending on what day you come, we went on a Saturday and it was PACKED) the service was absolutely amazing! My waiter literally made a sauce (Francis I think his name was) like combined a couple of sauces to make me a honey mustard sauce\ud83e\udd27super sweet guy & super genuine. I was happy with my meal but expected a little more, maybe I just not a very big breakfast sandwich gal but I\u2019ll 100% be comming back to maybe try their chicken & waffles or a different brunch item! (Nice bathrooms as well, sinks are public)",
   "How did I not know about this place!  Everything is gluten free.  So many delicious options.  The staff were very friendly and informative.  Weekends expect a 20-30 minute wait to be seated.  Worth it!",
   "Got there at about 8am, so just beat the Saturday morning brunch rush by a hair!  I love the open atmosphere and fresh ingredients.  Food should feel good in a body, and my deconstructed lox fit the bill!  Had a brown sugar latte as well, which was not as sweet as I expected, but exactly as sweet as I'd hoped.",
   "I\u2019ve been here a couple times now and the food is very good for gluten free food. Comparing the food to normal, gluten-full food, it would fall short. But keeping the category strict to gluten free, it\u2019s definitely at the top. I\u2019d warn hungry visitors that it is often a 30+ wait to get a seat and then a good long wait for them to bring out the food from the time you order.",
   "Always worth a stop even if I'm not staying in or near Sacramento. If I'm even somewhat nearby I make a point to stop here. The best gluten free vegan options I've ever seen in a restaurant. They're also so clean and modern it's really a beautiful spot. We LOVE pushkins!"

The kitchen was dark and empty, pots and pans sitting idol. How can you make good Italian food w/o simmering through the day...before 3pm? I'm guessing all sauces are Costco frozen and warmed just before opening. Just boil some noodles and call it good?",

   "Delightful mid-town eatery. Unique menu printed up daily--today's focus: Southern. Our group of four put a decent dent into sampling the selection. Not one disappointment. One happy customer here.\n\nDo be sure to order the Purple Cow Cake!\n\n['19/11 1st try/review]",
   "I was SO not impressed with their food. I sat in the bar area and the best thing about this place was the bartender who took my order. He was very nice, talkative, and engaging. The food, on the other hand, left so much to be desired. The presentation of the food and portion sizes were plentiful and mouthwatering; however, the food did not taste good. The flavors were odd and extremely disappointing. I ordered the Roasted Brussels, an appetizer, and they were probably the best tasting of all the other dishes I ordered. I also ordered the Candied Yams; there was absolutely NOTHING candied about them. Yes they had brown sugar and marshmallows, but they were NOT sweet or bared any tasty resemblance to the candied yams I was raised on. I also ordered the Collard Greens. SMH. Maybe some people like their collards sour, or tart, but I do not. I like collard greens, not mustard greens, which are usually more sour than collards. I was VERY disappointed. Lastly, I ordered the Apple Walnut Slaw. Again, disappointing. However, it has a vinegar base and not mayonnaise, so that may have been why I wasn't a fan. Finally, they charged me $3 more than what the menu indicated, which is weird when their menu changes frequently. Ultimately, I took the food with the intent to give it to a homeless person, and lo and behold, there was a young man with a sign reading, \"Just Hungry,\" near the Arden Fair shopping area. Just his luck tonight. I probably won't be coming back unfortunately. I was hoping the food would have been better.",
   "Charming place that is actually bigger on the inside than how it looks on the outside. There is a variety of brunch and side menu options. You can go basic or try a specialty item.  Their menu does change depending on what they have in store. If you find this on their menu when you're there,  you have to try their cornbread. It was so good,  put some butter and jelly on it and let it explode in your mouth.  Yum yum yum!Parking can be a challenge but just be patient, and you'll find a spot. This place is like stepping on your grandma's porch.",
   "Southern charm and decor to match. Everything looked really appetizing from the menu. Nice to go with groups. Had the shrimp pirlo and it was great. Wanted to try the chicken but was told that would always be on the menu and went for a seasonal option. Will be back to try other choices. Service was excellent as well.",
   "this place has a full bar with a good selection. The staff are friendly but the food was just ok. There's a good selection of all the fried food you could ever want. Fried chicken with unseasoned. The vegan meatballs had a tangy sauce but crumbled when as you eat it. There was quinoa everywhere. Just really hard to eat."

   "FYI: this visit was about three weeks after they opened. It was a busy Saturday afternoon. We waiting for a party of 10 about 15 min. We called ahead of time and let them know what time we were coming but unfortunately they had to split is up to accomadate the size. The waiter was good and are good came in a very reasonable time. I wad taking back a bit by the pricing but taste wise I can't complain. I haven't had the flavor combo of the green tomatoes since I left the south. My chicken was crispy and tender. The parking out front is very limited but they have overflow parking around the corner next to the bookstore. The bar has television but the outside seating was not being used on my visit.",
   "There has been a bit of a buzz with this place. It's definitely worth every bit of the hype. We did have to wait about 15min for a table but that's expected when a place like this is so popular. I tried the pimento cheese dip which was meltingly good. The fried chicken was so darn crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. The hot chicken sandwich is like the name says, hot. But a good hot. The Mac and cheese and potato salad were delicious as well! I can't wait to come back to have more chicken. And try the other sides.",
   "The chicken is fine. \nThe mac & cheese is fine. \nThe beans and rice are fine. \nWhat isn't even fine was the $10 peach cobbler soup. It was liquid when in a plastic container. There were bits of pie crust dumped in it. I didn't want deconstructed peach cobbler soup. $10!",
   "It was our first time here and I will definitely be back.  Started off with the deep fried deviled eggs, the filling was great, as for the white being deep fried, not necessary.  The catfish was light and the cornmeal batter was flavorful.  I don't like hush puppies much anyway, these were fine.  The Mac and cheese was very good with lots of good cheesey flavor.  The collard greens were excellent, only place I have found around here that makes them as good as my wife, these were sweeter than hers, but a very close second.  I would come back for a big bowl of these.  My daughter had chicken strips, 4 big pieces and fries, they were good.  My wife had the shrimp and grits, 5 or 6 big shrimp in a delicious sauce that got spicier the more you ate it.  The service was great, our waitress was busy, but did an awesome job.  We will definitely be coming back, I want to try the rest of the menu.  The best southern food we have had in Sacramento.  Keep up the good work.",
   "Love the food. Came out pretty fast too. The only reason that I did not give 5 stars because of the slow service. We actually got all of our food too before we got our drinks. I think our server forgot about it. Had to asked another server for it."

At first, we didn't even know where the entrance was. It's really mysterious. When you are in the restaurant, it feels like you are in a secret vampire cave! The food is exceptional. Try the Beef Stroganoff. The bread is also yummy. The staff is friendly too. Try out this hidden gem!",
   "I never rate anything 5 stars unless its the best. This place was amazing. The location, the atmosphere, the staff. Staff ushered us to our reserved table promptly. Wait staff never let our water or drink glasses go close  to empty.  Food was amazing, from the appetizer to dessert, i was overly impressed with everything",
   "This place is obviously one of the most attractive restaurants in the region. Anytime I come to this place I am awfully pleased. They preserve their very high  level service and the highest level of food  they serve. You definitely will enjoy this this restaurant. Highly  recommended.",
   "This spot is the one I always prefer. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this restaurant I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very chummy and the cuisine they place on your table is so yummy. I never decline to have a decent dinner in this restaurant. I highly recommend this place.",
   "I gave this restaurant 3 stars because i liked the beautiful brickwork. The inside is worth seeing. \nThe food was okay for the price. The beef cheek stroganoff was okay the biggest twist being the dill. I was happy that the meat was tender, Not chewy and did not have gristle.  \nMy husband loved the scallops and said they were the best he's had in a long time.  \nOur dinner friends had the fried chicken which they said was breaded well and very tender. \nAll of us agreed that our favorite part was the artichoke dip appetizer which came with crunchy potato chips.  Even my husband liked it,  (he usually does not because restaurants often leave the chewy harder leaves in with the dip which he doesn't care for),  but here it was diced tender leafy creamy perfection. \nI thought the price was way too steep for the food, and it was very very loud. The waiter left much to be desired.  But.... we all really did enjoy going and loved seeing this building as well.\nI also appreciated that the bathrooms were very clean and had lots of room.\nWe loved that this place was so close to the theater. (We were attending a show later so it made it easy)"

We (my girlfriend and I) walked in on a Monday night and to our surprise it wasn't very busy.  A few tables open, no one at the bar, and multiple tables finishing up, and seemed like a mellow night.  The hostess was nice quickly helping us and asked if we had a reservation, I replied no but looks like you guys aren't very busy.  The manager walks over and starts messing with the computer when I over heard him tell her that it would be a 25 minute wait.  Uh a 25 minute wait huh?  He looked at me with a very pretentious look and I felt like walking out immediately, but the hostess offered us a seat at the bar, which I didn't care for but we sat anyways.

   "Gourmet Italian food with great taste, but selection and size can be lacking. Parking is on the street only unless you're handicapped where there's one space in the back, so parking can be challenging when busy. Main dining area echos a lot so having a conversation with your table is very difficult when there's a loud drunk party across from you. Oysters were fresh and excellent. Overall, service was friendly but understaffed so our waiter was ultra busy while other staff helped out. If possible I'd give an extra half star for a 4.5 star rating because I still enjoyed my dinner here with friends!",
   "Modern take on Italian. Emphasis on seafood but also has a separate vegetarian menu (be sure to ask for it!) The wait staff was attentive and friendly. Large wine selection. Chic / clean ambiance"

   "We visited here on a Saturday afternoon before a concert at Golden One. We were seated quickly and our server Tonya gave us great service. Both the beer and food were very good. Plenty of seating and nearby parking.",
   "This place is the one I like best. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this place I keep coming back again and again. The stuff is very welcoming and the cooking they place on your table is so yummy. I never miss an opportunity to have a good dinner in this restaurant. Highly recommended.",
   "I visited this place for a girls night out and loved it. The ambiance and food is great. Great for a date night or just hanging out with friends or watch the game. I am a beer fan and loved their options for beer. Must try the monkey ale beer :)",
   "Great place to meet for lunch or dinner. The menu has large variety. Some of my favorites include the grilled salmon salad and the wild mushroom pizza. The beer is always fresh and delicious! The waitstaff is very knowledgeable and attentive. I come here every time I am in Sacramento."

   "The wait staff here is some of the best, and most enjoyable people i have had as servers. The food is super fresh. You cook it yourself at the table if course! Also, bring your appetite because this will be an eating experience like no other. We ordered the yin&yang martinis throughout the night and loved it all! Can't wait to go back.",
   "The food was just okay. Nothing that I\u2019d return for, even at half the price. The service was slow and our server was not very attentive. I was expecting a 2 hour experience but watched other servers get their tables out a good 30 minutes faster than our server got us out. When you\u2019re waiting for a hot minute between courses, you people watch. Other diners' meals seemed much more seamless. Our server would check on us and we\u2019d be almost finished with a course (maybe 2 pieces of something) and he\u2019d tell us he\u2019d check back in a minute. 15 Minutes later he\u2019d show back up. My husband wanted a cheese fondue but I didn\u2019t. Either I got it or he didn\u2019t. What if someone wanted it who dined alone? They\u2019re stuck with 2 portions? Let\u2019s just say I was not impressed.",
   "Cool place for sure!  Ambiance is amazing and food was even better. Server was on point and treated us newcomers well!  I would have done five stars but wasn\u2019t a big fan of our table. It was in the corner and it felt a bit cramped!  I will be eating here again but will be requesting another location.",
   "Get ready for an experience.  This is dining like nothing you've ever had. First off, let me say that they validate parking,  however,  if there is an event, you may have a harder time finding parking.  We were greeted warmly, and assisted quickly.  The customer service was on point and our drinks were always full. The food was absolutely delicious. You can try the 4 course meal for about $50, or you can pick the courses you want. The entire meal took about 2 hours and it was definitely worth every penny. I suggest making a reservation in advance.",
   "We love the melting pot! We go here for almost every special occasion. The food is wonderful, the service is stellar and it isn't just dinner, it is an experience! Plan to be dining for at least two to three hours. The mood is romantic and upscale, but you'll stool feel comfortable showing up in jeans. The manager Casey is a gem, so if you get a chance to talk to her you will be happy you did!"

   "I would expect a MUCH higher quality from employees here, especially considering that it\u2019s supposed to be a high scale restaurant. Super unfriendly staff. This is the first time we came here to check out the place and were really excited, but have no desire to come back. We entered from the parking area (which is not the main entrance as we figured out later) and didn\u2019t know where to go for the seating, so we came up to the waiters\u2019 station where 2 waiters were standing. We stood there for like a minute - they gave us a weird look once (like why the heck are you standing here), twice, and only then bothered to ask if we need any help. When we came to the host\u2019s stand no one was there. After she came back to her stand she was doing her stuff for some time and only then asked how can she help us. After we found out that they don\u2019t have any tables available due to reservations we went to sit at the bar. Again, waited for some time before the bartender took away previous customers\u2019 empty glasses and threw the napkins for drinks to us.. when we asked for a menu he gave it to us and said that it\u2019s better to hurry up with ordering as they\u2019ll switching the menu in 5 minutes. At this point we felt super uncomfortable with the treatment from all the staff that we just got up and left. Went to a \u201cregular\u201d scale restaurant where apparently all the staff smiles and is being friendly. It just doesn\u2019t make sense - when you go to the high scale restaurant you expect a special kind of service, and it turns out to be completely opposite.",
   "Very tasty. Expensive and SUPER packed. Met good friends for dinner and it was their choice,  we most likely would not have ever been otherwise. If you like a crowd and dont mind spending a pretty penny, I think you'll enjoy this place. If you're frugal and/or like an intimate feel-steer clear.",
   "We like a lot eating out. Yesterday we  visited this magnificent restaurant which friends recommended to us. We had a lovely time there with fine dishes and a well-trained team and a talented chief cook. We  added this fine restaurant in our phone list  and we will certainly come back soon. We highly recommend.",
   "We met with friends at this spot for lunch. This spot was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, we were not disappointed. we were warmly welcomed by the staff members  and we had a great feeling. The meal was great. We loved this place a lot and we shall definitely come back again. Highly recommended.",
   "The atmosphere was spectacular, our food was flavorful, beautifully presented and took a reasonable amount of time. We also sampled a few different cocktails and enjoyed all of them, and Miguel our server was friendly, attentive and mindful of our needs. If you want somewhere to go for a special occasion, make a reservation and you won't be disappointed."

   "If you want a 10/10 atmosphere this is the place. We got dinner and drinks here and the only spot they lost points were in the drinks. We sat at the bar before getting seat and order some from the bartender. They were tasty but had no traces of alcohol in their mules, kind I\u2019d disappointing to say the least. Food was great as well as the service. I would suggest another place for drinks which is disappointing because they have such a great bar for it.",
   "One of my coworkers recommended Hook and Ladder for lunch. We arrived and there was plenty of seating available for the lunch hour. I ordered the burger and it was one of the best burgers I have had. It was very flavorful without being greasy. The fries are also very good. Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal.",
   "We went early and found the place nearly empty. Throughout the morning, customers came in and started their own meals. This isn't an unpopular place, just that it's a bit quiet that early. The food is really good and we're looking forward to going back in the near future.",
   "Walked in at 4:15pm by myself for dinner. I travel a lot for work and just needed a place to sit down and eat. This is not a place for that type of thing. It was happy hour and they were just doing appetizers. They were fully booked for dinner at 5pm. I just wanted a place to sit down and eat, now I have to figure something else out. Will the next restaurant I walk into simply let me sit down and eat? Hopefully. I was simply searching for quality, unfussy service and found the opposite here.",
   "This is such a great brunch spot in Sacramento! We were on the hunt for a good place to eat and spotted Hook & Ladder and got curious. While the interior is spacious with plenty of seating, we were seated outside on their cozy back patio which seemed to hide itself away from the bustle of 17th & S. The food was outstanding; they had something that satisfied each of our tastes and diets. Drinks were also on-point, having a good selection of beers, wines, and mixed drinks, we were more than satisfied! Service was excellent and couldn't have asked for more! If you've never been here, try this place for sure!"

   "Loved the locations and it seems this place provides a bit better customer service than the Broadway Location. Parking might be an issue for some but there is space throughout the residential neighborhood. What really made me give this place 5 stars was the customer service. Normally it doesn't seem they provide refills on some of their drinks but they were happily to oblige. Selland's has always had a good selection and the quality is what I have come to expect from the other location on Broadway which I have visited on numerous occasions.",
   "Arrived just as the restaurant opened. Met friends there for lunch. Ordering is easy. Menu is posted. Paying for food was quick and efficient. I ordered the Crab Louie. Crab was fresh, lettuce was crisp. Salad accompaniments were fresh and flavorful. Ordered salad with dressing on the side and that's the way it came. Every item in the display cases looked yummy. Staff friendly and helpful. Parking is limited. You may have to park on residential streets.  Be mindful of neighborhood parking restrictions.",
   "We came here with a party of four on a Friday night before the Epic Obstacle Course Race. \nYou seat yourself and we found a table in the main dining area, but it was pretty busy, so I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s pretty difficult at peak times. Our hosts, natives of the city, were astounded and told us it was hardly ever that busy (classic them). \nWe ordered at the counter and the price was very reasonable for two people and a dessert to split (and booze!)\n\nLemon Chicken Breast-\nMy wife and her high school friend both had this. The high school friend said that it was one of his favorite dishes, which just shows how much he\u2019s grown, emotionally since graduation. Adulthood is loving lemon chicken for low it\u2019s low carb, high protein ratio. He had it a la carte, splitting the large salad with his girlfriend. I didn\u2019t hear any complaints about the quality from either of them and the bits I ate when they weren\u2019t looking were delicious. \n\nTeriyaki Chicken Thigh-\nI chose this with a side of mashed potatoes and it was fantastic. It was lovely and juicy, with the bone in to preserve some of the flavor of the meat. The skin was slightly crisp and caramelized. It paired well with the mashed potatoes because of the great combination of salty and savory with creamy and buttery. And because anything potatoes is delicious. \n\nAsian Salad- \nMy wife and I split this cold salad between us but I ended up eating most of it because that is my lot in life. It was similar to a Costco salad, with mandarin oranges and the sweet sesame dressing, but it had a great crunch from the purple and white cabbage. \n\nMashed Potatoes-\nThis is one of their more popular side dishes. It\u2019s made from potatoes that have been \u201cmashed\u201d! Who knew?\n\nBroccoli-\nPretty standard steamed broccoli. Inoffensive flavor and a kind-hearted, spiritually-satisfying portion. \n\nGoat Cheese and Apple Salad- \nThe native Sacramentals ordered this and were generous enough to share an amount of it (it was massive). Lovely mix of sweet and savory. Definitely a great summer salad. \n\nCarrot Cake-\nWhile this cake was made with carrots, it does not have all the inherent health benefits one would expect. However, this is my wife\u2019s favorite cake, so, inevitably, I ate most of it. \n\nDouble Chocolate Cake- \nTwice the chocolate of a normal cake! What\u2019s not to like?\n\nOverall, it was very cool experience and the staff was super helpful and patient with us, considering we made our choices and then completely threw them out when it was time to place our order. They gave great recommendations and, ultimately, helped us stop panicking and decide what to eat.",
   "We absolutely love Selland's and have always had a great time there. Their food selection is excellent and everything we have and there is delicious. My favorite is their Eggs Florentine Pizza with added prosciutto from their brunch menu. I recommend this place for any time you want to dine in or takeout, but their brunch is phenomenal!"

The beef/lamb gyro was filling and the meat tasted great. The Petra fries were also a treat without being too overbearing. Try the fry sauce!

I've been here like five times and no matter what I order, I am completely satisfied. In fact, this restaurant is in my top 3 suggestions to family and friends. \nParking can be a challenge. However it's downtown so it's not a surprise. And trust me, this food is amazing!!!",

Food came out at a nice pace- enough to really enjoy each course.\n\nThe charcuterie plate was nice. We asked for their pairings with the wine we ordered, and the cheese monger had some nice selections.\n\nBoth the mac and cheeses and grilled cheeses are great- I can especially recommend the \"Not Your Mom's Mac\" and the \"T-Brie-D\". \n\nI can't wait to go back. If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out on a FANTASTIC dining experience.",
   "I went here very briefly with a couple of friends one day. They have good wine available as well as some other interesting options. I didn't try anything on the menu other than the wine, but we took a look, and the happy hour looks great.\nIt is a super cute interior, small and cozy, with a little classy (has to be with the wine and cheese, right?)\nThe waitress was very friendly and helpful. She gave us a sampling of the wine we got before we went all in for a glass.\nGreat experience overall, and I hope to be back for a Happy Hour soon.",
   "We stopped by here for some lunch and the food was really good.  It was really pricey though, so I knocked a star.  We got a Charcuterie Board, 2 grilled cheese sandwiches, a cup of sour and 2 beers.  Cost us $100 bucks.\n\nThe grilled cheese was good, but should have been bigger at those costs I think.  The service was great though.  Our server (Britney) was super awesome and deserved this shout out for her outstanding service.",
   "FlameMango - best grilled cheese of my life. They additionally have an excellent selection of wine and beer and do build-your-own cheese boards. Great vegetarian options as well. Mac n cheese is decadent.",
   "Yum. All I can say is yum. From the cheese board to the beverage selection The Rind never disappoints. When you are in the mood for a classy take on the ultimate comfort food there is no other place I'd recommend. Adult mac and cheese + grilled cheese for the win!"

   "This is a very cozy place with a mello atmosphere. The food was delicious. I had the rack of lamb and the muscles. The lamb was cooked to perfection and seasoned beautifully. The chefs were light on the salt so you could really taste the flavors. I would highly recommend trying the rack of lamb. The muscles also were full of flavor but left me wanting more of the sauce. This is a nice place to go for small parties or a date night. I definitely want to try other items on their menu next time I go there, I will definitely be going back.",
   "I celebrated my PhD this evening in this excellent restaurant. I am glad to say that it was a pleasant evening and the place was absolutely the reason for the outstanding evening. The team  contributed in a very nice way, the food was tasty and my buddies were very  joyful. We shall absolutely return for more events. Thank you very much.",
   "This restaurant is obviously one of the most attractive place to eat in the neighborhood. Always when I go there I am deeply satisfied. They maintain their very high  standard service and the highest level of dishes  they provide. You are always happy with this restaurant. Very  recommended.",
   "Good food great service. This is an old school chef run restaurant that never disappoints. They pay attention to the details and it shows in everything from decor to food and service.",

   "Fantastic place to grab some dinner. Nice atmosphere, good food, and cold drinks. \n\nWait staff is super friendly. Everyone is so pleasant. \n\nMeal was fantastic. Started with fried pickles and onions as an appetizer. Saved a few of the fried pickles to put on the Tavern Burger. Good choice.\n\nI would definitely come back here again.",
   "This is such a great spot. I love their patio with the dogs allowed. Service has always been good, often great. The food is yummy and a good range of options. Drinks are great.\nI like the look of the place, nice open area inside with wood and tile. The only downside to that is how loud it can get.",
   "Looked on Google for a good Sacramento lunch and was rewarded with trip to the Iron Horse Tavern. \nWow, a great lunch ! The Cuban sandwich was first rate and with a \u201creal\u201d ginger beer, a delightful meal. I was lucky to find a parking spot, it\u2019s a little tight, but worth the effort.",
   "Stopped in for dinner on my way to Tahoe. Great location. Near plenty of other bars. Food and service was excellent. I'll be coming back here amd highly recommend.",
   "They have good French donuts. Perfect place for a brunch. Lovely patios."

   "I don't think I have ever been here and been disappointed. The food, no matter what you get, is always consistent. I have never had a bad steak here-always cooked perfectly and tastes phenomenal. The sides are \"shareable\" (I don't like to share tho) for two people. Extensive wine list available and of course a full bar. I enjoy being able to come here and enjoy an upscale meal without having to put on a ballgown.",
   "One of the best steak houses I have ever been to. The staff was very friendly and super helpful. The price was a little high but for the quality of food and service it's worth it. They bring your steak out on a 500 degree plate to keep your steak warm the whole time you're eating it. They also bring out a selection of knives to use. I will definitely be going back some day.",
   "Very nice place for a special dinner.. impressive first date location.. engagement/proposal restaurant. Food was good. Service was great, prices was hitting them pockets but it was very good.  (Get the sweet potato casserole and you won't need a dessert)"

The happy hours are another good reason to go here.\n\nPlease do ask for their complimentary bread during lunch. It's delicious. \n\nI'm docking a star as the fries didn't feel that great during the happy hour. They were kind of chewy, and I didn't feel like they were freshly made.",

   "I will start with the good. We had reservations for our anniversary.  My husband had been telling me about this place a d I was so excited to try it. We got their early and I was happy that they could seat us early. In fact, the place was pretty empty. It took a server 10 minutes to get our drink order. We ordered appetizers,  which mine was wrong. There was absolutely no pacing of the meal. We had appetizers,  salads, and our dinner on our table all at the same time. We ended up having no less than 3 servers that night. Getting drink refills was almost impossible, but the place was empty!! Parking is a total nightmare around there too.",
   "Food was very good. My only compaint is they didn't have any of the complimentary bread they usually give out and the baked potato was over baked. The carrot cake was super moist. I would come back to this location.",

   "Espa\u00f1ol is a really fun place to eat Italian food.  Yes that's right, Espa\u00f1ol is a really great place for Italian food!  The four of us celebrated my wife's birthday.  The service was outstanding; they kept up the good service throughout but did not intrude at obvious family moments, very smart.  We had spaghetti and meatballs and raviolis what's great meat sauce.  Of course, they started with a standard salad with blue cheese or Italian or French dressings.  Then, came a wonderful minestron\u00e9 soup that they kept bringing as long as we wanted until we had our fill.  The entrees reserved as we finished our soup and salad; in other words, they paid attention to the progression of our dinner and waited until we had finished soup and salad before bringing us the main entrees. I like eating establishments that pay attention to detail and do not clutter the table.  The pricing of the menu items is priced well, and I would say moderate.  Not only would I recommend Espa\u00f1ol, but I give it five stars for it is a great family atmosphere too!!  Espa\u00f1ol also has a nice cozy little bar that serves bottled beer, wine and liquor.  I like Italian food and we'll be revisiting Espa\u00f1ol!!",
   "My parents took my Husband and I out to Espa\u00f1ol. And I have to say this place is amazing...Has a historic touch, with a home like feel and of course the food was amazing. You can get dishes with spaghetti and ravioli. Comes with salad, soap and warm bread. I got the eggplant Parmesan for dinner. Yum!! Family friendly and great for big events too. No need for reservations but would help with big groups.",
   "My daughter had spaghetti and meatballs; I had spaghetti and ravioli combo. I wasn't expecting authentic Italian cuisine, but I figured a place like this should be solid, tasty Italian-American food\u2014a classic red sauce joint. But I was disappointed by the food we got: everything was pretty bland, and the meatballs were dry and chewy. I'd rather spend less and go to The Old Spaghetti Factory.",
   "9 of us came here for a birthday celebration. Love the service here. Friendly personable service. Plates cleared, water filled in a timely matter. Minestrone soup is still very good. The pasta is just alright. The go to dish is the fried chicken with garlic. The chicken cacciatore is another favorite. The pork chop was dry and tough.",
   "Great Italian food just like mom would make. Dinners come with lots of tasty soup, salad and ice cream. Reasonable choice of dinner wines. Would recommend for a nice family dinner."

We ordered a French press coffee, a bourbon cold brew coffee cocktail (their cocktails are delicious), a Kale Caesar salad, the breakfast burrito and the tofu scramble and potato hash. The food was really tasty, big portions but didn\u2019t feel bloated after. Nice artsy atmosphere with really friendly staff. Highly recommended!",
   "Had brunch on our first visit, cozy but spacious upstairs space, price point $12-$18 per dish but portion size was very generous. Staff were friendly and food was amazing. Great selection of teas, beer choices more limited. The chicken (fried oyster mushrooms) and waffles was especially delicious. Will definitely visit again.",

   "This place is so delicious. The coconut curry is incredible and the potato wedges (YOU GUYS, THE POTATO WEDGES) were incredible. It is a bit more! We paid about 12-16 a plate and drinks are around 5, but the quality is more than worth it. \nAnd the ambiance! It\u2019s a nice upper story restaurant with a view and some calm music. The service is great! I\u2019m going here again for sure!"

A reservation for 8 that didn't show up on time and a table of 2 that lingered at their table for almost an hour after paying their bill caused seating to be tight leaving a cold and drafty table by the door our only choice. Make a reservation if you choose to come here and stay away from the table by the door and you should enjoy yourself. Cheers.",

I will reserve the right to \"bump up\" my rating when we have an opportunity to revisit this restaurant on a less busy day.  I  could just trash the wait staff and service based on that evening, but I realize it was busy,  obviously busier than anticipated,  and will be back to enjoy their offerings again."

I am not a steak person. But my husband is, so i decided to make him pleased and chose the steakhouse. The food was awful. My husband\u2019s steak was burnt. It was super oily and did not taste good at all. I ordered prosciutto mozzarella it was also bad. The sides were bad. Cocktails were disgusting. If you charge $16 for the cocktail- you have to make it right! The service was terrible. We put my husbands jacket at the chair next to us. Every time when the server was near our table he leaned on the chair and put both of his hands on the jacket!!!! It was every time! And he was at least 5 times near our table. We also ordered a draft beer and got it in the bottle. We won\u2019t come back for sure and never suggest it to anyone.",

The only one that wasn't to my par was the lobster mac and cheese but everything else was fantastic. The bill was $530 for 3 but we splurged and we'll do it again get reservations and enjoy a fine restaurant. Our waiter was David and he did a fantastic job as well.

   "Great for lunch in that they have happy hour menu. Between three of us we ordered fish tacos, burger and French dip. We all very much enjoyed the food, with the onion rings being fantastic, but French fries were just so so.  One issues may be parking, but there is a garage across the street, otherwise there are meters along the front and side, but they may be taken up or restricted based on events.  I'll be returning for dinner to see how the main dishes are, and I have a feeling they will be quite good. I recommend this spot.",
   "This site is my favorite site.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. Whenever  I want to go to a delicious dinner, this restaurant comes first to my mind. splendid and diverse  food and a large menu.courteous team, and agreeable vibes. Also important, the price is modest. I praise this restaurant with great pleasure.",

   "This place is located on the corner of 4th and L Street. They have a really friendly atmosphere and the bar is separate from the tables. It is handicap friendly. I joined some friends for Dine in Sacramento. The food is outstanding. I chose the spicy green beans, braised short ribs and the chocolate brownie pie. I was not disappointed. I even took home a doggie bag. Try the brussel sprouts with bacon."

   "Such a little gem right in J St.. great organic food, lots of vegan options, amazing smoothies and I can wait to come back for the broth bowls.\n\nSuch a cozy environment, ultra local vibe, healthy delicious food all the way. They even have a cool book, game and coloring section.\n\nThey take cash and cards so no worries there. \n\nGreat salads and even the burger was delicious. Can\u2019t wait to come back.",
   "Yet another great cafe that has a solid selection of vegan options in the Sacramento area. I went with the Vegan BLAT and a side of fries. It was a very flavorful mushroom cap and sauces weren\u2019t too overpowering. Also, the fries were really good. IMO not all places have fries that genuinely hit the spot. \n\nThe location feels a little tucked away but quaint when you get inside. The decor is fun and very mushroom forward. I loved that they had cards on the tables describing different mushrooms and where to find them.",
   "Wow. Who knew? Tucked on the corner I would have never ever have found this place if it wasn't for local guides here.  A group of us gals had a good sampling of their delicious fries and portobello mushroom burger. It was probably one of best organic healthy food restaurants in downtown Sacramento.",
   "This place was a surprise and a great one. The staff were super kind and friendly. The food was amazing and the place has such amazing decor. Its a wonderful place to catch up with friends and coffee/lunch break, a date time or even has a quick bite to eat. Definitely will be coming back here.",
   "Nice little cafe. Enjoyed the power bowl and the Golden milk was as really good, first time trying it iced (cashier\u2019s suggestion, thank you!). Very cozy spot, I look forward to my next visit."
