   "This is a really nice park. Kids will really like the climbing area. Parking can be difficult at times. One tip is to park on the other side of the river and walk across Junction Bridge. Not only is it free parking, but more than likely you might have visited the bridge anyway during your visit. The bridge leads right into the heart of the park for easy access.",
   "The care that has went onto this park is amazing. Every where one looks you can find the most amazing art. Around every corner is a new discovery. There are two pedestrian bridges that link the the North Little Rock and Little Rock sides of the Arkansas River.\n\nBe sure to walk towards the Clinton Presidential Center and find the great wetlands bridge and educational walk.",
   "An amazing park with a lovely playground as well as a nice historical walk. Has many different historical attractions integrated within the walking path as well as having many different statues. I've came here many times in the afternoon as well as 1 or 2am in the morning. I've never had issues with bad people here nor any feeling of danger.  Great place for kids and family",
   "Beautiful park that overlooks the Arkansas river. Also has a good look at the U.S.S. Razorback a submarine that served in World War 2. Got a little crowded during the evening.",
   "This is a great spot to visit for some history of Little Rock as you walk along the river. You also have the opportunity to stop by the local shops and eateries just a short distance away from the park. This is a great area to take pictures. The family will enjoy the walk and there is a park gym that the children can play on When it is warm to hot outside there is a splash fountain or park that the kids can play in and run through. This is centrally located from several hotels and restaurants nearby and other local attractions. The Museum of Discovery is nearby for the family as well."

   "It\u2019s a cool bridge so you can\u2019t expect much ,but it\u2019s a unique experience for people driving by. On the side where Burns Park is its very friendly for bikes on the side. Especially since there is many good views to look at. In the middle of the bridge is a big water stream. It\u2019s nice seeing the massive amounts of water go down the bridge. On the other side of the bridge is not as bike friendly for it is fairly steep ,but if you really wanted to you could go ahead and go.",
   "Absolutely mind blowing how big the bridge is! Quite a modern marvel to visit! I always enjoy taking in the view from the center of the bridge. Definitely a place of interest for tourists, especially if you've never seen a river this large. I know the Mississippi River is bigger, but Arkansas River is still quite a sight to see. Arkansas is such a beautiful state!",
   "I love love love walking across this bridge.. It's our go-to place for an afternoon walk.  On hot summer days it's nice and breezy!  Have had some real jerks on bicycles speed past with no warning which is no fun..",
   "My favorite place for outdoor fun or a nice run. It is a central point of the Arkansas River Trail. The east view at sunrise over the Arkansas River is beautiful and equally matched with the west view which includes Pinnacle Mountain. It is well lit in the evening and there are benches at the top to just sit an enjoy. The distance across is almost 1 mile.",
   "Great place to walk and get the heart rate up. Too bad people don't pick up after their dogs or it would get five stars."

   "This museum highlights great work in the continuous struggle for freedom and equality in our shared American Experiment.\n\nThe exhibits can we enjoyed from anywhere to 30 minutes to up to 2 hours. \n\nAlso there are several book titles available in the gift shop as well as National Park passports, stamps, t-shirts, postcards, etc.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and helpful. They're also clean restrooms which are easily accessible by the physically disabled.\n\nJust across corner to the visitor center is Central High School which is still a functioning for year senior high school. If you wish to go on a tour it is an necessary to call ahead and or go online to sign up for the tours which are only available twice a day.\n\nAcross the street you can see the fully restored filling station which offered the public telephone which the media used at the time.\n\n I'm so grateful to the National Park Service for this facility which offers education and reflection on difficult and painful journey our fellow Americans have beared and the good we have all benefited from despite powerful forces that desire to keep us mired in hatred, divided and suffering.\n\nSee you on the road,\n\ud83d\udcf8 \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f@gabrielcraft.me",

Very educational spot with lots of small historical items. The gift shop has cute items for kids and adults at reasonable prices.",

It is so neat!!",

The Museum has some old fashion flair and could use more interactive features like holograms life of old presidents or just Arkansas in general..The best part this place is free to enjoy on a nice day when you walking the Downtown area I definitely recommend this place as a hidden gem.",
   "Informative, and interesting. They could make It a little more fun, more personality with staff would be good. I enjoyed it, especially the gowns, and hand made blankets.",
   "The grounds were beautiful and had a couple of exhibits. The museum itself was free if I'm not mistaken and we wandered through the whole place. Arkansas has spent a considerable amount of money on this building and I highly recommend that you visit if you're in this area. There is a lot to do in this immediate part of town but it only took us about 20 minutes.",
   "Thought was the state museum.. just hx old state house. Some artifacts mainly boards with pix..  skippable unless a political fan.. could be great... wish more like PA state museum. In cool area off the trolley line.. love the trolly.. close to the water.. really nice staff..",
   "It isn't action movies, but it is history! Marvel at the elegant architecture and beautiful furnishings, and then lose yourself in the extraordinary heritage of early Arkansas and the people who shaped the future!"

   "You will always learn something on the tours of the older construction, and the attached museum has incredible exhibits and connections rotating through.  A true gem.",
   "This is actually a great museum. It\u2019s got two sections. The first is an 1800\u2019s village that you can take guided tours of for a small fee ($1.50), complete with a print shop, pub and some other cabins and houses. The second section is the main museum itself (free), with tons of exhibits, ranging from artifacts from the daily life of early Arkansans, Native American artifacts, Civil War artifacts, early exploration artifacts, and more. Definitely a good stop when you\u2019re in historic downtown.",
   "Absolutely loved this museum! It's free to tour the gallery and they have guided tours for a small fee. The gift shop has lots of interesting little items. I picked up a very tiny mason jar of honey and a bat magnet. The artwork and artifacts here are pretty tame so its a good place for kids. I highly recommend checking it out.",

This is one of the oldest buildings in Little Rock and is the site of many important Arkansas events, such as the start of the Civil War in the state, as well as the birth of General Douglas MacArthur. It\u2019s got some decent exhibits on all manner of wars where Arkansas citizens are involved, as well as some on the acclaimed general and the suffragettes. Best of all, it\u2019s free admission. Might as well go if you\u2019re in the area.",

   "It's a little hard to see from the street, so in this case watch carefully. Parking is somewhat limited, but that's pretty much everywhere in downtown Little Rock. We took a self-guided tour. If you aren't familiar with the plants, I suggest you use an app like Picture This or Bixby Vision to help identify the plant. If you're hungry the River Market is nearby, as is Community Bakery. Sometimes you can also find a food truck on or near the premises. On to the garden itself. I found it well maintained and quite peaceful for a downtown garden. It is not as big as I expected but if you have children or elderly family members with you, that could be a plus. It was a cold fall day when I went. I would love to visit the garden again in the spring! There are a few homeless people around, so just be aware of your surroundings and choose an appropriate time for your visit.",

   "Even though I didn't care for him or his wife, this is a really nice museum with lots of photos and history. It's a rip-off to get a photo at the (reproduction) resolute desk in the Oval Office. If you want a photo it's $15.00! ridiculous. Since this is supposed to be history.....how about something along the lines of Monica.....that was a big piece of history that was conveniently forgotten to be added.",
   "Every time I visit. I see something new. Great place to get some great history on the 32nd president and the first look into the bridge to the 21st century.",
   "Food in the restaurant was good, and the grounds on the river were beautiful in the fall, however the museum itself was a snoozer.  Very boring.  It needs to be updated with some interactive displays or something interesting besides letters from celebrities.  The Foundation room was closed.  Didn't take long to go through it.",
   "We had such a fun time visiting here today.  We were especially excited to see the 90s exhibit that is currently here.",
   "Modern architecture. Endless information. Great exhibits that are always changing. The presidential library is a must see."

There is 3 floors of fun like a bed of nails, a robot Spirograph, and a room with a presentation what it\u2019s like to be in a tornado. The museum is especially fun with kids because they get to experience new things. They have so many things you can\u2019t do them all. An overview of The Museum of Discovery is that if your near the museum I definitely recommend going the here. It\u2019s a very fun experience.",
   "Wonderful place. In homeschooling my 6 year old and this is one of those places I look for in every city to give her ideas and inspiration to discover how modern technology works. We really our day as a family discovering new things.",
   "Great for kids. Especially younger ones. Only a few displays get updated though so you can't go regularly. I am sure this comes down to funding and they do what they can do if you have the money to make a large donation I recommend doing it to benefit the kids interested in science.",
   "Really fun. My girlfriend and I are 30 and we had fun for an hour and a half checking everything out. This would be a great place to take kids for a few hours to learn about science in a fun way. Just a heads up, the tornado simulator is fairly loud."

   "I love nature/outdoorsy activities but the bugs hate me.  My first time was in 2005 through the east summit trail, tougher hike. I accidentally kicked a wasp's nest and got stung on each leg.  The east summit has bigger rocks and can get quite steep-- getting on all fours would be recommended. We took the west summit trial this time (1.5 miles total).  There were bumblebees swarming everywhere, but didn't get bit (thank goodness).  Unfortunately, I went after a  night of drinking and so it took us over an hour just to reach the top (due to multiple breaks) and only 30 minutes going back down. I thought the hike down would be scary due to some steep inclines, but it was fairly quick and easy. There are small loose rocks than can make you slide and sprain an ankle so look where you are stepping. I slid, but thank goodness it was a light fall.   It's best to pay attention to the yellow painted rocks/trees and it guides you where to go and probably the easiest way to hike.  Luckily my friend knew to stick to the left coming up as it is the easier, less steep hike.  The trails are laid out with rocks to step on (some may be slippery due to some sand), but for the most part, the path is clear-cut.  There is an area where you hike up nothing but big rocks (that was the fun part for me). It can get dangerous.  I somehow ended up bleeding from a large scratch, but I was probably too tired to feel a scratch on my leg. I didn't notice this until after the hike was completed.\n\nThe hike, overall, was pretty much shaded thanks to the trees, but unfortunately the summit is not.  Once you reach the top you're fairly tired and want to rest, but if you go on a 100-degree day like we did you cannot sit up there and enjoy the view for long. I ran out of Gatorade by then. The view is worth it!   I enjoyed it and would like to hike it again in the fall.  Pack plenty of water!",
   "A nice quiet place to relax, hike, fish, boat, and just be...chill. Plus the roads are great! It looks amazing! Go see the view from the top of the lookout!",
   "Great spot to get outdoors without having to drive too far out of the city. I like going on weeknights to avoid the crowds. The East Quarry trail is my favorite!",
   "I love this place. Lots to do in the park. The climb is not too difficult; beautiful views from the top. It's just a steep uphill walk with no climbing skills needed.",
   "Climbing Pinnacle is an experience that every able Central Arkansan should try at least once.  There is a reason you see so many selfies from the top--it's truly gorgeous."

   "Fantastic zoo! Great staff and beautiful animals! This park is easy to navigate. There is a great restaurant to eat lunch and cool off! Very kid friendly with a little kid zone, which contains slides and other play equipment. There is a train that runs through the zoo as well. The animals are close enough to see easily and take great pictures!",

   "The zoo is awesome and seems to always be renovating to make life for the animals the best as possible. One interesting thing about the Little Rock Zoo is that a lot of the animals they have are geriatric and the staff takes awesome care of them. The staff is also great about educating guests on the various animals located at the zoo and answering any questions you may have.",
   "What a Great time at the Zoo.\nPerfect weather on a Sunday afternoon. $12.95\u00d72 Adults was very affordable. Scenic train on a random schedule due to overheating issues. Soda machines everywhere. Bring quarters to feed the Koi Fish.\nMe and a good friend walked around for hours. Hadn't been to a zoo in 25 YEARS. \nBring your own lunch, the cafe was out of Coke & French Fries..gift shop is small, but not over priced.\n$3/ Person for Mini-Train ride..\nGreat Job to the whole staff working..we shall return for a membership now.."

   "Great place!! Fun, wide open and tons of room to jump and play! Friendly, awesome staff! Much more affordable than other so called trampoline parks. This one actually has TONS of trampolines plus lots of other stuff! Kids loved it!!",
   "This is an awesome place. Everyone loves it. No more specials or discounts. It was empty when we went. Had the whole place to ourselves.",
   "First of all the kids love it. They had me drive to Little Rock from our hometown of Searcy rather than going to Conway. I understand that Conway has a similar trampoline park. This particular trampoline park is huge. It has dozens and dozens of trampolines and activities associated with trampolines. There are virtual reality games, basketball goals video games, etc... there are a lot of family size picnic tables that you can set it to have your pizza, nachos, chips and candy that you can get at the snack bar at pretty reasonable prices actually. They have bottled drinks and believe it or not the bathrooms are pretty clean. You would think with hundreds of kids coming to this place daily bit by this time a day which is around 7 PM and our close on Sunday, that the bathrooms might be disgusting. Well anything but disgusting they actually smelled nice and are very clean. Sure you\u2019re going to see a little paper laying around here and there but the men\u2019s bathroom is actually clean.  The price was basically $20 for two hours per kid. Plus there\u2019s a new added bonus of that you must buy a pair of their traction socks or grip socks and an additional two dollars per kid. This is a little different than most trampoline parks. Most trampoline parks will let you use the socks you bring The price was basically $20 for two hours per kid. Plus there\u2019s a new added bonus of that you must buy a pair of their traction socks or grip socks and an additional two dollars per kid. This is a little different than most trampoline parks. Most trampoline parks what do you use the socks you bring., Then The grip socks at two dollars each are optional. Not crazy about that , But I understand you need to create various streams of revenue to operate a business. It\u2019s set me back eight dollars plus tax so not too bad I guess. One thing I do like about this trampoline park over the other ones I\u2019ve been to is I can actually hear myself make this review while using voice text. There is music but it\u2019s not so loud that I can feel it in my teeth. Don\u2019t get me wrong I like music but they figured out a good balance for us parents who want to watch videos or TV on the phone while we wait for the kids.  I understand they have party discounts as well or group discounts. I\u2019m not sure about the pricing on that but I know if you give them a call or check their website you could most likely find out easily. If you\u2019re in the little rocky are you or what we are 50 miles away and decide you want to try a trampoline park give Altitude a shot I think you\u2019ll be happy. And I know the kids will be.....",
   "No rules enforced and big kids were running full speed and tackling each other. Plowing into the little ones, pushing them out of the way. My kid got plowed and didn\u2019t want to go back in the trampolines by herself. No employees anywhere to control unsafe behavior. Someone threw a crushed water bottle on a trampoline and it was there until I picked it up. The bathroom was beyond disgusting. It could be a great place if their own supposed \u201crules\u201d were enforced and the bathroom was sanitary. The trampolines are fun.",
   "My boys love coming here. Staff is friendly and helpful. Always clean! My boys have a blast everytime we come. Love the socks \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude01 and the boys think its awesome they get to take them home. I do wish there was different music played more kid friendly.. like 93.3 the fish. Or klove so its all positive and not promoting sex and  worldly activities  that would be my only request.  We need more Jesus in this world . Especially for our children. Amen."

Pictures of people obviously making their life uncomfortable.  Hopefully those people realized their error later in life. The barred kids acted courteously and refused to meet hate with hate. Non-violence worked for them. Those kids and parents were BRAVE.",

The hotel also has a shuttle if you prefer not to walk. The warm cookies they offer at check-in are wonderful. We stayed in a king room with a city view. The bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked well. I like a cool room and I was able to keep it that way. The bathroom looked like it had been updated. There is no longer a tub, but a walk in shower instead, with tiling all around. Parking would be the only negative for this hotel. There is a large underground parking lot attached, but I had to circle several times to find a spot. Then it was quite a walk to the hotel entrance. They will validate your card, though, so at least it is free. All the staff was very friendly and helpful.",

   "Beautiful place to take pictures. We will definitely be back when its warmer to get more pics taken.",
   "Absolute beauty. Well kept. March 9 ...flowers, wildlife and bayou.",
   "The old Mill, great place to visit and relax. The mill was featured in Gone with the wind,  just got a major upgrade to make the waterwheel work again, the path has a couple of bridges(made to resemble wood) to the mill itself, which has 2 levels, the stairs are on the inside. A couple of fountains have been added. The mill area is also part of a bigger lake, which has recently been drained and cleaned out and had renovation work adding some docks for the locals who live across the street.",
   "We were disappointed in the Riverwalk Market area. It is great if you want food or drinks but shopping was VERY limited. The streetcar was nice. Showed locations of all the museums and it is free! All of the little parks are worth a visit. You probably won't need to pay for more than 3 hours parking though."

   "My son always enjoys Funland. When went to Funland holiday express party to see Santa. The Santa they had was very nice and looked the part. The only problem I ever have with Funland is that they don't have enough employees so you have to wait for them to walk over to the other rides.",
   "Place is pretty cool, always kept clean and is under new management. The new manager, Betty, is great. They have your family's best interest at heart. They recently just had the concession stand painted and are doing some work to the exterior. A lot of time and effort is being spent on the place. The city always keeps the park cleaned and mowed/leaves mulched, and its regularly patrolled by NLR police or even a state trooper from time to time. Not at all sketchy like it use to be. Funland kinda has that \"festival\" vibe. It's a welcoming place, so long as you come with your child, and you're not 30 trying to ride the attractions. There's even a dog park, one for large breeds and another for small breeds!",
   "Oh my goodness what a great time we had today!! Poppa and Gammy sure enjoyed watching our sweet grandkiddo's having so much fun riding the Funland rides, (made for just their size) if you've not been with your grandkids or kids you should go! A $10 wrist band gives the kids unlimited all day rides!! That's an awesome deal... \ud83d\ude0a all the staff is so kind and ready to help where needed.. Thank you!!!",
   "To begin with, the staff provided excellent customer service. They are extremely understaffed. There are about 13-15 rides, but only 3 people running around to attending the rides. You pay $150 for 10 kids attending party. Get 10 wristbands for unlimited rides for 2 hours. Well we didn't get to ride but 3.  If it is staffed appropriately, it would easily be 5 stars. I'll try again in the future.",
   "Clean and safe park for kids of all ages."

   "One of my favorites just because of how many treasures I find. Plenty parking on off hours. I\u2019ve gone at less busy times, so I don\u2019t ever have a problem. Playground. Ball field. Pavilions with grills. Upper parking or unloading for pavilions only open at certain hours. Lovely creek with a cute little bridge. Dog poop bag dispensers with bags. Nice for a little walk or exploring through the woods. Heavy on mosquitoes at night and in the woods trail area. Trails link together and lead into neighborhoods. Honeysuckles make the place smell so wonderful when it blooms everywhere!",
   "This is so awesome!  I've never seen a FREE \"bike repair station\"  like this before and it's genius!  All the tools are easy to get to but also are locked/chained to the station to prevent theft.   I have been seeing this for a couple weeks now but never would have guessed it was this!   Like I said before GENIUS!   \"Gateway at Allsopp Park North\" I believe it's called, but whatever it's really cool!",
   "This place is a little treasure.  Nice trails.  Woodland.  And there's a little ensemble that regularly plays at noon.  Delightful to wander around with a musical background.  Get out in some nature and unwind.",
   "My youngest daughter (19 months old) loved the creek that looks man-made. She seemed to really mellow out and enjoy the sun and the crystal clear water that was gently rolling  past the rocks that broke the surface of the stream from underneath. Shes usually a ball of energy and this place really seemed to soothe her.",
   "There\u2019s so much to do! There\u2019s a small loop that\u2019s paved that goes around the activity area, a larger \u201cSouth\u201d loop that\u2019s about 1.3 miles that takes you on a forest walk and a \u201cNorth\u201d loop that you have to cross a street to get to but is more secluded. Zoom into Google maps just close enough and it\u2019ll show you the walk paths. The loops start in the south west culdesack of the south west parking lot. \nBaseball diamonds, playground equipment, art, covered areas, and even a tennis court. Time here is automatically well spent just showing up."

   "A must see for anyone who is interested in the history of this country and Native Americans. This is a very important part of this country's past and should be seen by everyone. We need to do everything we can to preserve places like this before modern \"progress\" has destroyed all of these sacred sites to build cookie cutter subdivisions or mass production businesses.",
   "A very beautiful place to go with family! Also, A good place to learn more about our beautiful state Arkansas!!\n\nFact:\n- Did you know the reason our state is called Arkansas is because the french called the Qua paws Arkansans (meaning down stream people)",
   "We enjoyed our visit here.  Super peaceful reflection on our history and lots of information in the museum.  Easy walking path around the mounds and along the pond.  We stayed on the paved path though could probably easily have done the other longer path with the stroller.   Really neat FREE experience!",
   "Very nice park. Trails are easy to walk. The boardwalk area over the oxbow lake and next to the Cypress trees is especially nice. Visitor Center is very informative. Nice video. Very nice Park Ranger.",
   "Wow! It has been years, when I was a kid, since I have been here. But this place is great. What little impression I had when I was a kid was blown out of the water by what we experienced today, we took the family of four, which included a five and a three-year-old out and we had a great time! We did half of the longer Trail before we had to get back to the visitor center to take the tram ride. The trail is nice, but where your Sun tan lotion and bug spray. The tram ride was a fun experience and the breeze from it was welcomed. Park interpreter Amy was amazing, great with the kids and very personable. Can't wait to get out here for a equinox or solstice program."

Finding the Museum itself can be a little tricky too, but google maps should be able to point you in the right direction. Drive safely through the base and respectfully, you don't want problems with local enforcement. Remember, you're on the grounds of a military base.\nThe museum itself is quite fascinating. They have all sorts of vehicles outside for you to observe and even touch (no climbing allowed, i don't suggest testing out your luck and climbing a tank in a military base... just saying). There's also an inside part of the museum which is just as fascinating as the outside.",

I haven't been to very many of the other features of the park but I look forward to my next visit.  Great camping,  fishing,  hiking,  and just all around enjoyment of the beautiful surroundings.  Enjoy!!",
   "Great hikes and activities available. We stayed in the yurts which were comfortable.  The walk to the showers and restrooms was not too far. The hike to the falls was a little steep in places but even our youngest hiker made it with no problem. The children have a nice time in the water from the falls. Canoes were a nice activity for those that chose to venture out. Biking around the area was also a big hit with the kids.",
   "A MUST do if you are in the area! This is definitely one of the more busy parks, but for good reason. Once you get past the steeper part of the start of the trail, it is a fairly fast and flat walk to the waterfall. The restaurant and lodge are comfy, cozy, and have guest that are hard to beat! The restaurant has a fairly large menu that is absolutely fairly priced. The drive alone to get to the park is great! Must see!",
   "A great spot not too far off the main way through the state if you're traveling through the area. I'm glad we found this park because I love waterfalls, and we happened to visit in the middle of February when they were flowing quite well from all the recent rain.\n\nThe Cedar Falls trail is pretty short and leads up to a great waterfall, but it's the most popular hike in the park so if you're wanting to avoid a lot of people go earlier or later in the day. If you have time, the Seven Hollows trail was nice, too. It also had fewer people on it, probably because of its length. The 4.5 mile trail is a fairly easy one, but bring water.",
   "Absolutely INCREDIBLE state park. The best I\u2019ve gone to. So much to do as it is such an enormous park. Hours and hours of trails to hike, including one that is 12 miles which I hope to get geared up for soon! If you\u2019re near the area going hiking here is a MUST! Do not miss out! Even if you\u2019re out of state looking for an amazing place to hike, GO HERE!!!"

   "Laurel Park is a great place to spend an afternoon! In the summer, the attached splash pad is a nice way to cool off, and a playground to warm back up. The grounds are kept clean, with trash cans readily available, Picnic tables for lunch, and pavilions to keep out of the sun. The trees offer a lot of natural shade a well, that other parks don't have. Beyond the splash pad and park there is a large level field to picnic in, play kick ball, Frisbee, fly kites, or just a walk on the trail provided! Great area!",

   "This is my son's favorite park in the Conway area! There's lots of space for kids to run, a tiny slide for the littles, 4 buckle-up swings, 4 big kid swings, 3 big kid slides, plenty of stuff to climb on, and a free splash pad (like a water park without the slides) to play on during the summer! There's also well maintenanced bathrooms! (There's a men's,  women's and family bathroom, but they're usually locked on Sundays.) There's plenty of benches surrounding the park and lots of shaded area! \nLaurel Park is also super close to Patti Cakes, where you can take the kids to get a well deserved treat after playing nice with the other kids! And Patti Cakes is literally right next to Stobys, where you could take the kids for a filling lunch before getting a treat at Patti Cakes!"

   "This was such a nice relaxing place to be! The water was so warm, perfect bathwater temperature. While sitting next to this spring, you can almost forget that this is located right in town. There are a lot of nice walking trails in the park.  It is also nice to fill up a jug of water at one of the drinking water stations. There are at least two that we saw. It is nice to see the area from the nearby tower as well as go to all the nice shops, restaurants and hotels nearby. The one thing I was hoping to see more of was the natural springs other than the one pictured. We didn't  walk every path, so we could have missed something. I am sure most of the  springs are harvested to use in the nearby bath houses. Overall, it is very nice place to see  and worth a visit.",
   "Insanely gorgeous area! The history is enough to warrant a visit. The fact they still have operating bath houses is even more impressive and is a cherry on top. Beautiful natural sites and the amazing geological marvel of the springs are a sight to behold. Without a doubt make your way to this amazing time of a place.",
   "As far as a place to visit, it's alright. Learning the history of the area is kind of interesting, and visiting one of the bath houses for a spa is, once again, an interesting experience. But as far as National Parks go, this is an odd one. Since it had the label \"National Park\" I really expected something different, more nature. I would think of this more as a National Monument or something along those lines. I think that would have set up my expectations better.",
   "I really loved spending time in Hot Springs. I really enjoyed the history of the bathhouses. We stayed at the Waters which was a great place. We walked around and had a private soak and a couples massage, which we really enjoyed. We were there for 2 days so we didn't get to explore as much as I would have wanted to. It was cold in December, so I would like to come back in the summer and check out the lakes.",
   "The only national park I've ever seen that's center is also a town center. Also had walking trails where u could get off the sidewalks and onto the dirt for less traveled, crowded areas. Free access to fill your own containers from both cold and hot springs which was very cool."

Makes any trip to the region more than worth it. I know I'll take every opportunity to come back and see this beautiful place again.",

   "This place was fantastic but it\u2019s so weird to get there.  Would be a lovely spot in the summer time since there is an outdoor patio. Not featuring the steak sandwich but that was my favorite thing.  This place is absolutely worth locating even if it feels rather obscure.",
   "Disappointing to be honest. Maybe my expectations were too high based on the good reviews I heard from some people. Service was very good though, attentive but not loitering around. Cool location near the river, probably great view when its warm. Went for dinner on Friday. We shared the wild mushroom tart for an appetizer; filling was great, crust was burnt and bitter. For mains we had the walleye ($37) and the duck with duck ($32). Each main came with a salad that was pretty basic, not bad but just a filler. The mains also came with identical sides of red cabbage, new potatoes, and patty-pan squash. The sides were just kinda tossed on the plate, squash was undercooked and flavorless, potatoes and cabbage just more filler. The fish was cooked well, saffron sauce was good. Duck was cooked medium and was flavorful, but the skin was not crispy. The sausage was a little sweet but alright. Wine prices were reasonable, but at $30+ for entrees I just dont think its worth the money.",
   "This fantastic find is hidden away in an office building setting on the 1st floor.... above G floor.  As we got close, the signs and smells directed us the rest of the way.  A quaint, clean, and inviting setting overlooks the Arkansas River and pleases from the start.  The shrimp, avocado, and grapefruit appetizer was unique and very well presented and fantastic.  I had the walleye and it was superb, and another had the Reuben sandwich that was huge and unbelievably tasty.  I\u2019ll be back sometime when I can set outside and overlook the river, eat endless appetizers at random, and have wine glass after wine glass.",
   "Love this place. Fine dining with an awesome view of the Arkansas River. Guaranteed that every single thing on your plate is meticulously prepared and nothing was put there by accident. I\u2019ve never had a dish or side that wasn\u2019t amazing. The owner Peter Brave is always there mingling with the customers as well checking on you seeing what you thought of the food. Very special place to me and my wife. We love it here. Highly recommend.",
   "Tucked away in Little Rock is a true hidden gem. Excellent service with friendly and welcoming staff! Delicious food with every bite.  Peter Brave personalizes the night by visiting every table and capturing your dining experience."

   "Great atmosphere in a small, quaint restaurant setting. Smaller seating areas that could get too full in peak times. The menu items are unique & fresh - the turkey sandwich & hamburger come in bread that is super fresh & looks even better. German cuisine is the spotlight - but the desserts are the hidden gems.",
   "Our goto where everyone knows you name spot. Great Northern European food. Wonderful cocktails and some of the friendliest wait staff you will run into and the bar tenders are even better",
   "Wonderful atmosphere. We dined on the patio. Great service. Our server was just the right amount of attentive, and explained all the dishes for us. And her recommendations where spot on. And the food, was a deligth. Every bite was amazing. We had the bacon wrapped date and the Deviled Eggs for appetizers. My daughter made a meal out of the smorgasbord tray. I had the Brat plate, and was happy as clam with it.  Had the Apple Strudel and the Crepes for desert to finish a great meal. They are lightly sweet and just a perfect compliment to all the different taste sensations of the meal.\nWe will be going again as we are wanting to try several other dishes. The house pate is great. They make most of what we ate in house and it just enhances the taste and over all meal experience.",
   "The atmosphere and the food here are out of this world! You feel as if you have been transported to Central Europe! Comfort food Plus a fabulous staff! Bonnie our server has the best recommendations, and always a pleasant smile! Love her!! This place never disappoints!",
   "What a great little gem! We had the Lasagna and it blew me away. We loved the environment as well. It was lively but quiet enough to have a nice conversation. The deserts were to die for!"

   "The food at this restaurant was so divine we had to go back for their brunch. Their shrimp risotto was incredibly creamy and so delicious. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the duck salad was amazing. The dining room looks like a French restaurant with their freshly pressed white tablecloths and the wait staff were all super nice and took great care of us. It's definitely a high-end restaurant and therefore not cheap but it was money well spent.",
   "Had an amazing \"anniversary dinner\" fantastic food and fabulous service. Well worth it!",
   "One of the city's best restaurants. 111 is a fine dining experience appropriate for any family, friends, or company dining event. From date night to dinner with out-of-town visitors no matter what time of day you'll find an exquisite menu offering the best ingredients in a most beautiful presentation. The breakfast is one of my favorite two locations in the city. The biscuits and gravy are excellent as well as the eggs benedict. For lunch, would recommend the Express Menu. Recommend making a reservation with the hotel concierge or online reservation system. Valet is available for the car even when not staying at the hotel.",
   "The best homemade biscuits. They are so fluffy and light",
   "Bottom Line: Excellent food and environment, but questionable service. \n\nThis was our first time to visit One Eleven. We are massive fans of the Capital Bar & Grill as well as the general vibe of the hotel. So, we have always wanted to try One Eleven, especially after hearing such great things about their brunch. \n\nWhen we arrived, it took us about 10 minutes to get the attention of the hostess. In her defense, she seemed to be addressing some sort of a situation. Once we were seated, it took our waitress a good bit to come by. While she was kind, she was generally inattentive. \n\nOur food, however, was excellent. The eggs Benedict and the Salmon eggs Benedict were both spot-on, truly some of the best we\u2019ve had. The coffee was also very good. \n\nIt was an overall good experience; it was just a bit disheartening to feel like an afterthought to the waitstaff. \n\nWe are going to give it another try at some point to see if the service improves."

   "The Root Cafe is a fun little restaurant serving a solid menu of comfort foods and one or more specialty dishes and salads.  They also have a few vegan and gluten-free items to choose from. When the weather is nice you can make use of their beautiful outside garden. I had one of their homemade brats which I found to be delicious. Overall I would come back.",
   "This is my new favorite place to eat.  The food is absolutely delicious, they have exciting combinations for your palate that linger in your mouth all day long. The energy and staff is so kind.  You feel good overall being there and when you leave. The best way to describe the experience is wholesome. Can't wait to come back!",
   "Saw this featured on Diner Drive-ins and Dives a couple years ago and it's been on my list since. Great menu and colorful, kitschy decor. The food was great and the service was quick. My only reason for 4 stars is some of the staff was not on their best behavior. They seemed to be mad at each other and it showed in their interactions. We found a table right next to the kitchen so it was obvious there was some friction there. But overall,  definitely worth a visit when in Little Rock. Its popular with locals and tourists and with good reason.",
   "Such a yummy place! Even if you aren\u2019t into the whole \u201cfarm fresh\u201d thing this place is a good stop! Our favorite drink we get every time we go is the blackberry lemonade... so good!! It\u2019s always busy when we go which I\u2019ve always noticed to been a sign that it\u2019s a good place. I\u2019ve had both breakfast and lunch here, both great!",
   "I've heard from many of my friends about this place for some time so I decided to by for breakfast.  They certainly take a different approach what many consider a traditional breakfast as there are some options that no other place around offers.  Honestly it's a bold move but that's definitely hit or miss.  I had the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon.  The biscuits and gravy were pretty good, slightly sweet but no complaints.  The bacon on the other hand.... I'll just say that I've had bacon bits that had more flavor.  Maybe it was just an off day but I think it was actually made ahead of time because it literally crumbled to the touch.  Even microwaved bacon would be ashamed to claim it as its relative.  But the service was very good!  Couldn't have asked for a nicer staff.  I'm not completely writing this place off but I had to be honest and my experience.  I'll go back again for a dinner service and will let you all know what I think of that."

   "Absolutely awesome. Beautiful small bar. Went twice within the week. Delicious food, outstanding service and great location downtown. Definitely compares to New York Italian. Owner came out of the kitchen to see how our meal was.  The ravioli is amazing. highly recommended",
   "Many people complain that Little Rock doesn\u2019t have good Italian in the area. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. I have lived in Manhattan and dined in the original Little Italy of the Bronx. Bruno\u2019s Little Italy is every bit the best of the best of Italian cuisine. My New Years\u2019 resolution is definitely to frequent Bruno\u2019s more often. Service was impeccable! We also had cannolis and spumoni ice cream, but ate them faster than I remembered to take a photo! So delicious! The ambiance of Bruno\u2019s is everything you want a homemade Italian cafe to be! Thank you!",
   "Came down from Springfield, Missouri area to try this restaurant out.  Heard nothing but good things and this place delivered!  Their bread even tastes phenomenal and I am not usually a big fan of just bread.  They have a homemade sausage on spaghetti that\u2019s to die for!  \n\nWe were down here on the first weekend when President Trump was considering the notion of banning domestic travel and this place was STILL busy!  Highly encourage you to get here early.  They have a bar across the street from them that has fun bar games if you come before they open up.  Well worth the wait!  Not to mention, the owners are amazing people and have quite the passion for making sure their customers are happy and satisfied!",
   "My wife and I went downtown Little Rock to eat at Bruno's Little Italy on a Friday night in July. It was around 6:30 pm.   They do have valet parking for those that can't find parking.  The place was packed in the inside but we were the first people in line for a table.  We choose outdoor patio seating.  The atmosphere in the inside reminds me of a bustling Italian restaurant you see on television.  People moving really fast to go get orders or to place orders.  People seated at their tables laughing and having a great time.  The authentic Italian smell of Pizza or tomato sauce fills the air.  We were promptly seated outside.  they do have Italian music playing on the inside and outside which gives it even more authenticity.  My wife ordered an appetizer tray that was full of prosciutto, pepperoncini peppers, olives, many different cheeses, and sun-dried tomatoes.  I opted for the chicken cacciatore.  It did take a little to get the food probably around 30 to 40 minutes but it was well worth the wait.  I highly recommend this as a place to be with family and friends and eat really good Italian food we will be back.",
   "This is a must do if you're in little rock, Vince is as humble as they come, it was a pleasure eating here, I'm thankful for triple D for putting it on the map.  The heritage, old world Italian manners and great food.  I'll be back says most people that eat here, me included.  Get there early, they open at 5 and all tables were full by 6.  Oh yeah, if you eat nothing else...you gotta have the toasted ravioli...it's outta sight!"

   "Well my wife suggested that we go to this spot I was not that interested because I had a taste for a burger. I am glad that I decided to just go with her suggestions. (Who knew listening to wife was a winner)\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in the establishment a calming vibe came across of me. Now I  have had gyros before. (Who hasn't?) This place did not only made me realize that I had very cheap copies to the point I will be forever unable to accept the lesser versions. \n\nI also realized that the American policy that salt is a  season is unfounded and leads us to miss out on actual seasoning. The Rosemary Pasta (or the Olive Garden slayer) had so much taste I wondered if I can just buy the sauce. We all have experience bland chicken that was not cooked with the pasta and is void of seasoning throughout it. This was not the case. The chicken had to be infused and had become one with the flavors of the dish that I wanted to go hug the cook. \n\nI thought that I had pasta and a calzone before but I was misled in accepting D class pasta as A class. \n\nIf you want to eat at Olive garden again do not come here your taste buds will not accept second rate food again.",
   "Wonderful food!  The pita was soft and warm.  The humus was delicious!  The gyro was huge and exceptionally good. The chicken plate was a cacophony of flavor.  Rice on the bottom, grilled squash next, then topped with seasoned pieces of chicken.  Will definitely go back.",
   "I absolutely love Layla's! It's one of the places I miss most since we moved from the area. Their Greek style pizza is delicious and always has that perfect crust.  The Greek salad with chicken is also great. It's perfectly seasoned and has a generous portion. The prices are incredibly reasonable, especially considering the portions.",
   "One of my favorite places to eat. Each time I have gone I\u2019ve always had a good experience and the food is always delicious. \n\nI suggest getting one of their quality calzones: I highly recommend either the triple meat, artichoke or Greek calzone with gyro meat!",
   "Layla's is GREAT!!! The lamb is AWESOME!! It's some of the best meat I've ever tasted. It had me singing, \"Now behold the lamb, the precious lamb of Layla's.\" Nice atmosphere. Good service. Definitely one of my go to spots now."

   "The food was excellent. We shared the porterhouse. It was cooked to perfection. When you split You get a choice of four sides, just a heads up. The service was great. They had TV scattered in certain areas so a great place to go to kill time and watch a game or if you want a nice quiet dinner, they have areas for that too. Great experience.

   "Rainy, cold day out. Flipped the collar of my jacket up and hunched my shoulders from the parking lot just across the street. Entered through a heavy wooden door into a welcoming, open space with great decorations. It was a quiet afternoon with nothing but the sound of the rain outside and my fellow diners to accompany my meal, which I absolutely ate up. Speaking of, the bowl of roasted chicken and dumpling soup I ordered hit the spot, punctuated with readily-available hot sauce, and complimented by a tall glass of freshly-brewed sweet tea. Baskets of crackers offered some additional texture when desired. The waitress was pleasant and professional.\n\nOverall, a good, cheap, wholesome meal that left me with a full belly and a warm fuzzy feeling as I ventured back out into the elements to continue my day. Only time I've been there so far, but based on my experience I can't recommend it highly enough. Definitely check them out.",

Both were simple but done well. Good place to stop in if you're downtown.",
   "Wow, the Capital Hotel in downtown Little Rock was a great place to celebrate my wife's accomplishments!\nFood totally awesome, atmosphere welcoming with reasonable pricing! \nIt was a very special day for us and guess who we met there to make it even more special!"

   "This my absolute favorite taco place.  I am a lover of all things tacos and I will never go to Little Rock and not eat here.  The photos included in this review are just a couple of the MANY times that I have eaten here.  Perfectly priced and WONDERFULLY made and perfectly tasty!  So many flavors that are unique and beautifully paired ingredients.  Drinks have always been top notch and just typing this review makes my mouth water.  I\u2019m ready for more tacos.",
   "New favorite fresh Mexican restaurant in Little Rock.  Parking was tight but once inside you will forget all about that.  Service was great and very helpful.  Fist time visiting and they answered all our menu questions.  The chips and salsa are great with amazing queso so start with that.  Tried 3 dishes and loved each of them. Everything was cooked to order and I was surprised at the end by all the desert options.  Unfortunately I didn\u2019t save room so I\u2019ll just have to go back.  Very fresh and tasty you won\u2019t be disappointed.",
   "Had the 3 taco plate (shrimp, pork and bison), which came with diverse toppings. But the mini crab tacos were ridiculously good!!! Crab meat was so fresh and tasty, including the little salad that comes with it! Can really tell they care about quality here. Easily the best tacos I've had in Little Rock!!  For dessert had the tres leches cake - can't remember the last time I had a cake even comparable in taste and texture. Easily five stars.",
   "I went to the Fold: Botanas & Bar for dinner with some friends after visiting Little Rock Central High School. There was no wait time around 3pm on a Sunday. We ordered the shareable chips and four type dipping sauces\u2014red salsa, green salsa, cheese, guacamole. The chips are delicious and the cheese dipping sauce was the best one out of the four. For the main course, I ordered the 3 taco plate with an additional taco. I ordered two fish tacos, a chicken taco and a beef taco with a side of rice. The food was served in a timely manner. However, the taco meat was not very well seasoned. With a little bit more seasoning, the tacos would be great. The chips and dip was the best part about the meal. I would return to this restaurant just for the chips and dip. The restaurant decor is super cute and it is a relaxing environment. Also, there is an outside patio area that is dog friendly.",
   "Overall good experience got the green salsa appetizer. Ordered Crab sandwich and the three taco plate bison,pork, shrimp. Three of us shared are orders    the meal was good..."

   "Farm to table at its best.  Located inside the Burgundy Boutique hotel its a must try.  Parking is decent but don\u2019t let that hold you back.  Reservations are welcome but not necessary.  The waitstaff is excellent and they are great at walking you through the menu.  Everything is fresh and they have new items added regularly.  Portions were good size and the flavors of every dish were mind blowing amazing.  My tastebuds were popping out of my brain with delight.",
   "Fantastic! I didn't know what to expect and the place was just great. The waitress was awesome, her recommendations were spot on! The octopus was so tender and delicious, so flavorful! They have oyster tacos, oddly enough, and delicious \ud83d\ude0b!\nI had the sort rib for the main course and it was very tender and just perfect.\nOthers had the chicken and donuts (raves), the red snapper also great and a few other dishes.\nCan't say enough, definitely go there!",
   "I have had a few trips to Table 28 over the last few years. This was the first time we were seated inside, and it really changed the experience. Server was prompt. Drinks were refreshed frequently, and the food was excellent. We shared two of the fish mains, and both were amazing. Chef came out to say hi after the meal.",
   "This was our third meal, and like the previous, was excellent. The flavors are amazing, everything is well prepared, and the plating is spot on.\n\nWhat we didn't care for was the new (to us) dining lay out. In the past, the seating was more intimate, almost romantic. Now, it comes across as a hotel restaurant. \n\nOur server was nice, but she seemed like a minor league player, trying to play in the majors. Maybe she was new, but she definitely needs a proper mentor to be better. With a little refinement, she'll be great.",
   "Very Accommodating Service and the Flavors were wonderful. Words such as exquisite, and elegant come to mind when reflecting my off menu vegan visit. Suggest the mushroom Risotto"

   "Best catfish I've had, EVER. And I've eaten a lot of catfish. I thought that I should try something different than what I normally order and ended up trying a special offered on Friday. It had blacked shrimp, fried green tomatoes and fresh greens (the fried green tomatoes are usually served on top of the salad, but I wanted to judge them on their own merit) . It was scrumptious!  I will continue to visit for the catfish but the sides are so tasty.  Hubby's favorite is the black eyed peas, but I love the cabbage and sweet potatoe. \n*Special note: if you have to pay for parking, show your receipt to your server and they will give you a discount.",
   "The fish was well seasoned and cooked well. I ordered my catfish fried extra crispy and it was just perfect to me. Great atmosphere and family vibe. I would definitely return!",
   "I'm on a specific eating plan and Maddie the kitchen manager modified the Ruby Red Trout for me.  She was patient with my requests and was very eager to help me out.  That is HUGE!  My husband loves the blackened catfish and I can not get over how good the trout is.  You won't be disappointed with any of it.  Service, food and atmosphere all combine to make it a dining experience you will want to frequent over and over.",
   "My family loves Soul Fish Cafe! My husband loves that they have whole catfish and he also loves the gumbo. I love pretty much everything on the menu and especially the fried okra and the hushpuppies. My son loves the fried shrimp. We always get seated right away and have always had great service. The only complaint I ever have when I go there is trying to find a parking spot. \ud83d\ude2c",
   "Came on a quiet Sunday evening. There were only a few tables occupied, we got seated right away. The restaurant has a modern feel to it, playing light pop music in the background.  Our waitress Kale was very attentive.  We ordered the blackened catfish. It was delicious. Highly recommended overall."

   "First time here. In town for Wicked. Had the Umami Bomb with an Angus Patty. It was pretty good, but I don't know if I'd say one of the best burgers in America. Arkansas maybe, but I've had better burgers in my hometown. Chicken sandwich was good.  Truffle-garlic fries were good.\n\nAtmosphere is fun and friendly and the service was good. Give it a shot and form your own opinion on the burgers.",
   "A story of the great, the bad and the good. The great - Burgers are great, truly amazing, great beef cooked well, great ingredients - lettuce tomato pickle very fresh, amazing. Truffle fries are really good with a garlic aioli sauce that tastes amazing. The bad - The beer pricing is a little outrageous, Lost 40 and the big orange are owned by the same people and somehow trash panda at the big orange is $8.50 when you can buy a four pack at the brewery for $9?? The good - staff are really friendly, atmosphere is amazing, bathrooms are clean. Overall I would recommend ( maybe get a beer somewhere else though ) and I will be back.",
   "By far one of the most pleasant experiences I have had at a restaurant. Waiter was knowledgeable and made fantastic recommendations.  Was honest about whether or not foods were as advertised or left a little to be desired. The burger was by far one of the best I have had and the beer flight is highly recommended.",

I love potato salad and was told their potato salad was really good, so I tried it. It's made with sweet pickles instead of dill pickles, so kind of made for a weird taste, but it was still good. I'll definitely be going to Gus's again the next time I'm in Little Rock.",
   "We stopped here after a day of hiking. The food was SO delicious! The chicken had just enough spice, and wasn't overly greasy. The fries were the best I've ever tasted! Fries at other restaurants will be incredibly boring after eating these. The staff was friendly, attentive and efficient! Even the owner came over to say \"Hi\". Prices were reasonable!  We need to find one of these in our home state of Minnesota!  \ud83d\ude42 (P.S. My husband enjoyed the home made pie!)",
   "Chocolate chess pie was over cooked, and crust taste burnt. The chicken was hard and taste like  it was cooked in old peanut oil. I've been there many times but haven't  had an experienced like this one. This was a pick up order.(Disappointed ) On a positive note the lady that brought my food to the car was real nice.",

I decided to give it a try and here I am. It happens to be in the downtown area with metered parking. $1.25 for an hour of eating pleasure. Upon entering the restaurant which is cozy I was greeted with a hello and have a seat wherever you would like. My waitress Tia was very prompt and explained the menu choices and answered all my questions. I chose chicken wings, Mac and cheese and potato salad.my meal took 11 minutes to arrive. It was extremely hot and freshly cooked. For dessert I had sweet potato pie. It was excellent. My overall experience was exceptional. I would recommend this restaurant and come back my next trip this way."

Cannot go wrong with any of the Egg Benedict creations such as the Scandinavian salmon and capers!

Have to respect any restaurant that daily makes their mozzarella, which was great. Tomato soup felt like they ran out and gave us some extra pizza sauce.

The atmosphere wasn't super quiet, but it wasn't terribly loud. There just happened to be a party nearby that was a bit boisterous. However, it was a good \"date\" environment. \n\nThe food was really great, and I actually ate all of the food on the plate. Seafood linguine. One thing that they don't have which I feel like an Italian restaurant should have is Angel Hair pasta... OK, it's not really that important, I know. My date liked her meal as well.\n\nI would definitely go back.",
   "I ordered the elk chops, and by far it was THE BEST meat I've ever had in my LIFE. It was perfectly cooked and the texture was soooooo good. The brine they used was perfect and added a great balance of flavor to the elks perfect texture. It had a very red look and then you bite in and it seems to melt in your mouth. The sauce BLEW me away. Also the fried calamari was the best I've had in my life. The flavor was perfectly balanced and fried excellently. The service was excellent and the staff handled our big group very well. Best meal I've had in a long time!",

I was passing through Little Rock and was taken off of the highway by a long shot, but it was worth it.  Lighting and noise were good for conversation with my wife.  Clean both in the dining area and restrooms.",
   "They have some great fish (which is expected). Especially their wood grilled fish  are very good. Quantity was generous during our first visit but wasn't good the second time with the exact same dish! \nTheir rainbow trout is huge while salmon is hit or miss. The sides are pretty good. \n \nThey have a big sitting area and it is not noisy like many restaurants. The service is good as well. I would NOT bother ordering any alcohol as that is super expensive and that's where they get you. I would visit again for the fish! \n\nI would highly recommend buying their gift cards for 20% discount as this restaurant is quite expensive (since it is a chain and they sell too may gift cards).",
   "The Little Rock Bonefish Grill was a great host to our annual family Christmas dinner.  We had 11 adults and 3 children.  We called ahead and made reservations for the group. When we arrived they had the tables put together and menus out on the table.  They brought out children's menus and brought out their food first.  There were 2 wait staff assigned to the table and they kept the drinks coming.  So many restaurants cannot handle groups, but the restaurant did a great job handling the group and being great hosts.  The staff was warm and friendly.  We will definitely consider going here again!",
   "We have always had great experiences here! We went the say before Valentine's day and it was really busy but we were seated within 15 minutes despite not having a reservation. I think our waitress's name was Michelle and she was helpful and nice. (The staff are always superb.) I can be indecisive so she helped us pick drinks and dessert. The bang bang shrimp were an awesome appetizer and are $6 on Wednesday! We splurged and got the guacamole with shrimp as well. We each got the sirloin and crab cake dinner and our steaks were cooked perfectly (medium rare). The portions are good without being over the top and I always leave with at least 1 to go box. The chocolate melting cake with berries for dessert was perfect for sharing."

   "Yuuuuuuummmmmmy food great atmosphere modern yet elegant and up stairs they have a bar lounge. Out on the balcony you can get a good view as well. Staff very professional.",
   "Great food and atmosphere. Pricey- 14 dollars for bacon shown below but it was delicious. The sides are priced well for the portions.",
   "Food doesn't get much better than here. Seabass was so fresh, rigatoni rich in flavor and risotto so creamy (added 3 scallops - cooked beatifully). Great location and service absolutely impeccable!! We had creme brulee and cheesecake for dessert, which were amazing. Easy to spend a lot of money on food and alcohol here, so be careful...but its worth it!!"

   "Nice restaurant! Would have received 5 stars if not for the following. Tables are a little too close for comfort. Steak was under cooked and brussel sprouts were a bit mushy. We expect more attention to detail for the price paid.",
   "Arthur's is wonderful! It is expensive, but you get what you pay for. Service, atmosphere and the food are all great. I don't think you can go wrong with anything off of the menu. I definitely enjoyed celebrating our anniversary there and they made it extra special with the dessert. The creme brulee is awesome and I will go back just to get that. Arthur's is a must!",
   "Wow! This place is totally amazing. Our waiter was super attentive and helpful.  Our food was very delicious. We are celebrating our 17 year anniversary and they gave us a complimentary customized dessert to mark this very special occasion.  Our food was cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",
   "Excellent service! Food is wonderful and owner is in dining area to check on his guests. It is a little pricey, so worth it for a special occasion. Also, love the sparkling light fixtures. A+ Atmosphere.",
   "Prime steak restaurant with great service.  The steaks were delicious and cooked to perfection.  Creamed spinach was creamy and delicious and the scalloped potatoes were top notch.  We ordered some bottles of wine as well and the selection was top tier.  Price was as expected, $$$$, but the food and service matched the price.  If in Little Rock and are looking for a steak dinner where price isnt a factor, this is the place to go."

   "Man I've had some great meals here before but when I was here a couple weeks ago it was a big disappointment. This is a favorite spot in Little Rock especially when I wanna eat something kinda late at night. I still think about the fried rabbit I had a couple years ago. I had the steamed mussels and they were not fresh.  A couple were not even open. I had some in Bethesda the following week and they were like night and day.  The ones I get at home in New Orleans are fresh also. I know my seafood.  I understand Little Rock is more inland but if you can't keep fresh live seafood then it shouldn't be on the menu.  But I've had fresh mussels at other places in Little Rock.  I'm glad I didn't get sick. I gave three stars because my waitress was extremely nice and all the meals I've had here before were good. My waitress was so nice I still left a 20% tip for the original total.  But that was my first and last time having their steamed mussels.",
   "This place was pretty dope. From my understanding, they have seasonal menus, use nice ingredients, and rotate stuff frequently. This was my first time here but the duck confit I got was phenomenal. The drinks were also really awesome, no Ramos gin fizz though. Maybe next time. The staff was super nice and attentive. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be going back soon.",
   "The best resturant I have been to in a very long time. The atmosphere was perfect, romantic, and quaint. The food was unique, very flavorful, and just really very good. The staff were awsome, and made us feel like we had been there 100 times before. Would highly recommend!",
   "Bartender is the reason for the 4 star rating and not 2 or 3 star. \n\nOrdered calamari that was under seasoned and served with cocktail sauce + mariana. 3/5\n\nCocktails were 5/5 hands down. \n\nElderflower is in 75% - 85% of their cocktails. \n\nGreat atmosphere and service. \n\nTotally coming back",
   "Love this restaurant. Service is fabulous.  Food is superb!  Highly recommend the BBQ pork rinds with the spicy maple mayo and the jalapeno cheddar tots, the duck confit was superb and my husband really enjoyed the lamb shank"

My wife said later in the day we've got to go back. The grilled vegetables we're perfect! Will definitely go back",
   "Delicious food and friendly folks! I was traveling through Little Rock and happened to drive by this place and stop in for lunch. I grew up with Greek food and this place does not disappoint with their Mediterranean vibes. The Turkish coffee was delicious, as was the salmon platter and house made rice pudding!",
   "Superb food. Excellent meat quality. We really enjoyed it and can't wait to come back. The staff is very helpful and gave us very good service.",
   "Istanbul is incredible. The food is so delicious and the people that own/run it are so kind. One of our favorite places in Central AR.\n\nThe Beef/Lamb Donner is hard to beat. Their hummus is so smooth and the flavor lacks that sharp finish many others have. Add a Turkish coffee and Profiteroles for a heavenly conclusion.",
   "So I\u2019ve never had this type of food before and I cook a lot. I was very impressed with everything. Seasoned to perfection, the service was on point. Prices are very reasonable. I am definitely going back often and recommending this place to everyone."

Loved the capers in both dishes and how paper was the table cloth, really entertaining for kids to draw. Hostess was fantastic at seating us and bringing color pencils. Do have to say pepperoni pizza was flaccid and way too salty. However, after living in LR for a year now, seems like this is pretty standard for pizza here. Good service and atmosphere.",

Our waitress not only showed a unique passion for each dish, she gave us a greater understanding of the dish itself.

   "I've been wanting to try this place forever but just haven't. The staff was wonderful, the food was good but expensive.\n\nI highly recommend the Xingu beer and the Brasileirissimo Streak - very tasty!\n\nEdit:  I decided to try the Sunday brunch, it was pretty good, but not spectacular (I'm a tough breakfast critic). I had the biscuits with gravy and 2 eggs.  The gravy was not your normal country sausage gravy, the sausage was unique and the result was pretty darned good if a little salty. The biscuits were good, but I found it odd that they toasted them (usually not a sign of home made). The eggs kind of missed the mark - a perfect over medium well egg will have a yoke that is like jelly and no brown skin on whites (I did mention I'm picky about breakfast, right). The eggs missed on both of these marks (brown skin and runny yoke).",
   "Good food. Good service. Very nice place to get together. Dress is casual, but meal seem like it is from a more formal restaurant. We arrived later on Thursday and caught the end of some live music. Very nice. We were told by the singer that there is live music every Thursday.",
   "The Tuesday special was delicious!  Shrimp in a curry sauce on top of rice with sauteed vegetables.",
   "This food is truly something different than the other local restaurants. I don\u2019t have any experience with Brazilian food, but love the food here. I will say that they do move at a slower pace here, so maybe not the best place for a quick meal."

My girlfriend and I had the cheese appetizer. It was very good. My only complaint about it is I wish there was more different types of cheeses. It had several other little finger foods which made it good though. For the main course I had the Italian sub and my girlfriend had the chicken alfredo. My sandwich came with the soup of the day which was a sausage and potato soup. Everything was so good. I will definitely be returning.",
   "Came here for their well regarded Sunday brunch.\n\nLox pizza was 4/5 and gluten free pizza was a 2/5. Only issue is the gluten free crust, which was very small and hard. The topings were a hit though. \n\nGood place for parties of 2 or 4. Amazing huge bar and very nice modern vibe otherwise.",
   "Went there for lunch with a friend. I recommended it because of reviews.  Nice atmosphere.  We were not pressed for time, but did need to get back to a meeting. We asked our waiter how long it may take for a pizza because it looked so good at a nearby table.  She responded rudely that we should expect to wait a bit. She said that we were not the only ones there. I asked if there were smaller pizza options. She stared at us. We opted for a sandwich and a salad. As we waited SEVERAL others were seated around us and began being served...........PIZZA. Quickly.  Apparently, there was some type of lunch special that included......PIZZA.  Funny how our wait person NEVER mentioned it or suggested it.   I ate a $17 sandwich (Italian beef... not great, but good) My friend tried to eat her $12 salad that was drenched so heavy with dressing she was only able to eat the top.  Neighboring tables had pizza. We drank an entire bottle of water with no refill which we would have gladly paid for. Our wait person only returned once....with our tickets. When we left, all three wait staff and hostess were at the bar deep in conversation.  Won\u2019t be back. Our time (and money) were not valued. We had choices and chose here. We will opt other choices in the future",
   "This was our second visit to Raduno. In both cases, the service was attentive without being smothering, and the servers were knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nThe antipasto board included a nice variation of many ingredients, while the burrata was creamy and delicious. \n\nThe pizzas were flavorful, properly dressed, and fired expertly. They were crispy, and held the ingredients expertly. \n\nIf you are looking for good pizza in Little Rock, look no further.",
   "I like this place.  True to it's name, you can get a decent pizza and a cold brew.  The crowd is mixed.  They have an excellent bar which runs most of the depth of the space.  The waitresses and barkeeps are friendly and provide excellent service.  The beers and the food I've had here have been very good.  The atmosphere is laid back and relaxed.  Highly recommend.  Taking a star off because most of the beer selections are IPAs which is the fad now."

Honestly, as a traveler this place is a good place, but not my choice dining for the future. It has a 4.5 stars rating, but I do not know why. The best that I can do and only because they had fried frog legs and it's a buffet; is a 3 rating -Too high of a price per person for a small selection.",

I definitely will drive out of my way to visit this place when I'm in Little Rock. I highly recommend this place.",
   "Love this place, and although I'm not sure if most of it is genuine Japanese food, they have dishes on and off the sushi menu that you can't really find anywhere else in town, especially at a buffet. The food is impressive, the spread is kind of fancy. They have a full and fresh sushi bar with sashimi, and baby octopus and jellyfish salads. The price gets knocked up about $5 on weekends but they typically have different dishes. I recommend to anyone wanting some good Japanese food.",
   "I love this place for lunch- plus it's more affordable. The one time I went for dinner the buffet choices were different and they didn't have my favorite beef dish ( I think it's called kobe beef).  The sushi is amazing. The have \"starter\" sushi for folks like me who enjoy California rolls, but hubby and the kiddo are far more adventurous.  The sushi is made right there and all the ingredients are very fresh.  They even have a fruit sushi roll.",
   "My wife and I went with friends. They have a nice lunch buffet.\nThis was one of our favorite places to eat in West Little Rock\nThey had plenty of choices including shrimp and fish and if you like sushi try this place. I believe the cost was $12.95.\nWe go at least twice a year. \nWe live in the Village so we don't always go to Little Rock for dinner."

Don\u2019t judge this book by its cover - we almost drove on after laying eyes on the haunted-looking house in the middle of a cemetery, but are so glad we didn\u2019t! The buffalo cauliflower, kale salad, and fried green tomato sandwich were particular highlights of an enormous meal bursting with flavors. MeMe was incredibly sweet and warm, and made us feel like guests for a home-cooked meal. An essential stop for vegans and veg-curious diners in Little Rock!",

You aren't at a fast food restaurant, you are getting the opportunity to be fed by someone who is preparing some of the most flavorful food you may have ever eaten. Don't have time to wait?

   "I really liked it.  The atmosphere was really nice.  I actually noticed the flowers on the table were real and fresh.  The staff was very nice and friendly.  The food was delicious and full of flavor.  The skirt steak was moist and had a grill flavor that was out of this world.  Everything was perfect.  I highly recommend this for a dinner spot.",
   "My husband and I have been wanting to go here for a long time, we finally stopped by and it was 200% worth it. We had a three piece empanada, 1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 ham & cheese. All were good but chicken was the best. Shared a Buenos Aires mixed grill that comes with chicken, flank & skirt steak, shrimp & bratwurst. A margarita & beer. Everything was exceptional and we were planning our next visit while eating appetizers. The margarita was very weak, I'll stick to beer going forward.",
   "This is one of our go to date night spots! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is awesome, and the service is exceptional! They catered our iRealty Arkansas Christmas party this year and everybody raved about how good the food was. Love love love this place!",
   "I was so excited to try this place. The service was slow and it took an hour to get our entrees. And then they were cold! The manager (owner?) apologized for the delay and offered a 20% discount but it was still pricey. We paid $85 (with tip) for 2 entrees, 1 kids meal, 2 apps and 2 drinks. I wouldn't have a problem if the food and service were on point.",
   "Excellent service! excellent food and location. Owners are so welcoming and accommodating. Quality of food is amazing and prices are excellent!!! Definitely a place to visit every time in Little Rock, AR"

I have been going to little Greek once a week for about five years now and they consistently crank out amazing food! It\u2019s a little more expensive but it\u2019s worth it for the high quality cuisine and awesome service! Love you guys!!!",
   "Great Mediterranean food! Fast & friendly service, tv\u2019s with sports & news around the eating area, plenty of table or booth seating. Order your food and pay at the counter, take a number and they bring it to you. Greek salad with lamb was \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd.",
   "Very good.  I love the cannoli.  I've never had the dolmades due to not being open minded with leaves.  I tried it with my wife and I have to admit...  They were very delicious and probably the best thing I've eaten in a while.  Five thumbs up.",
   "This was my first time but won\u2019t be my last! I ordered the Gyro platter and my wife and daughter ordered the chicken kabob dinner. We all loved the food. But, the star that stole the show was the fried pita chips with the hummus. The chips were the best I\u2019ve ever eaten! Crispy on the outside soft in the center and absolutely awesome! We will be back! I can highly recommend this clean and inviting restaurant to you!",
   "Omg, I had the chicken pita. The bread was so warm & fresh. I wanted to wrap myself in it like a blanket. Will definitely be back soon."

Not only is the food excellent (never had a dish I didn\u2019t love!) with an atmosphere that is elegant yet very comfortable and obvious it\u2019s frequented by neighborhood locals!! The staff and owners are super and wait staff make you feel as though you are friends! Love this downtown restaurant!! 5 stars!",

   "Delicious food, fast service, and friendly staff.  The menu is very simple yet jam packed with flavor.  I had the Half and Half dumpling and noodle bowl with chicken and medium heat on my first trip. The bowl was filling and appropriately priced.  Great atmosphere with a modern vintage vibe.  I will absolutely return.",
   "Awesome Food very very fresh my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. The chef was very nice and attentive. The guy that took our order was very polite. I advise one thing though from the other guy at the register.  Don't know if this guy owned the place or what but we can tell he either judged us for who we are or he was having a bad day. This was our very first time eating here and I looked online prior to coming to the restaurant so I asked for  the two fold noodle bowl. So he was being arrogant and stated that is the name of the restaurant but if you look at your menu you have a salad named  the two fold salad right under the noodle bowl. I will not let his attitude affect my experience. Very Very Good fresh food minus the attitude. I totally recommend!!!!",
   "My sandwich was so salty that I could not eat it.  I also had the pork dumplings and they we good but nothing to make a special trip for.  People were not as friendly one would like.  The atmosphere was good."

The desert were delicious and we cannot day enough good things about this service oriented restaurant!",
   "As someone who is both a regular customer and a former employee here, I can confidently say that S\u00f5 offers one of the greatest dining experiences in Arkansas. The cooks are all exceptional at creating phenomenal dishes, and the head chef continues to top himself with a creative special each week, while the front house staff are attentive and consistently on point. If you're looking for top notch food and service at a reasonable price, S\u00f5 is where to go.",
   "I typically would not post this type of review for the public to see. I contacted the restaurant in private, saw that they read my note and 48 hours later, still no response. So, here is the note I sent to SO Restaurant. \u201cI visited your restaurant for the very first time last night, NYE. It\u2019s a beautiful facility, charming and elegant. Our waiter was Brock. We had a 5:30 reservation for 6. We were seated promptly. We all ordered from the NYE limited menu. 5 of us got the oysters as our appetizer. The oysters were room temperature. It was an item that should be hot, melting cheese from being under the broiler. The oysters in the Bienville were very strong, fishy tasting/smelling. Very disappointing dish all around the table. The Turtle soup was ordered by most of us for the next course. It had good flavor, but has also room temp, not even warm. Again, very disappointing. Most of us ordered the prime rib for our main course. The mashed potatoes were divine, as was the asparagus with shaved yams. Delicious. The seasoning on the prime rib was excellent. The prime rib however, was also not warm, and mine was very, very tough. Difficult to cut. Just a terrible cut of meat. The desserts were hit and miss. Pineapple cake was great. The cheese plate was cold brie and a glob of apricot jelly. Just terrible. Never had cold brie cheese.  The chocolate truffles were awful, dense, dry, hard, just awful. We ordered coffee and it took 3 times reminding Brock for us to get it, one in a dirty cup, and not hot. It was bad. It took 3 times asking Brock in order to get a glass of tea. Brock was frazzled, kind of high strung, odd. I wanted to inform you of our experience and I would never want to put this on public social media. We are all professional people and we eat at fine dining establishments often. Our tickets had a 20% tip automatically added in. I thought that was tacky. I felt this may have been the single most overpriced meal I have ever had then was forced to pay 20% for mediocre service from our waiter. I feel terrible even writing all this, but the owner of this establishment deserves to know this.\u201d",
   "Nice, quiet sophisticated spot! Pork chops with the ghost pepper glaze, off the chain. Will definitely be back!!"

They have a tasty salsa that is more flavorful than spicy. That have a large food and drink menu with all American-Mexican classics all at a decent price. Don't forget to grab a lime mint on your way out!",
   "great food and staff. place was clean. my only issue with this place was how often people were coming by to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything. its good you care about your customers just give them a little breathing room to enjoy there meal. if there drink is getting low simply just bring them another one you don't need to ask every time you see a glass half full.",
   "Service was great.  Good food.  The restaurant looked very clean and neat. Loved the wood designs on the tables. I'll visit again.",
   "My husband and I were looking for really good salsa. We saw the reviews for this restaurant on Google and decided to try it. We have driven past this for years but never stopped. We were not disappointed! Salsa and the green salsa was excellent! I had the Ala Diable chicken. The meat was well done and had tons of flavor. The refried beans were great! My husband had the street tacos and he really enjoyed. We will be coming back as our \u201cgo to\u201d for Mexican food!",

There is plenty of seating and I beleive that when the weather is nice they have outdoor seating as well. There are dedicated handicap spaces in front of restaurant but the rest is street parking or in a nearby grocery store lot. My friend and I went last night as we heard that there was a late night happy hour from 10pm to 12am. Most of the appetizers are half price (shrimp is not). Everything is beautifully presented and the food is always delicious! Can't wait to be back.",
   "Warm, cozy environment envelops you to a place away from it all. Being a hummus junkie, it did lack a little flavor\ud83e\udd14, but every other dish tried was highly flavorful. They serve traditional drinks but also have delicious, unique cocktails if you're up for trying something new.",
   "The food was top notch -\nquality ingredients and tasty central European dishes. The Hungarian sausage with the egg noodles and vegetable medley was prefect. I\u2019ll return here the next time visit Little Rock.",
   "First time to try this restaurant and I will say it didn't let us down. The beef stroganoff was off-the-wall great, as was the breaded Jager schnitzel!! Share the dessert-Chocolate Salami- rich & delicious.",
   "One of my favorite restaurants in the area.  Always excellent service and we really enjoy the drinks.  In particular love that the kitchen stays open pretty late.  I go here regularly and have no reason to stop.  My favorite place in the neighborhood and one of my favorites in the city."

   "I have heard a lot about Doe's over the years and FINALLY I had a chance to try it. The food is not bad but I've had better seasoned steak. We ordered the 4lb sirloin and split it among the 4 of us. Its a unique atmosphere but sadly not worth the hype for me. However, if you go please do try the homemade chocolate cake!",
   "Small unsuspecting spot for steak family style. Order your steak type (or shrimp) and it comes with sides for the table family style. Steak was good and homemade fries were too; not sure we needed the red potatoes AND fries but that\u2019s how it comes. Friendly staff.",
   "Some of the best, juiciest steak in Little Rock, served in a unique family style. Doe's has always impressed and they remain a landmark location downtown. If you want the porterhouse though, be sure to reserve one ahead of time!",
   "Was told I had to go and try the porterhouse and went an did that for my birthday. Very nice dinner, and a small little hole in the wall kind of restaurant, but was delicious and well worth the money."

   "Ok... \u201cAll you can eat brunch\u201d and they have cocktails & Mimosas. I mean really, when was the last time you went to a cafeteria style, family friendly buffet and had a Bloody Mary? Well, it was a first for me.\n\nOpen dining hall in the newly renovated \u201cpaint factory\u201d. Very friendly and accommodating staff. The menu changes on a regular basis. The offerings today included pulled pork, chicken tenders and greens to go along with the usual breakfast options.\nAnd of course they had awesome biscuits with your choice of white or \u201cchocolate\u201d gravy.\n\nEverything was very good, but they do have an opportunity to improve their freshly prepared eggs. I suggest perhaps a separate \u201cstation\u201d or table. I ordered eggs over easy (willing to wait for them), but our waitress brought them to the table and they were over cooked.\n\nOh yeah, they have biscuits as big as a \u201cCat\u2019s Head\u201d. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d",

My husband and I are both in the hospitality industry and understand how hectic it can be to work on a busy day. However, as this was our first time coming to dine we would have loved an explanation from our server on the process, instead she said something along the lines of,  \u201cgo on up\u201d. Would have loved to give it 5 stars, but the service was lacking.",

   "Food was amazing and very super surprising! I am a big critic when it comes to soul food especially greens! Most of the downtown area does not have good greens but this place had some good greens and they seasoned it so well. And oh my gosh let\u2019s not get started on the tator casserole!! To die for! I\u2019m a big dessert person and their peach cobbler and bread pudding was the bomb! What also made this place great was the service and the owner. Being an owner myself to a few restaurants, I understand the importance of being present and infront of the restaurant. Makes people feel good and happy they are talking to the chef!"

The food is unique and always delicious, the service and speed is impeccable, and we've literally never had anything other than a perfect experience here.

   "Great locally family owned restaurant. I've heard about it from friends from France as well as Little Rock foodies. The restaurant is able to accompany a surprisingly large number of people. If you want a Sunday brunch, get there early as the line was about  a quarter way down the block. Metered Parking only, is not free during the week, but it is on the weekends. An ever changing menu based on locally sourced products and seasonal food make each experience unique and varied. Delicious. Great for casual dining.",

Seeing as we are from the Great Northwest, we had never EVER had grits taste mouth watering like those! And the biscuits, please...my mouth is watering while I type this, they are phenomenal! We ate every last bite of food we ordered, it was so marvelous. I wish I could tell you when I would ever go back through Little Rock, Arkansas just to eat there again.",
   "Fun little place! I loved the retro/modern diner decor. Food was very good. Hubby wasn't happy that it took so long for the food to come out. I was very happy with the locally sourced food and my healthy breakfast of avocado toast and berries. Hubby got the Dutchman burrito. Both were great! Good place to go if you are not in a hurry."

The servers are always sweet and prompt to take care of filling your drink even when it is a buffet and they don't typically make as much. The food is incredible and the price is maybe a dollar higher than the average fast food lunch. Definitely worth a visit!",
   "Our go-to place for Indian. We prefer to go during the buffet, which is available seven days a week. Food for the whole family, even our picky eater!\n\nGreat soup, and a variety of dishes! Large varieties of meat, vegetarian, and vegan dishes. The tofu curry is really good!\n\nChicken curries, lamb curries, vegetable curries, several types of naan, roasted vegetable dishes, grilled chicken, grilled fish, spinach salad.\n\nI'm a big fan of the curried lentil, curried tofu, saag paneer. Family also loves the Tandoori chicken, Tandoori fish, curried chicken, curried chickpeas.\n\nThere is just too much food food dishes and options to list them all.",
   "My husband and I ate here last night for the first time, and our experience was amazing!  The food was fresh and delicious, despite my pretty intense allergy to turmeric...no rash or anything, but lots of dizziness which paired quite well with my two Indian Mules, I must say ;D.  The highlight, though was the excellent service.  The manager and staff were extremely attentive and friendly.  All things paired with the beautiful, cozy ambiance of this little gem will certainly be bringing us back again and again.  Loooove this spot! ",
   "Wow. Great food, including some of my favorite goat dishes, and black tie service that's unbeatable. Our meals were ready very quickly, but came out piping hot and delicious. The garlic naan is to die for. I would wholeheartedly recommend Star of India to anyone who enjoys eating authentic Indian foods.",
   "This is the spot! Treat yourself to the Lamb Vindaloo. Let em know of you like it spicy. They can turn up the heat. I usually just let him tell me what I want when I go here. Very nice people too! 5 stars! I'm a fan a and a regular."

   "Oh my god! This place is amazing. Juan was the best server I have had in years. Very nice guy that made you feel right at home. He brought out different runs for us to smell and gave us the history on them. The food was just out of this world. Some of the best food I have ever had. First time here and we had a great time. Please go see Juan. Thank you guys very much. We will be back soon!",
   "I just move back to Little Rock and this is one of my favorite places to dine alfresco. The atmosphere inside is a little bright for evening dining but this is one of my favorite places in Little Rock because hearing the sounds of Puerto Rico and the Dominican republic is so refreshing to have in Little Rock. The upbeat sound of salsa makes dinner lovely while in a cozy and tranquil setting.  When my friends visit from the islands, I like to take them here.",
   "This place is a GEM! The owner Sarah accommodated our group last minute. They have a special party room that was perfect for our group. She and her staff were incredible attentive and gave helpful suggestions. The drinks were delicious. The arrepas were yummy but the paella was INCREDIBLE! One of the best restaurants in Little Rock. Parking is on the street but easy to find. They also have outdoor seating when the weather is nice. They have happy hour specials and fun themed nights. Will definitely be back! Also, the owners are amazing! I would come back for their hospitality alone.",
   "Had the braised beef dish with black beans, fried plantain, and fried egg.  The dish had good seasoning and flavors and the beef was juicy.  Really enjoyed the plantains and black beans too.  Would prefer a runnier egg but still tasted great.\n\nAdditionally, our server was spot on!  Excellent service and very knowledgeable.",
   "My husband and I ate there for our 23rd anniversary.  He is a native of Venezuela and he enjoyed the food and dessert tremendously.  The staff was friendly, the food was hot and service was excellent! We will definitely be going back to enjoy more delicious entrees!"

   "Was with a large party (about 30) in the large room. Had one waiter for all 30. He was great but it took forever to get our meals and forever to pass them out. Food was cold when we were ready. Should have allowed for at least 2 people to help. I had blackened chicken and wife a steak. Chicken was flavorless...basically just a extra well cooked semi charred piece of chicken. Seemed to have no seasoning on it like you would think \"blackened\" would have - it was 2$ extra for the blackened. Steak was tough and not worth the cost. The 1 star came from the salad bar - it was good. I should have just got that. I was not the only one that had issues with the food. This was my first visit and my last.....",
   "Excellent service nice wine selection and the desserts are delicious",
   "Went for valentine's day with my husband.  We had a great time and, as always,  the food was fantastic!  Great service,  as well.  Its pricey, so we don't go often.  But when we go for special occasions,  it never disappoints!!",
   "The steak was fantastic. The service we received from our waiter Stephen was not however. Out of our party of four, only one steak was cooked how we asked for it. I asked the manager as he was going by if we could get our correct steaks. No problem. However when Stephen our waiter came back he made a passive aggressive comment about how he would\u2019ve liked the chance to fix the situation himself. Serving assistant chip was fantastic as well. I think Stephen might have been an outlier.",
   "Server was very friendly! Salad bar was outstanding. The filet was slightly over cooked and had a very strong pepper coating."

The food, of course, was great and it's always a keen type of entertainment when you see how they cook and prepare the food. It's mostly cooked well to where soy sauce is not a heavy need. And yes they do all the food tricks. Good for the family or even a couple's date."

   "Great service and great food. Nice job.",
   "Came on a Monday night and was not disappointed in food or service. The atmosphere was the usual low light calm with background music of most upscale American bistros, which is perfect for fine dinning in my opinion. The place was had only 3-4 other tables one of which was Asa Hutchinson (our current governor)so I assume he enjoys it. My table had the Veal chop, shrimp and grits, wagyu short rib, and red snapper(I think). Everything was close to perfect. My veal chop was cooked a little much, no pink in the middle, but it was still delicious and I hate to be \"that guy\" so no biggie. The smoked Gouda grits were amazing. The short rib was so tender you could cut it with a spoon. The shrimp and grits and red snapper were cooked perfectly as well, highly recommend. All our plates were wiped Clean and we were all satisfied. For cocktails we had the Animal farm bacon bourbon old fashioned and the Night to remember a mezcal with apricot liquor and blue berry lavender syrup. Both obviously delicious.",

Their appetizer list is pretty awesome, especially their Loaded Rocket Tots! We like the atmosphere as well.  The front area is great for sunny days, with tons of windows.",

   "Great place to get a bite or a drink. Their drink selection is vast, and they have $4 taps all day Monday and 4-7pm Tues-Fri. Their food is exceptional as well. It's a bit of a pound environment, so don't expect a quiet place, but it's a bar; what do you expect? I highly recommend."

The chicken and waffles is quite good, as are the beignets which are definitely worthwhile. The pricing is very reasonable and the atmosphere is upscale with nice views of the Arkansas River as well as the garden and a very nice patio that is shaded by the library itself. My daughter ate all of her Nutella crepes and they also have a good selection of a la carte.",
   "First let me say that the bartender was worth visiting again. He was nice, entertaining, and made a great negroni. Also, the filet was excellent. Those reasons are why this place gets 3 stars. It got dinged because our server actually complained about us bringing in our own wine(which I'm pretty sure is not illegal) and he proceeded to do a piss-poor opening and presentation after we told him we could just open ourselves if he was going to be so put out by it. UGH. He also vocalized his frustration at us paying and tipping the bartender before we sat down so that he missed that tip. Dude, you didn't mix our drinks and entertain us, bartender did. Bartender gets the tip. He tried to recover with light banter but had already lost us as an audience. Several slightly snide comments later he tells us that we were supposed to be one of his VIP tables(humble brag). Could have fooled us, buddy! I hate to see how he treats the rude tables if that were true. Also, we felt rushed. Here's the deal, we like to eat, drink, and talk and are happy to pay for the privilege to do so in your establishment. We do not want to feel unwelcome or hurried. The biggest hint that it was time for us to leave was when our server told us that we probably wouldn't want any of the desserts that he had left and he didn't want to bother the kitchen. OOOOkkkkaaayyyy. Never mind then. Turned out that the kitchen was not bothered a bit and sent out a sampler plate. And they were all good. Winner. Too late to order a cup of coffee though, it wasn't ten o'clock yet. Then the valet came up to our table, asked if this was the key to our car, tossed it on the table, and turned tail. Saved that tip money, I guess. \n\nWe have been baffled lately by some of the poor service we've received at some of the pricier restaurants in town and 42 is not immune to this epidemic. \n\nAgain, bartender was cool. Food was good. Server was neither. Valet was lame. Get it together, team.",
   "Food is great and reasonably priced. Also, the personnel is very accommodating with large parties."

   "Can\u2019t help but order the Peanut Stew every time (beef is much more flavorful than chicken to me) but the jollof Rice is also amazing, and the plantains are delicious. I\u2019ve never gone wrong at Kontiki. Ginger beer is very strong, which is a good thing in my opinion, but may be too much for some.",
   "I really liked the cleanliness of the restaurant & it seemed family friendly. That being said, it was a little sterile. There was no music playing and I expected to feel emerged in an West African type of experience. I had the couscous & chicken. The food had generous portions of couscous and fresh vegetables, but the chicken didn't seem to be marinated in the sauce (which there wasn't enough of). The waitress was nice & brought me my water, but never came by my table to refill my drink or to ask how the food was. I hope they expand their menu and add items like chicken yasa, provide Maggi sauce, or popular African deserts. I will definitely give this restaurant another chance and maybe try another dish."
