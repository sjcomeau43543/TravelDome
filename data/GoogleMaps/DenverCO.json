  "Normally a great place to eat. But all of our meals were not good tonight. I'm positive my 5 cheese ziti only has 2 cheeses and was hard before I drove home 10 minutes. Trying to support local business. Also half the people working at this location couldn't even pretend to be in a good mood.",

  "Hadn't been here in over a year and decided to come revisit. The food, compared to past visits, was very bland, not a lot of flavor. Our waitress wasn't very attentive either. When she came to check on us one time to ask how everything was I tried to tell her there was no gnocchi in my soup but left upon hearing my husband say he was ok. I don't know what's happened in the past year but the food and service just aren't what they used to be and its disappointing to say the least.",

  "Friendly service! Generally we LOVE Good Times; especially their breakfast burritos.  But, today, not so much.  The green chili and eggs seemed fine, but the burritos themselves were smaller than usual (they aren\u2019t huge normally), flat, and just seemed off a bit.  The potatoes were undercooked, the bacon odd, and the tortillas were tough and chewy. Maybe they were old/stale. They were edible, but not fresh and delicious! Three stars because of green chili, eggs, and service.",
  "Spicy chicken is way too spicy for my liking but what I really liked was there veggie option, southwestern style was pretty good. Also the buffalo style burger was horrible, it seemed that it was done on purpose, both sides completely SATURATED with the spiciest buffalo sauce you can imagine. The sauce was even drenched on the Bread sadly. I was excited to try this establishment, as it seemed like a great option at the time, but I won\u2019t be bringing my business here anymore sadly. Was kinda hoping it would be the \u201cin n out\u201d of Colorado.",
  "My favorite fast food burger when I get a craving. Reasonably priced and made fresh.",
  "I don't normally leave reviews, but today was a horrible experience... soft and undercooked wild fries, and the mac and cheese was literally a pile of plain noodles with cheese \"melted\" on top. I couldn't even use the provided plastic fork, it all came out as one huge block. Worst mac and cheese I've ever had. The burger was the only saving grace, but even that wasn't up to the usual standards. Probably will not come back again in the future, overall disappointed and very dissatisfied with my experience today.",
  "The food tastes fine HOWEVER I\u2019ve been writhing in pain all night because I ate here. It\u2019s 3 am and i can\u2019t sleep because of the horrible pain. I\u2019ve never had such a reaction to fast food before. Really concerning."

We got our food pretty fast but it was   cold.  Plus the amount of grease in the burger was horrendous. I've been to many burger places in my life time and there has never been a burger I've eaten that's been this greasy, if you barely squeezed the bun or tilted it the burger in your hands it would start running. We also witnessed the bartender give her customers a 4 day old drink in a dingy looking plastic bottle that she specifically told them was that old and was gonna throw out.

  "There is no GM for this store or the one down the road.  The manager does not actively participate in the workplace during average dinner hours.  When ordering a black bean crunch wrap supreme, which I had to repeat saying because they put the meat one down, it rang up as 3.99 when posted as 3.69 on their menu and website.  This is called price fixing and is illegal and morally unbearable.  We called the manager and left a voicemail but had no choice to go down to the road for del taco.  The employee said there was nothing she could do about the price.  How about get training?",
  "Worst service imaginable! Couldn't ever call this place fast food and it's every time I go here. This last time I literally sat for 10 minutes at the window waiting to pay while our food was already ready for some guy to sit there and count out his drawer by the penny right in front of us at the window. Where's the management here????",
  "The last 4 times I have came to this taco bell, my order has been messed up, or there's food missing, etc. This by far is the worst I've gotten from here. The only good thing from the order tonight was the spicy potato soft tacos I had. This quesadilla made me gag from the burnt taste.. super disappointed. I'll be going to the other taco bell on Belleview and Kipling from now on.",
  "Store says they open at 7:30 but orders don't start until about 8:30. They say they close at 3 am but they really like to close at 2 am. Not to mention how many times they run out of baja blast...Customer service is garbage too. One of the worse taco bells I've been to."

  "Clean space. Broth 3. Brisket not tender 3. I asked for vegetable instead of noodles\u2014apparently not many people do that. But they did it for me and it was a good amount of meat and vegetable. I can speak to the other dishes, but as for Pho, I will keep on searching for my \u201c5\u201d place."

  "I pass this lake very often and like it a lot! It\u2019s very beautiful at all times of the day and it is a decent sized lake. I appreciate the benches on the sides so that you can sit and enjoy the view. The grass surrounding the lake is pretty poky and so it\u2019s not very nice to sit on or play duck duck goose in but that\u2019s a minor issue. One time there was this  dude that passed me on my run and I got very negative energy from him so I just looked at the lake to avoid eye contact so it helped get me through a potentially awkward situation. Yeah, this is a nice lake surrounded by rich people\u2019s houses so I\u2019d give it a thumbs up.",

  "I am totally in love with this pizza place. It is my go to when ordering or eating at the restaurant. The service is always great! And the food is always delicious I have been to multiple locations and I have not been disappointed. If you like spicy my go to pizza is the Tahoe so unique and tasty. And the wings with dry rub are the best! Definitely recommend!",
  "Very disappointing. Not a fan of overcooked,  dark crust.\nMike's pizza is hands down the best value and quality in any zipcode on the south side.",

All I can say is thank you.",

If that's not your style, try our one of the others, or even get a fritter the size of your head. This place has been around forever, and once you try it, you'll see why. The staff is friendly.

  "I happened upon this restaurant by accident, so I stopped in. I've been sampling Cajun cooking in the metro area, and did not want to ignore the promptings of Fate or Chance! I ordered two bowls of gumbo for home. They proved to be very tasty. The roux was rich and spicy, and it seemed quite authentic. My only complaint: the ingredients were a bit skimpy. The clams and shrimp in one gumbo were rather tiny and bland. You couldn\u2019t really tell one from the other. The other gumbo I ordered was chicken and sausage. The sausage pieces were small, and not particularly spicy; the chicken had been overcooked so it was only threads. The hush puppies, however, were quite good.",

  "So far it's been a hit or miss, mostly miss. I'll get a pizza that looks like they ran out of cheese, pizza not completely covered with cheese. \nThis last visit was the worst pizza. Not completely covered in cheese, not well done and my veggie pizza had all sorts of meats mixed in. As a vegetarian that hasn't had pork, beef etc in over a decade, this was seriously disturbing. I emailed them letting them know of my disappointment, no response as of yet. So it bothered me enough to call the store and complain and ask how jalapeno and olives could possibly translate to Canadian bacon, beef, and whatever the other meat was. I guess I was looking for more reassurance on the QC, that they'd speak to staff to be more alert, or any suggestions for me to help them do their job right. The manager, Josh's response was basically , there's a  don't similar pizza on their menu  but that has meat on it, I don't know what happened, we're understaffed, but I can give you a free pizza.... I said fine, but I guess I'll wait a few months when they're hopefully adequately staffed and possibly interested in satisfying customers.\nJust all around disappointed in the quality of their product, lack of assurance, and customer service skills.\n  |\n  |\n V\nEdit 10/18/19\nCalled in my order, guy on the phone was nice and said it would be ready in 30. Got there a little early, pizza was ready, order was accurate, and the young guy was nice. I'll have to order when he's working. Faith restored \ud83d\ude0e",
  "Great pizza every time. The new sandwiches we're so good. The meatball sandwich was sideways in the box but it just made it finger licking good.",
  "Normally have great service here until now. Was left waiting 2 hours for delivery then was told it would be another half an hour and then the order came the pizza was soggy and it was the completely wrong order. Not impressed. And papa johns would not even answer the phone after I had ordered it.",
  "Don't order the pan pizza. They don't know the difference between \"crispy\" and \"burnt\". Those are my pics of the top and bottom of my pizza. My daughter (who is NOT picky) tried eating a piece and couldn't. The crust was burnt and hard. It was late enough that we made something else and then I took the pizza back while my mom put the kids to bed. They did admit it was left in \"a couple extra minutes\"... Ya think??? Why the heck did you deliver it then?? A call to say we had to make another one would have kept me coming back, but the way they handled it has left me never wanting to come back.\nUpdate: it's been a year and still not back. I hope there's a better crew now.",
  "My partner ordered a pizza here last night. It was never delivered and while he called over 20 times the phone was never answered. He called this morning and someone answered finally and told him they\u2019d process a refund but there wasn\u2019t a single apology or explanation why this happened which is honestly just terrible customer service."

Great as a green oasis among the city with a couple coveted spots for picnics.",

  "I took my dog to this peaceful, spotless park and we didn't have to sit in duck poo. The park is very well manicured with beautifully working fountains. It's nice to go to parks where bums aren't approaching us for stuff and surveillance cameras are around for added security. 5 stars.",

What is impressive is the variety of cured meats and cheeses with a full description of each type so that each person can tailor their own charcuterie.  Great happy hour daily from 2:30 to 6:30.  Staff is professional.  Landmark is a great location for dining,  entertainment and shopping.",

The gentleman behind the bar was personable but when I didn't show any interest in getting a drink the customer service began to lack.

I was going to a comedy show downstairs and the staff got my tickets for the show. The seats were upgraded for dining with the restaurant.\n\nIf you are looking for a good meal, I would recommend checking out Lucy Restaurant.",

Prices are very decent for the higher class dining experience you get. I tried the brussel sprouts and southwest egg rolls both were really good. My friend got the roasted pumpkin kale salad and it was absolutely amazing! One of the best salads I've ever had!",

Hannah was our server and was very refreshing to talk to and made sure we were taken care of. This place isn\u2019t just a typical breakfast place, and was a great experience.",
  "Going above and beyond is at the core of this business. When we tried to order a specific kinda of mimosa that my friend had tried there months ago, Manager Travis went above and beyond, asking what was in it, remaking the recipe from scratch, and even offering to make up the honey syrup in advance anytime we planned to swing by, as long as we called. The food was also to die for (highly recommend the chili cakes!) over all this place deserves 10 stars for the staff's amazing attitude and the delightful atmosphere and food! Below is the honeysuckle mimosa recipe if you want to try it!"

  "Beer prices are good. Location is also convenient. But...\nUsed to have good quality food with seasonal updates to the menu that made coming fun and refreshing each trip. I'd often bring by friends before and after shows at the comedy bar across the way. At some point last year though I noticed a sharp change in the taste and quality of the food. After a few disappointing trips in I had to figure out what happened.  It was after talking to some staff it seems there was a change in ownership. You could notice a drop in taste and presentation. I asked why the place always seemed busy so cutting cost didn't seem necessary and I was told the owner didn't really communicate with the rest of the staff.  Chicken tenders used to be so good I loved getting off work down the street and coming by for made in house tasty beer battered chicken and a few beers, and now its processed meat that you could grab from Walmart/Costco for half the price and I would get a larger portion in a meal. Also the Irish staple corned beef used to have more flavor and was ready to fall apart. Now it tastes significantly lower in quality and is tough and cut too thick. It's a shame so many new owners make the mistake of sacrificing quality when switching over. Colorado has had sub par food for years but in the last 10 we've seen a boom in small restaurants embracing the creative side of food and making it from scratch. Quality shows hopefully they revert to the from scratch instead of fast food. They also seemed to have replaced most the male staff with attractive women which is awesome no complaints there.",
  "Happy hour is decent, but our server had a look of disdain when we ordered appetizers with our drinks when she first came by.  I had the urge to just get up and walk out, but once she composed herself things were fine.  I understand that happy hour is probably very busy at Landmark, but if you can't handle it, add more wait staff. Don't take it out on the people visiting your establishment.",
  "A great place to visit and have couple late night drinks. I think the place would benefit from having more experienced servers, it really seemed like the overall group was very young and even though I'm only 30 I couldn't make any meaningful connections with servers. The community around you though is amazing and its easy to mingle",
  "On Valentine's Day 2020, we had a group of 10 at Slattery's for dinner.  We had reserved the private seating area (curtained off) for parties.  Slattery's really took great care of us!  The menu has great food selections... the Slattery's Burger with a fried egg, the Lamb Stew, the Rueben, etc., but just as important, the service was terrific.  Our waitress was Odegard -- ask for her!  She got everything right, and got us across the street on time for our show at The Comedy Works.  Stellar service!  Highly recommend.",
  "Slattery's is a mixed bag:  Always a good place to get a drink but food is so-so.  We had some great meals there, we live just a few block away and have been going there for years.  I got one of the best hamburgers I've ever had there last year.  But, their salads which have always been great, have gone down hill with new owners.  The chicken they use to add to the salads use to be freshly cooked to perfection but now its always over cooked.  I am told that the chicken is now pre-cooked to speed-up turn around time.  And, I don't know what the white stuff is they are passing of as goat cheese - cream cheese maybe?  If anyone knows what this fake goat cheese is, please post.  Any way, we still go there now and again but where as everything on their menu use to be great now we have to be more careful what we order when we go, no more salads. Oh, the fish & chips is still great, at least the fish part of the meal is.   However, sometimes when you order a sandwich, despite the menu saying its made on sourdough bread, you might get it made on a ciabatta roll with the excuse, \"we don't have any bread\".  There are a couple of other pretty good restaurants  right next to Slattery's you might want to try."

Sushi was a bit higher quality than other places in the area and is priced accordingly. As other reviewers have noted the magic \"mushrooms\" are a delicious starter. Also tried the multi orgasm roll which was amazing. For drinking, try the mango infused sake. Its served cold and is fantastic! Parking is simple in the garage across the street.",

  "Wow, based on previous reviews we were already expecting this place to be good, but how great it really was, blew us away. Simply delicious fish, and creative but not awkward done rolls. The happy hour drink specials (in the middle of the weekend) was the cherry on top. If you like sushi, you have to try this place out.",

  "Wonderful little place. They had lemon soup, something we were hoping for. It was so good and tasted just like it should. Music wasn't blasting like it is in most restaurants these days, which was perfect because I was having dinner with a friend and we just wanted to sit and stuff ourselves with good food and catch up. We weren't the only ones either with that idea, there were a lot of others who just sat and talked and enjoyed. It was such a different atmosphere than most places I've been to in Denver- felt like visiting with family who feed you well. \nMy friend and I shared a couple combo platters, 2 cups of the amazing lemon soup and a yummy yoghurt with honey and nuts. The establishment is clean, staff are laid back but professional and the food is authentic and tasty.  I'm looking forward to coming back.",

The bread included was another phenomenal addition.\n\nThe staff was all very pleasant to interact with.  Will definitely be going back for dinner and glass of wine.",
  "First time here. Vibe was good! The food was different than anything I have ever had, which was very good. We ate a late lunch - about 2pm on a Friday. The service was a bit slow for there only being three couples in the entire restaurant. (Reason for four stars) The restaurant was very clean and loved the decor. If it were later in the day, I definitely would have tried a cocktail or three at their nice bar! Something I thought was a nice touch, was the gentleman who I thought was either the owner or manager, escorted us to our table. \n\nAs a side note: two young, nicely dressed, teenage boys, quietly entered the restaurant with their skateboards in hand. They walked over to one of the tables and sat down. Each had their own soda, and were there approximately ten mins. I was about 3 tables away from them and watched the entire time. The owner or manager saw one of the boys plus his phone into the charger on the wall next to the table he was sitting at. Very sternly he said, \u201c Do you have permission to do that?\u201d Repeating himself again, the boys quietly said no. The manager/owner said you can leave. The boys in shock quietly, and politely gathered their drinks, skateboards and phone and walked out of the restaurant. \nNow, I say all this looking at it from both sides. As an owner you don\u2019t want people/kids just plugging in and staying all day and not buying anything. But as a mom, I saw two very quiet, polite, young teens. One needing to charge his phone. Maybe next time the manager/owner could have not made a scene, and asked the boys if they were going to get anything, and maybe explain the way \u2018his\u2019 rules work.",

  "For the prices, the value did not match. The atmosphere is super cute and the service is impeccable. But we are here cause we came to eat food. I ordered  2 eggs over easy with corn fritters, chicken sausage and a cheddar biscuit. Eggs were done well, bravo to that cook. The presentation turned me off right away. The fritters (hush puppies) were floating around on the plate. Maybe put them in a cone vessel with parchment paper. Or just a boat to contain them.  Second the mini chicken sausage link was cut in half as if doing me a favor. Why can\u2019t you just give me 2 links, like a normal person? Why cut 1 link to TRY and trick my mind like I\u2019m getting something special. I feel like you won\u2019t lose cost with the supply of 2 sausages for your paying guest? That\u2019s a question.  Cheddar biscuit, dry. Old. It was HUGE and not served with butter or jam which I needed to ask for. Strange there isn't any on the table for a being a brunch place. Also, your doll house salt and pepper shakers are sad. That must be annoying for your servers to fill all the time. But also provide adults with adult size things. I know you have it in you. That dry cheddar biscuit...",
  "Heard many good things about this place and decided to go.  Our server was enthusiastic however the food didn't match his enthusiasm. The food took a lot longer to prepare and was only warm.  Overall the quality of the food didn't match didn't live up to the price charged.  Next time I visit Denver I might go elsewhere to eat breakfast.",
  "We love coming here for breakfast. Sometimes the wait can get a little long but worth the wait. The food was delicious. The service was attentive. Even though it was busy the food came out within a reasonable amount of time. Nice having this breakfast spot at the Landmark.",
  "The food here is good, at least on par with the restraints around, pleasant atmosphere and friendly service. \n\nHowever the prices are definitely higher then the competition for the same or slightly lower quality. $13.00 for a breakfast burrito. $3.50 for coffee (when the average is $2.50-$3). 4.25 for a side of bacon (when I can get an entire pack of the best quality for $5-$6 at the market 5 minutes away). These prices are just not reasonable for what your getting in my opinion, and not competitive with restraints in the area. Honestly I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be coming back just because my money goes much further elsewhere. On the upside the wait is very short even during prime time on Saturday morning.",

  "Love this place. The light atmosphere and friendly staff make this place very cozy and welcoming for every customer. I often visit it to have a coffee break, relax while sipping their delicious ice latte or hot cocoa. The service is also is on top. Thank you guys for maintaining such a friendly and cozy place.",
  "Modern, chic coffee cafe. Staff was friendly, lattes were fairly quick, chocolate croissant was delicious.. overall, it was a good experience! The atmosphere was nice too. It was crowded, but wasn't too loud like some coffee shops.. and the fireplace in the back of the room is a nice cozy touch.",
  "Monk and Mongoose is where it's at! There aren't a ton of non-chain, more local type coffee shops in the DTC, but Monk and Mongoose is all you really need. Their lattes are amazing\u2014smooth, rich, and creamy. I went out on a whim the other day and tried their seasonal cranberry mocha. I don't typically like sweet coffee drinks, but this was the perfect balance of flavor and sweetness. The cranberry, chocolate, and espresso paired well together. I would describe this flavor combination as exotic. It was absolutely delicious and I wish it wasn't seasonal.",
  "Upon entering the facility I was impressed and flabbergasted by the amazing staff.  They were extremely helpful and charming. As an avid coffee consuming nomad I would say mark this on the map. 5$ gets you a very nice mocha. BRAVO",
  "For coffee enthusiasts who love the taste and smell of the coffee itself. If you're looking for a Starbucks feel, it's not necessarily for you, but there is a little bit of \"create your own\"&\"mix and match here\". I absolutely love it and recommend it highly!"

The staff always exudes positivity and professionalism.  The services rendered are above reproach, and will leave you feeling satisfied and confident.  You deserve this... make an appointment and head over there today!",
  "This place was amazing! I tend to put everyone before me, so I wanted to treat myself. It was absolutely well worth it. I went in there feeling so run down, and left rejuvenated. Tony did an outstanding job, he made me feel welcome; like I was at home with family and friends.",
  "Great staff and service, every visit. The ladies behind the bar are incredibly nice and very good at what they do. Everyone greets you and seems to really like working there, which is saying a lot these days.\n\nAs far as the barber and styling services, it's pricey but you get what you pay for here. I couldn't recommend Jen enough, as she's been my stylist for over 7 years now, and I'm sure the other barbers and stylists are also very good. \n\nCan't recommend this place enough!",
  "Killer cuts, killer drinks. Macy cut my hair and did an amazing job. Loved the experience.",
  "Amanda is the best stylist there by FAR! Everyone there including the bartenders and receptionists are so nice and professional. I never thought I would want to go hang out and have a drink while I get my haircut, but THIS PLACE is amazing! Worth every penny! Amanda knows how to cut my hair better than anyone I've ever gone to before."

The size of the place is appealing as well, being larger it looks like it would be less likely to have massive waits like other breakfast places. Very affordable, averaged about $12/ea. Will definitely be coming back!",

  "This is my go to breakfast place when I am in Colorado. \n\nWhen you walk in the feel is just right for a delicious breakfast, a jolt of coffee, and a good start to the day. \n\nTheir menu is solid and has a good range of breakfast choices that don\u2019t break the bank. They also have a lot of gluten free options and my dad who can\u2019t eat gluten much anymore loves their GF pancakes and waffles. \n\nRecently have been exploring their omelette and they do not disappoint.\n\nWhat is your favorite breakfast meal? \n\nIn short I would recommending you try the breakfast here and see if you also think it is eggceptional!?",

  "Quiet, small park located on the SW corner of E. Prentice Ave. and S. Valentia Way, between Prentice Place Lofts and Ricca Design Studio.  Includes a pagoda, a few benches, and nice tree cover.  This park is in named for and in dedication to James Peter (Pete) Lindsay.  Situated there is a centrally located placard placed in memoriam to him.  According to the placard, Pete Lindsay played an integral part in the development of DTC as a board member of the Goldsmith Metropolitan District.  His work was instrumental, affecting not just DTC's building architecture, but also its landscape and extensive parks.  \n\nI won't lie, this location is somewhat hidden/obscured by all the buildings around it and is close to the intersection of a couple main veins in DTC.  It is very small in size and not clearly defined.  If I hadn't seen the dedication, I would have just as easily thought of this as \"the landscaping area between two buildings\".  I found this place by accident or at least by happenstance. \n\nHowever, I felt it absolutely necessary to add this location to Google Maps.  DTC is a staple of prosperity, growth, and architectural aesthetics in the greater Denver Metro area.  This small park deserves to be noticed; it is part of a greater, grander system of parks and landscaping that defines the beauty of the area.  \n\nHere on a summer day I imagine it would be nice to gaze at the sky at sunset, as hues of gold wash over the clouds and reflect off the surrounding buildings.  A happy accident.  Thank you, Mr. Lindsay."

The Mac was disappointing, but the beans, corn bread and wedges were awesome.   Also have a pretty good beer selection on draught.   Reason for 4 stars, our food was Luke warm at best and they were out of fries, brownies, burnt ends and wings.  Would surely return, just hope food will be hot.

  "I\u2019ve been coming here since the day they opened with no complaints. They are the only place I\u2019ve been able to find good spicy green chili and a great burrito. The owner and her family are amazing I 200% recommended this place.",
  "First time visiting but I was very impressed with this place. Friendly, clean, comfortable. I ordered a breakfast burrito smothered and was delicious!! Watch out for the hot. They finish the burrito on a panini press which puts it over the top. I will be back!",
  "I've driven by this place a million times.  Finally went in for breakfast burritos this morning and they were pretty good!  Comparable burritos at other places cost double the price.  It was an inexpensive, filling, tasty breakfast.",
  "This place is amazing the owner always says hi to my kids,my husband and I, \nMost Mexican food in Colorado isn't very good but I love the food it's the best I've had in a restaurant here in Colorado.",
  "The food is pretty good. Not huge portions but very filling. The green chili is very good. The only downside is that the restaurant is on the small side. It can make you feel rushed to eat when you see a line forming at the door without any seats available."

  "Its small but great place to bring the kiddos.",
  "Nice little space close to home to get outside with the kids. Basic gravel playground with see-saw and swings. Lots of open grassy area to kick a ball around.",
  "Small park with a nice field and a bike path. Backing up to smoky hill, the traffic is sort of loud. The park has a pokestop and gym if anyone cares anymore, but it's pretty small, as far as the playground goes. Nice place for little kids. There is no parking, but you can park in the street behind the park. Not much entertainment, but it's not usually busy and it's got a book box. I'd recommend it to people with kids around 5 years old.",
  "Good place to walk.",
  "Dog friendly, large open fiels and a nice playground for youngins"

  "Used to be good. Now missing items and wrong burger orders. Been disappointed enough by this location. Don\u2019t waste your time.",
  "This place used to be good. Now it's not. Everytime I go there, there's some sort of issue, whether it's drive thru being incredibly slow, my order getting messed up, or my shake taking 15 minutes to get carried out, causing it to be melted. I really don't mind driving the extra few miles to go to a Sonic just to avoid this one even if this one is only a mile away from my house",
  "\"let's create the tightest drive through ever and then put lamp posts and rocks all along the sides so that people have a hard time getting through. that'll be great...\"",
  "My boyfriend and I were so excited to see a sonic, as we don\u2019t have any in the Seattle area. We stopped in and pulled into the stall, as we have always done, and waited. And waited. Finally, someone came on and said they would only help us if we came through the drive thru. Not a problem, but why still have the stalls set up if you aren\u2019t going to service them? They weren\u2019t busy, it was likely just inconvenient for her, as I saw her go out to another car while we were sitting in the stall eating.",
  "Big tasty portions at lightning speed. Drive-in location, so no bathroom or dining area or even register. Good deals: half price iced drinks 2-4pm, chicken, burgers Tuesdays and Thursdays. Great experience if you already like Sonic like me, and my wife's first time which she also enjoyed. Will go again."

  "remodeled inside now and has a few new employees.  Has ruffles and doritos usually along with arizona iced tea and sometimes slim jims.  Planters peanut sections and postachios, milk, and maybe a hot dog rack if you're lucky (don't remember).  It also has some sort of soda/slurpy machine I never use.",

  "Love the Pizzas as always but my wife did an online order for me to pick up and they neglected to give me her salad after I tried to verify I got everything...probably wont be back to this location.",
  "We keep getting pizzas whose tray burns and our house is filled with smoke as a consequence. They need to fix this before we decide not to order from them any longer.",
  "This was my first time trying Papa Murphy's and probably my last. For having to cook the pizza myself it was way over priced. I payed $23 for 2 medium pizzas. One with no toppings and the other with two toppings. I would guess that this cost them maybe $4. That is a huge profit in which they don't put back into their ingredients.  It was just okay.",
  "First when I called in the music in the background was so loud the person couldn\u2019t hear me. I told him he might want to turn down his music. \nThe person working the phones was not  competent. I placed an online order at the wrong Smokey Hill location. First he said it would take 5 minutes to find my order, the. When I said it was the wrong location he said he didn\u2019t know how to reverse the charges for on-line orders. Really!!! Train your people better.",
  "Very busy place tonight! The staff were amazingly kind, incredibly professional, and working ever so fast! Papa Murphy's should be very proud of their staff at their Smoky Hill location! The food was so good! Well done!"
