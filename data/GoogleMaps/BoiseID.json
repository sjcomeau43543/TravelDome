   "In spring the flowers are in bloom everywhere.  Definitely a place to go for a simple date to walk and talk.  If photography is your thing there are many different types of flowers you can take pictures of.  My favorite though is winter when everything is lit up with millions of Christmas lights.  The people are friendly the line to get in is reasonable and it just looks amazing.",
   "Good family fun! I always get my entire family together for our traditional walk through the Winter Garden Aglow. What a treat to find some talented young people spinning fire set to music, with a yuletide theme! That was our favorite part this year. We love the musicians who played carols down below, as well.",
   "The Gardens light displays were absolutely beautiful.  They do a fantastic job using all of the space to create an amazing family friendly place to take in the beauty of the Christmas season.  Traffic gets pretty crazy so I highly recommend going earlier than later.  They also do a great job of having drinks for both little kids and big kids.",
   "No matter what season you come it's always beautiful.  On this particular occasion it was during the winter and I went to the Winter Garden aglow event.  The lights were absolutely impressive and it was just staggering to me the sheer amount of work that must have got into making this event as amazing as it was.  I give definite kudos to all the volunteers who were willing to stand out in the cold to make a real difference to the people who came.  Thanks!",
   "I always love the Idaho Botanical Gardens! Whether it's Winter Garden Aglow, music in the gardens, or a good friend's wedding, the Botanical Gardens are the perfect spot to hang out. Beautiful. Calming. Refreshing. Worth checking out."

   "This is a very informative and interesting museum. I found it very sad, but it is pretty cool to see how differently prisoners were treated, and how much our current prisons have improved. It is a great place to take people of all ages, if a place is for older people, they will advise you against bring kids there. The staff is very responsible. My over all favorite part of this was seeing Dennis the Cat's grave. It is so sweet that there was a cat for people to love! I would definitely go here again!",
   "My Wife and I did the guided tour here and it was Awesome! So much history for Boise and so many stories we got to hear. The architecture within the walls was amazing and to hear the back story made the tour all come together. If you are looking for a fun and informative activity go check out The Old State Pen.",
   "This was a surprisingly awesome stop in Boise. We have been to Alcatraz and other places like this, but really appreciated the openness of our experience, as well as an amazing arms museum donated by J Curtis Earl. This happens to be one of the nation\u2019s largest collections of historic arms and military memorabilia, so WELL worth the visit!!\n\nPlan to spend 2hrs for a quick visit.. but we would recommend planning for a four (4) hour stop here. Plenty to see!!",
   "Neat to see a piece of history. Traveling exhibit of weapons when we went was really neat to see all in one place. Would have received more stars if more access to buildings was available. But what was open to the public was fun to see!",
   "Loved this self guided tour. Walked around for three hours.  Thinking wondering what 10 years would feel like in such a place.  The sad life there day after day. Crazy sad.  Put live in a different perspective for a few hours. \n\nThe arms museum was awesome.  Worth the moony even if your not interested in the prison.  And stories."

   "Coming from Dallas & having memberships to both the Dallas and Ft. Worth zoos was a bit of a shock, but now that it's our zoo, we love Zoo Boise. The expansion with the African exhibit is fantastic. I wish they would've sprung for non-reflective glass, but otherwise very well done. My kids love the zoo and we go a few times a month. We especially like when the keepers or student volunteers are out and give us a little extra information. My kids also love feeding the giraffes and the Sloth Bear. Can't wait to see the continued improvements.",
   "My family had an absolutely fantastic time at the zoo. It's so big and the enclosures are all so so so nice. There are inside and outside ones when it's cold and the prices are AWESOME!!! They have season passes that my family will definitely be getting. There's also an area that's fantastic for kids with a little play area and what not. Great for adults and kids",
   "An INCREDIBLE PLACE TO BE. NATURE NEVER LOOKED SO AWESOME! Stare into the snow leopards eyes if you dare! You'll FEEL the wild side and KNOW you WILL NEVER compete. Her tail the longest of ANY big cat and the FOX WOLF, really can read your mind. If you are starving, the Pretzels with cheese by the merry-go-round ROCK!",
   "This zoo has some really cool features but I'm pretty disgusted at the size of some of their exhibits. Instead of working on additions, they ought to be working on giving more space to some of their prisoners.  Sorry, not sorry. Do better, Zoo Boise. Compassion over profits, please. Some of your souls look so sad. Please give them more room and enrichment.",
   "Me and my wife had a good time at the zoo. I think the price is reasonable for how many animals and exhibits they have. It would be nice if some of the exhibits were a little more presentable but not that big of a deal."

   "Dog park was pretty good. Aside from nowhere to get water besides poopie water in the ponds. So bring your own clean water for your dog(s). Only super negative was the homeless drinking a case of beer outside the dog park area and the drug deal I witnessed but hey welcome to Boise"

There\u2019s also some trails tucked behind that is fun to do if you\u2019re looking for a nice stroll in the hills.",

   "Boise is the City of Trees, but you don't really notice it unless you climb up into the foothills and look out over the city. It's there that you realize, \"Oh, I guess we really do live in a forest.\" Camel's Back is a wonderful place to do that. Don't be daunted by the sheer straight face climb. There's also a much easier route to the top around the side. The park itself is also beautiful, idyllic.",
   "A nice destination in a fun part of Boise. We went up the steep side of the hill first and then along the ridge, finally finding our way back to the main part of the park along a less steep route. After exploring the park itself, we went around the base of the hill to the other side to walk into Hull's Gulch. A short walk that day, but we'll be back!"

I enjoyed being able to touch the rays and feed them. The staff is very knowledgeable and is happy to answer questions. Though small, this aquarium is perfect for a small adventure.",
   "Giving three stars because my daughter had a great time, but the staff didn't tell us a few things that they should have. They didn't  tell us that we had to buy the food at the front desk so we were walking around for a while wondering where to but it. Would have been nice if they just told us that if we wanted to feed them to just buy it then instead of going back to the front. Apparently paying with cash is cheaper, we only know this after coming back to buy the food and someone was paying to get in with cash and they said, \"since you're paying with cash you saved..\" Its quite small and not a lot to see but it was decent.",
   "This is such a great place to take kids. They have a very safe setup where even little kids can see and (where allowed) touch fish and rays. Very interactive and entertaining.",

New exhibits with legos and new tech are fun and interactive.  Birthday party setup is nice and allows for private access to the facilities for an hour or so.  Liquid nitrogen ice cream is pretty good as well!",

   "We had our organization's winter celebration at the Discovery Center for about 100 people, and it went great! Not only did all of the guests have a great time, Cynthia (the event coordinator), went above and beyond to make sure our event was a success. She helped coordinate with the many vendors that we had at the event, as well as met with me several times leading up to the event to make sure we had everything we needed.

   "A really nicely laid out outdoor memorial with beautiful stone work and paths, located right next to the Boise River and near downtown Boise. The memorial has many quotes from various civil rights leaders that sort of jump out at you as you walk through the memorial. Also includes a central statue of Anne Frank, imagery of other civil rights leaders and icons, and a memorial for historical genocides. However, it was unfortunate that all of the various civil rights leaders and movements were represented, EXCEPT any mention of the LGBTQ civil rights struggle or any mention of Stonewall or Harvey Milk. It seems this needs to be added, as it was conspicuously left out. It didn't seem complete to me.",

   "10 years ago Settlers park was the best park, with a huge variety. But over the years with the hot summer sun, everything now just looks faded. The large play area for some reason has a back entrance to it, so if you are standing on the ground while your child is on the play equipment, and they suddenly run towards the back entrance, you have to go ALL the way around the equipment to get them. Just seems poorly designed. \n\nIt's also almost always super crowded. To the point of annoyance. I understand public parks are popular, and never expect the park to myself. But it just always seems like there's a lack of parking and too many kids playing to keep a good eye on my multiple kids."

   "Absolutely fantastic experience from the moment I called with questions to the moment we left,  great staff. Very fun time in our escape room and I\u2019ve done escape rooms before. I will definitely be going back!! Our daughter had her birthday here as well and had a great time with her friends.",
   "The puzzles were extremely challenging and lots of fun. It was worth flying across the country just to play the game.  Finishing with 4 minutes left made us all feel proud!\nGreat facility- very nice \u201cguide.\u201d",
   "This was my first experience with an escape room and it was so different from what I had expected! I was thinking it would be some low budget not so scary spook alley with a couple puzzles. But it was very tastefully done with super thought provoking puzzles all relating to a central theme which in our case was ancient Chinese mysticism. And high quality, high tech props. Katelyn was really great and made sure to keep an eye on us through cameras, and if we got stuck she put up helpful hints on the TV screen in the room. It cost $25 per person and you have one hour to complete all the puzzles relating to one large puzzle. It was a lot of fun and I would recommend it to anyone!"

   "A great example of a state prison.  A very informative tour laid out with videos and interpretive signs. You can walk all around this prison from the general population halls, Siberia, the isolation cells to the hanging room. It is very sobering as you peak into the past. There are some beautifully tended gardens on the grounds as well as a  building that is just weaponry from the past. There are interactive features of your tour to enjoy as well.",
   "The remodeled museum is an absolute masterpiece! It is highly interactive and built in rooms that make it easy to manage groups of children. I went with a group of 4th graders and they were entertained for 2 hours. I felt proudly that it greatly represents our amazing state. It will easily impress visitors and locals. A must see!",
   "High quality museum and staff! I was greeted by Alyson (with a Y, she said), she was super welcoming and kind, she stood up to greet us. She engaged with my kids making sure they felt important. As a leader in customer service for over 15 years, I recognize good service. Alyson has it. \nThis museum is excellent! My kids loved the interaction aspect of the place. TownBoom was so fun! My kids loved the dynamics of the train.  Will visit again.",
   "It was a fun place for our whole family. There was a decent amount to see and do and our young kids were fairly well entertained the whole time. There were kids educational play areas which worked well for us and still deeper content for adults. There is a good mix of digital presentations and traditional displays.",
   "So much information, I suggest going for a good 5 hours to appreciate everything they have there \ud83d\udc9a I missed out on 1 large room and I was there a good 3.5 hours trying to read as much as possible. They include a lot of different topics and one room changes periodically. There are MANY hands on interactive things to do for children or people like me who love touching things \ud83e\udd23"

It was a little tough to see with the reflection on the water, but thankfully the sturgeon were hanging out at the contrasting white sand bottom, they were maybe between 4-6 feet long. Quite impressive! Thanks for creating such a great space, and its is free to visit!",
   "It's been several years since I'd been here. (No longer have little kids.) My husband and I had decided to go here in order to get a little walking in. They've really cleaned it up. They spruced up all the viewing areas. There's local art and several fun little kid activities. People of all ages were enjoying the spring day. I want to go back when it is really spring so that I can see what it's like with the butterflies and hummingbirds.",
   "Just for everyone's info, the nature center building is closed for remodeling for the next couple of weeks. You can still take the walk on the nature trail, which I recommend. It is amazing.

Lots of beautifully mature trees, diving ducks, and fisherman on the east side provided a wonderful backdrop for the day. Very clear water that you can wade across, but there is a swift current here. Great just for a picnic. Lots of dogs. A great mix of sun and shade, so that you can cool down a bit when necessary.",
   "If you are FLOATING THE BOISE RIVER this is the spot to launch your rafts. There are air hoses conveniently located by the launch spot and there is an outfitter with raft/tube rentals available as well. A snack shack with drinks, shaved ice and food is usually open during daylight ours as well. There is also a series of trails, both paved (bicycles, strollers) and dirt for exploring the park. I found a beautiful dock to view the river and watch the floaters coming down. I will be bringing family and friends to this spot and floating the river as well!"

   "This area known as Hyde Park is a historic, old shopping area which is been renovated into restaurants. There are a few very nice little stores which typically sell more unique items. There are various shops like:  ice cream shop, pizza places, bars, Mexican food, gas station which sells groulers, breakfast places, and several good restaurants. It is very walking friendly and dog friendly.  Several places to park with one area with pay parking.  It is a short walk to Camel's back park.  It is located in the historic north end of Boise.",
   "Nice to look at the houses, but the rumours are not true. THEY DO NOT GIVE OUT FULL SIZE CANDY BARS! It is ALOT of walking, LONG lines to wait in at EVERY house, and definitely a one and done kind of experience.  Been there, done that, dont need to do it again. Plus there are TONS of people, it is hard to walk on the sidewalk, if you have a stroller you are walking in the street which means whoever is pushing the stroller cannot be with the kiddos. Thankfully the street is closed to vehicles.",

Coach slope is great for beginners and cheap skiing.  Night ski slopes are well lit and fun.  All of this within a half hour from Boise.  Don't forget to get up there for mountain biking in the summer which is equally amazing!",
   "I love this place. I know people knock it because the road is sketchy at times and it can get crowded. Bring the appropriate vehicle or take the shuttle, and avoid midday on the weekends and you'll be fine.  The Bogus basin staff is always helpful and courteous. They run two of their own snow plows to keep the road clear. They have added many enhancements the last couple of years. It's a pretty great place that's only 16 miles from downtown Boise."

There are samples of many types of rock and mineral. Many exhibits are hands-on. There are things for both adults and kids. The staff are knowledgeable and very friendly. The day we went, there was no entrance fee, but we left a small donation, the museum is that good. There is a small gift shop. Note for wheelchairs and those with a fall risk: due to the age of the building, the floors are not always even. The ramps and lips and steps are marked."

   "I'll be honest with you, I'm not a wine guy, but I love literally everything about this place. (1) Even for a guy who doesn't love wine, their stuff is outstanding. (2) The people who run it are OUTSTANDING. They're a couple of scientists who moved to Idaho after giving up really successful careers to do what they love and give their kids a childhood that included following your pipe dreams and working with your hands. What's not to love about that? (3) Arguably most importantly, having a drink on the back patio in the last lazy hours of a summer day, with the background babble of the river and chatter of people who know how good they have it at that moment, surrounded by good friends and drinking vino even a wine-sceptic can love, there is no better more comfortable environment in Boise. Hats off to the folks at Telaya.",
   "Having been coming here about as long as Telaya has been open here it's absolutely the best place alone the greenbelt for wine and great conversation. The staff has always been the best.",
   "What a wonderful place that made our day on a beautiful fall weekend walk.\nThe welcoming fire and heaters on the cozy yet spacious patio were an irresistible magnet drawing us in for an equally warm welcome by some of the nicest people ever. Loved the wines, hospitality, and the ambiance. A must stop and linger place for those seeking great wine and great service.",
   "Great Wines and friendly people. This winery is so good. The location is amazing as well as their wines. Carrie and Earl, the winemakers, know what they are doing. This winery is located by a few other wineries so it makes a fun wine tasting day.",
   "As if procured from the legendary Icelandic mj\u00f3lkurvatn springs themselves, this was undoubtedly the best aquatic experience of my trip, and it's only my first day!  Smooth entry to a bold finish that tickled the sinuses, the Telaya wine was a treat, but the water was dessert. 12/10 would hydrate."

The rest of the park is nice where you can walk around it and there were people fishing in the pond.",

   "Delicious traditional wine. GREAT STAFF. A lil bit expensive on bottle prices. But overall a great place to visit. Don't forget to buy a growler on the way out the door so you can come back and drink some of their wines that are on tap. Unfortunately if you have a growler from another Winery they won't fill it because it's not one of theirs.",

Can\u2019t wait to go back for another session of wine tasting here. The place looks great with chill vibes. We will be back soon! Thank you!",
   "Very relaxing place to wine taste. Open area can fit quite a bit people inside while not feeling close to each other. Wines are also really good. Not a red wine fan but tried a few here and ended up tasting quite good. The sweet wine is also really good."

   "Amazing workers and beautiful art. However, calling themselves \"wheelchair accessible\" feels like a massive joke. Their ramps are so steep my chair almost tipped over every single time I went up.They had a seperate ramp to reach each exhibit. It seemed silly, because 90% of the gallery was flat, or flat enough- minus one-three single small steps. There's no reason to block off accessibility. Such a small fix. There was a lot of ramps and a lot of \"legally passing\" wheelchair accessibility, but zero *real* accessibility. I'm amazing I didn't tip backwards and crack my head open. I truthfully hope this gets fixed.",
   "Beautiful art. Not exactly my cup of tea but I still enjoyed my visit.",
   "This museum is in an area that includes other attractions, the river, a park, and you can walk from here to some of the downtown restaurants and stores. But the museum itself is very nice. We had to pay less than $10 for two of us and it was a bargain. There was a temporary exhibit of contemporary art and galleries for several other art areas. Local artists as well as nationally known. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. This is not a large museum, but it is very efficient and easy to follow through to the various exhibits.",

   "This is a wonderful public park right in the heart of West Valley. There's a nice paved loop that follows the perimeter of the park, as well as a children's playground. There's this big duck pond in the back corner where there are as many as 50-100 ducks and geese. There's usually enough parking and there's a portapotty in case nature calls while you're in nature. Really nice park, I definitely recommend stopping by here if you're in the area.",

I have sunken into the rut (I never intend to leave) of Old Fashions. They use quality ingredients and (I believe) a rye whiskey. This is the secret to good Old Fashions for the discerning: rye whiskey. Pair off this with guacamole and you have yourself a date!",
   "One of my favorite local restaurants. Truly one of the gems of Boise Idaho. Incredible atmosphere. Wild and unique art. Top notch food. My personal favorite is the hot rock fillet. The cognac cream sauce is just to die for. They have a great private dining space for large groups or business gatherings. Highly recommend. ( Side note: They do a buffet for Thanksgiving dinner that is out of this world.)",
   "What a unique experience. I don't think I've ever seen a place with more unique decor. Very eclectic. And really terrific food as well. Very original presentations. And you have to try the guacamole"

   "The food was delicious!  Our server was polite and was very efficient.  We had so much fun.  Each of our dishes came out exactly how we wanted.  I highly recommend the Glazed Brussel Sprouts and the Asparagus Fries.",
   "Excellent food and nice atmosphere. Staff was friendly and took great care of us. Had the tacos for an appetizer and they were amazing! Had a Cuban sandwich as my boyfriend got a burger, both very good. Had to save room for dessert and got the bread pudding and it was one of the best desserts I\u2019ve ever had! Warm bread pudding with ice cream... delicious!",
   "Went downtown for coffee and dessert.  The coffee was the best!!!\nWe had the huckleberry ice cream and the caramel swirl ice cream. The 3rd dessert was enough for 3: a large brownie, 2 or 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream.  The restaurant is in an old building that has been elegantly renovated. The restaurant was busy on Saturday night, but we were seated promptly.  Would definitely return when visiting Boise, ID again!",
   "Absolutely great place. Love each dish. The flavors are real good. This is the best in Boise, Idaho area. We loved how family friendly it was. We have children and they gave coloring pages as well as activity sticks to mend. Our favorite is wine braised beef with mashed potatoes- the best dish and incredible flavor. Awesome place to celebrate a life event. Thank you Fork!",
   "Dining experiences like this are few and far between. We had tempered our expectations due to a local barista telling us that Fork \"wasn't as good as it claims to be\". You walk in to wood and brick tones coupled with decor that immediately gives you the impression that you'll be paying $40 per person, then you open the menu and are pleasantly surprised to find very reasonable prices with the most costly brunch plate being just under $14. I had the Chef's Benny, an amazing take on Eggs Benedict. The poached eggs were perfect spheres and the yolk spilled out in perfect creamy splendor. My best friend gave me a piece of his bacon and I immediately ordered a side of it. Candied cayenne bacon is now the only way I'm going to make bacon. Then there was our server, Erica. Aside from having an amazing smile, she was friendly and just the right amount of attentive to not be overbearing but make sure we weren't neglected. Overall, this five-star experience actually makes me disappointed that I don't live in Boise so I can come back and try everything else on the menu over time. Thank you Erica and Fork for the phenomenal brunch!"

   "This place is literally the best place in Boise. The combinations of flavors and quality of food amazes me Everytime. I usually get the entrees rather than the pasta here and I have been impressed each time. My significant other usually gets the pasta and he has given just as much praise. The service here is also so caring and welcoming, it makes me just want to hang out there longer. The drinks are quite delicious too. If your a foodie and love great service, defiantly go here. They show a lot of creativity, care, and quality in their food, service, and atmosphere.",
   "The mussels were outstanding. The gluten free pasta in my seafood dish was not cooked well; however it was loaded with seafood, which made up for it. Nice atmosphere and good service. I would go back.",
   "Consistently great service and food. There are plenty of gluten free options if needed. The portions are normal sized. Wonderful flavors; you want to savor these bites! The decor and ambiance are also unique and attractive. Nice that you can see the whole team of employees working together well.",
   "Fantastic service and excellent food plus a suave, romantic ambiance. Entire staff was very friendly and attentive, clearing plates and filling water quickly, checking to make sure we didn't need anything else.  Food was outstanding, from the winter citrus & arancini appetizers to the fresh-made pasta.  Cocktails also excellent, especially the smoked cocktail that comes in an inverted glass filled with smoke from a scorched piece of wood.",
   "Tonight was an amazing first experience at ALAVITA with my hubby!! The staff was very professional, informative about their menu, and super friendly!! You can taste the passion that goes into their food and the flavors just sing in your mouth!! We will definitely be coming back for sure!!"

High quality containers, bread & all the butters, bags packed so the dinners arrive intact & beautifully presented!  PLUS, timing is perfect!   Cold food was still cold, hot food was still hot.  Of course, every morsel was delicious!  Congratulation to everyone for you ability to overcome obstacles & delivery what everyone expects!  The best dining experience in Boise!",
   "What's great here? The music and the service. The food is a bit hit or miss, which can be disappointing as prices are high. Wine list is impressive but hard to actually use. Cocktails are good. List of wines by the glass is only okay. \n\nI like to support live music. I appreciate that they have live bands here.",
   "Fabulous...everything was perfect! From the host to everyone we encountered. Food was made to perfection and the drinks were the best I've ordered from a restaurant. \nAbsolutely recommended",
   "It's beautiful and the music enjoyable. The service was outstanding and the Wagyu/Angus steak was the best steak I've had in my entire life, worth the money, cooked perfectly. Our servers were Wesley and Clayton and they were on top of all our needs all evening, informative, kind, cheerful, and professional. Our server in the lounge before dinner was a lovely young lady with a lot of energy and interest and when they were out of the wine I chose, she returned with an informative second choice suggestion for me. Everything about Chandler's is classy and high quality and delivers an unforgettable experience. Thank you, Chandler's for making our little celebration special!",
   "I don't think a review on this place is necessary but I'll do it anyway. We sat at the bar early ,place packs fast do make reservations or be there at 4. Service was impecable and food was great. Typical great American steak house. No fancy stuff. Great steaks, great crab, great wine and scotch , great service. A must"

The menu has exceptional variety and we\u2019ll return for dinner the next time we\u2019re here.",
   "Great atmosphere to get drinks after work, weekends, etc. Food is excellent, fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. Cheese board appetizer is the best! The pairings are spot on and intrigue your mouth. Not very accommodating for business lunch (tables are tiny).  Friendly and knowledgeable staff, Brei was so nice!",
   "Attentive friendly staff. I love their Bruschetta. Their kids meals are full meals. But it's more of a bar setting so having kiddos there feels a little awkward. Other than that it food was tasty and drinks are good.",
   "Bardenay is one of our favorite downtown dining experiences. We like coming down for a drink and food when we can. Happy hour is great, just make sure to get here before 6PM. They have great vegan/vegetarian options. I highly recommend the sweet potato chimichanga. Parking can be tricky at times, it might be best to park in the parking garage above the Egyptian Theater.",

However, we waited over 40 minutes for the main courses and didn't see our server again for 20 minutes after he dropped the food. He didn't even check back with us to see how everything came out. Overall, food was great but not sure it was worth the wait.",

Shrimp, chicken and sausage in a spicy cream sauce over four cheese ravioli,  I would recommend it but be aware it is a bit spicy.   We were with a fairly large group and everyone had a fantastic time.  Though it is not cheap it is worth it!!!",
   "Finally had the chance to go here for my birthday back in February. This place lives up to their reputation! Food was phenomenal,  service was 5 star! Wish I could remember my servers name bc she was great. Hope to come back soon and try some other dishes!",
   "Luciano's in easily one of the best Italian restaurants in Boise. Everything I have had here is good and the service is excellent. The only thing that drives me crazy is the wait time to get your food. These guys are slow! But their food is really good and the price is decent as well. They also have really good bread for you to snack on during the eternity it takes to get your food.",
   "This place is very very friendly for couples having a romantic atmosphere and being very very friendly for couples over 21. They have a wine bar in the waiting area, so while the wait may be long you can still enjoy yourself during the wait.  The chef specials are always delicious, which isn't a surprise as I've never been disappointed with any meals I've ever had here. There are some items on the menu that may be 1.5-2x as expensive as another Italian restaurant but with the food being 3x as good it is well WELL worth it. If you've never been somewhere like this before no worries the staff will be able to give you a laundry list of fantastic recommendations.  There is not one item on the menu that will disappoint and that is something yo uh can bet on. Given the price point the and the atmosphere I would not so much recommend this as a place to take children but not many places in the area can compete as a venue to celebrate an anniversary or other momentous occasion.  It's not a big chain, which for fine dining is very important as it ensures quality is consistent every single time you visit.",
   "Call ahead, or make reservations. We ended up waiting an hour to be seated, but it was worth it! The atmosphere is cozy and charming. It's a popular place, but on the smaller side, so there is usually a wait if you walk in. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waitress was Cassandra, and she was amazing. Our glasses were always full, she was friendly and accommodating, and she was a rather good salesperson. I usually don't get appetizers or dessert, but she convinced us to get both. The food was delicious and even though it was packed, they brought the food out in a timely manner. I can understand why they have many awards for Boise's best Italian. Picture perfect dining experience. We're definitely going back!"

They have a wide variety of menu items and everything that I have tried has been delicious. I totally recommend these guys, especially for happy hour!",
   "Generally pretty busy in the evening. Like all other restaurants in the area, parking is a task of it's own. Loved the burger and drinks selection.",
   "Friendly and fast service.  The food was fantastic and they had lots of options.  I was very impressed by their beer menu, with an awesome selection of beers from some of the best craft brewers all over the country.  Will definitely be coming back the next time I am in town.  Prices were reasonable as well.",
   "First time at Eureka. Excellent service by Kate. I tried the Lollipop Corndogs, and the Truffle Cheese Fries - both were well-prepared and tasted delicious. My wife thought the Hemp Bowl was absolutely wonderful - both because of the great taste and the emotional joy from eating healthy. Definitely try this place out.",
   "Eureka is one of my favorite places to go downtown. The appetizers are really unique and I haven't had one that I didn't like yet. The deviled eggs with horseradish are to die for and the firecracker sauce on the hot wings is out of this world. When you bring children they bring their food out first to make sure they aren't waiting too long. I have had a little trouble when ordering drinks that they seem to sit at the bar and the waitstaff forgets to bring it to your table for a long time so it just sits there - on more than one occasion,  however their drinks are to die for and are ALWAYS worth the wait. I have tried about half of the items on the menu and all of the appetizers and have only had one thing I didn't care for. The hemp bowl is my favorite entree, and my husband loves the jalapeno egg burger. It is worth going to try their food just because of all the different options they have that are exciting and so different than other restaurants.  Eureka is really something special."

Not knowing the culture or the type of foods to order, the waiter was a plus as he knew exactly what we should order and what we would find enjoyable. The experience was great.  \n\nAppetizers we had the Olive dip, the cheese dip and then this really good bacon sweet paradise dip that they made especially for that day, I think it contained goat cheese. Oh my goodness with the baguette it was wonderful.  For the main course. Braised pork loin you can see the picture it was topped with a great balsamic vinegar and it was delicious.  Bread was freshly baked.\n\nYou are missing out if you do not pop in here. I highly recommend this place.  Price is super reasonable",
   "The Basque Market is a great place to learn about the rich Basque culture of this area. We tried some Basque cuisine; the cheese croquettes were great! Back in 2009, The Basque Market held a function for our convention where they use a gigantic paella pan and cooked for hundreds of people! Apparently they do this at least once a week during the warmer seasons. This last time I was at the market I bought a Basque cookbook. I can't wait to try some recipes.",
   "Great place. Must visit. The meatballs were out of this world. Get two serves, trust me. The paella pockets were not great - a bit oily and claggy, but still tasty. The wine selection is very f good with a lot of interesting Basque and Spanish wines.",
   "Highly recommend this place. Coming to the basque market before flying out Boise, thus, we didn\u2019t know what to expect. Walked passed by this place to take a gamble and glad we did it as the food is delicious, and very reasonably priced too!",
   "This is a must stop on any visit to Boise. I usually come for the fresh made paella, currently served Wednesday and Friday at noon. You can watch it be prepared right outside the market. I would recommend coming at least a half hour in advance. Try their wine slushy sangria, topped with red wine, beware of brain freeze. If you come the last weekend in July there is a Basque festival. Live music, food and drinks. The market is small inside but there is seating outside."

   "I always mean to try something new, but after I tried the brisket salad, I've never changed to something else. Absolutely delicious!  They used to have a small or large portion, now it's just one size and seems to be just about right. Great service!",
   "Beef ribs and loaded mashed potatoes!! The food is always excellent and the prices aren't too high. It isn't a cheap place to eat but it is worth the money. They have some pretty great chicken fried steak too.",

The food was hot which is a big deal for me since alot of place serve lukewarm dishes. Our server was Jake and he took good care of us.

I will go back and looking forward to bringing friends for a lively debate over some delicious Idaho based food",
   "The food is mediocre. $24 for a sea bass, some bland rice and 8 green beans. My waitress was ok. I order a soup and salad for me, I said I will have a soup and salad, and she took off and didn't take my wife's appetizer order. When she came back I had to say that was just for me, my wife needs to order. She left and brought out our salad and didn't ask what we had wanted to order for our main course. When she brought our soup that's when I said can we order our main course.  The soup, French onion, was very watered down. I've had some very nice French onion soup and this was not very good at all. We won't be going back",
   "The food was really good! We sampled food from all areas of the menu and it was all delicious! Service was very helpful and friendly. Great birthday dinner! We'll be back \ud83d\ude0a",
   "Valentine's Day/Retirement special occasion dinner....Sat down right @ 5:00 reservation time. Seeing later tables being served, had to ask for a server @ 5:15 to get cocktails which were good. Got red balloon glasses for a chard. Server poured away, no tasting that $100 bottle. I ordered lamb chops, got the pork. Food presentation poor and food very salty. Second bad experience here, we're out.",

   "If you\u2019ve never experienced Tucanos before, it\u2019s time. I\u2019ve been to eat at a Tucanos dozens of times and I don\u2019t even live within 3 hours of one. The food is great. The service is great. Atmosphere is fun. It\u2019s all you can eat for a flat price. It\u2019s worth the trip.",
   "We were brought here by a company we do business with and I have to say the entire experience was amazing. Start off w the salad bar and let the servers bring you all sorts of meats. Simply delicious. Great service. Recipe for success.",
   "By far the better option between the different Brazilian grills in the Treasure Valley. Excellent variety on the salad bar including soups, pasta, and salads all of it very fresh! As for the meat selection, it is solid in variety and excellent in flavor! They do not have any lamb options which some may be disappointed to hear. Only reason for a star being knocked off is the last few times I've been in I've noticed that the size of the meat, fish, and vegatable served to me by each server is quite small which would be fine but the frequency at which the servers come by your table has also dropped...not enough that I won't be going back, yet.",
   "Angela was helpful on our first time there. She was very cautious and sweet and checking on us regularly. I super loved the energy from Levi the meat guy he was sweet and bubbly and looked as though he enjoyed his job. The manger of the store came by and checked on us. Super happy place.  Fully recommend also all there food was made fresh.  There variety of things to eat were incredible seriously all type of things",
   "It had been about 2 years since my wife and I had been to Tucanos. We decided to go on New Years Eve. When we checked in at the  front counter for our reservation, they informed me that the dinner pruce was $31.95 that night, not the regular $24.95. We were seated right away. And throughout the meal the service was very good. \n\nThe food was less than average though. Salad bar was nothing special at all - but the Lobster Bisque was pretty good. The wide variety of meat delivered on skewers was for the most part dry and kinda tasteless, some samples tough and chewy.  The meal that night did come with a piece of cheesecake which was OK. And, a nice touch, there were party favors on the tables to help celebrate the New Year. \n\nThis was not the way I remember the food. I loved the food before, not now."

Such a homey feeling and the hospitality was wonderful.",

The mixed board was very well priced and you get a lot to try and the other tapas are very reasonably priced. Didn't do drinks this time but it looked interesting.  Free wifi and nice outdoor area. Great addition to the Boise food scene.",

One of the waiters there was able to turn on some heaters and gave us blankets while he rearranged some tables inside for us so we could squeeze in. we were outside no more than 5 min, and were seated quickly, where it was warm! Great hospitality and even better drinks and food. totally recommend this spot!",
   "Very hip and inviting environment with counter service. Food was great with several different appetizers and dishes to choose from. Wine and coffee from around the world. Service was great with friendly knowledgeable staff. Well behaved kid friendly environment with a downtown location. Prices very reasonable. I will return anytime I'm in Boise."

Service was friendly and fast and the restaurant has a cozy vibe even though it is two stories and quite roomy. I had eggs Benedict and a waffle both of which were tasty. Lots of great and yummy choices on the menu. My husband had one of the skillet scrambles and our friend had chicken and biscuits which also tasted great.",
   "Delicious food and great craft cocktails. Must make a reservation on weekends for sure or you won\u2019t get a table. Some portion sizes can be a bit small, so order a few things and share. Love this place and will be back!",
   "BEST drinks in Boise. Go sit at the bar, order some drinks, people watch, talk to the bartenders, watch the weird things on the TV, order some food. This place has the best vibe in Boise. Upscale, but not arrogant. The bartenders make a fabulous drink selection of things you've never tried before--which seem  to be changed out seasonally. Each one is perfect, and beautiful, in it's own way. If you want something more intimate, head upstairs. If you're planning on dinner, make a reservation! (Don't forget to try the fries...Seriously! And stay for the dessert.) Plan to pay for the quality, it's worth it. (Shout out to Daniel and Chris--so nice, and made us feel like we belonged.)",
   "Always a lovely experience. I feel classy and special thanks to the waiters and cooks. The quality of food is phenomenal, and I'm always excited to try their new items",
   "Came for brunch, and our reservation was ready on time. I think we either hit an off or busy morning though, because even though we got seated, we weren't served right away, and several times found ourselves waiting for someone to come back and check up and/or take our order.  The food was amazing though, and I highly recommend the cheddar potato side (far superior to the crispy). There were also an impressive number of options for our vegetarian members. However, we ordered bingets, and then didn't get them until after the meal, when we reminded the waiter. But, they were on the house as an apology. Would definitely come back!"

I've never had purple fries and found them  to be really good. The crowd was kind of trendy when were in. It feels like the  type of place students would congregate to grab a bite and discuss assignments. It was quite expensive for what we are. Three burgers, fries, and a drink for three was $55 for three with a tip. We would visit again.",

But this is how I imagine it. \n\nI wish I lived in Boise, ID just so I could go here whenever I'm craving burgers and fries. Don't get me wrong, the menu extends beyond that, but the assortment of potato types (gold, russet, red, purple, etc) and cuts (home style, waffle, thin) make fries the bread and butter of this establishment. \n\nDid I mention the variety of dipping sauces? Do I need to? So good! I tried the blueberry aioli with purple fries and was blown away. The trays are designed to comfortably set three sauces onto them, something I appreciated. \n\nI was also a fan of the fountain drink selection. The machines had local lemonade and \"healthier\" soda options.",

The noodles were perfectly cooked and somewhat fries which gave it the best tasting crunch.",

The brussel sprouts starter was excellent.",

There was no way I was eating in an empty, cavernous room.  The maitre d' allowed us to grab some menus and sit at the lobby bar. The people at the bar were all there on business, forlornly sitting by themselves. The service behind the bar seemed college young and was pleasant enough, but there was a concrete lack of sophistication.\n\nPortions were huge, fit for a nose guard.  The short ribs and bison meat loaf were both monstrously good, as was the wedge salad.  I was just expecting high end, and a level of class that was not evident in the Grove Hotel.  I could have been in a sports bar in Fort Wayne, Indiana. With my expectations dashed, but my stomach full, we hurried back to the Inn at 500 Central on this bone chilling night."

   "My now fiance proposed to me here on New Years Eve this year and they were just so amazing. The food was delicious but they went above and beyond to help make it special and a secret from me. My sister and brother in law dressed up in ridiculous outfits to get pictures and after we had drinks near the bar. I was truly in awe of everything, the people here were so nice. We are highschool sweethearts and after 11 years this was just the perfect place for him to propose \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd70\u2764",
   "Brought my parents here for their 50th Anniversary. The food was amazing, Sea bass, Steak. Chicken all of it. Loved the French onion soup and the creme brule..\n  The appetizers were good, but the crackers seemed pretty generic. It could have used more meat and cheeses. Besides that it was great.  Loved the atmosphere.",
   "To be fair,  we only ordered dessert.   The staff was attentive and friendly.   The bread pudding was ok.   It seemed a little dry on top.   The bottom was delicious and moist.   The berry cobbler was good but more cobbler crust was desired.",
   "My husband had the elk for dinner. Amazingly good! Very flavorful but not \"gamey\"; tender and juicy. We also ordered the Morel Mushrooms from McCall. The morels were plentiful and tender, however, the brown sauce was too overpowering for my preference. I had the Pappardelle with Pesto and added sauteed shrimp. Absolutely fabulous. It had ribbons of zucchini and arugula which made it less heavy than a full pasta dinner. I had plenty left over. Lovely setting - cool and quiet inside at 5:00 pm.",
   "The restaurant is beautiful and romantic. I love the huge stone fire place! We were there Valentine's weekend and saw a proposal. As for the food, I wasn't impressed. This was our first time there and I did not enjoy my meal. I had the halibut and it was very greasy and I couldn't even finish it. My husband tasted it and said it was awful too. He, on the other hand, had the lamb shank and loved it. I'd be willing to try the restaurant again but I would definitely order something different."

   "We happen to come across this place when looking for a place to eat lunch on our last day in Boise back in February. We had just gotten hipster t-shirts with the image of the state of Idaho, with a long beard coming out of the bottom. This place seemed like the perfect place to go next. The beef brisket sandwich with blue cheese was good. Bob also enjoyed the burger he ordered. They have a good selection of craft beer as well.",
   "We had a slab of ribs, collard greens and cornbread. Really fantastic barbecue here. They had unbelievable smoky flavor and they were cooked to perfection. The top edges were a bit crispy and my friend wasn\u2019t sure about that aspect but I thought it was delicious.",
   "Came in on a Monday for lunch at 12:10pm, wasn\u2019t super crowded (4 tables of two), server was on top of it and we ordered quickly, food was slower (out at 12:40). \nPulled Pork Sandwich was hot and juicy. Almost too wet for the ciabatta bread. The BBQ sauce overpowers the taste of the meat, I would ask for it on the side and apply as needed. It\u2019s delicious and pairs well. Slaw was mild and the crunch the sandwich needed! \nFry sauce has a kick to it! My husband loved it I didn\u2019t, but the fries are good plain. \nOverall a good BBQ restaurant with a constantly changing menu.",
   "Food is delicious and the staff is super friendly! Love the fact that this restaurant was one of the first downtown to offer curbside to-go orders and likely the very first to offer any discount on all to-go orders several days before the Mayor of Boise shut down dine-in option for Boise restaurant. A true gem!",
   "IMO, The best food in Boise.  If you are a foodie, you must try the brisket and the drinks are amazing."

   "Looking for seafood or sushi in Boise? This is it. This place is fantastic. I have been here twice, and disappointment is the furthest thing from my mind. My last visit was a date night with my wife, and while there was a wait, it was worth it. This was by far one of the more enjoyable sit down meals I've had in awhile. Service, food, atmosphere was spot on. I will be visiting this business again.",
   "Absolutely incredible food firstly...\nHowever the environment is really what makes the experience amazing.\nI snapped a few photos my last visit the other day just for it's sheer beauty and size!\nIt's big enough to hold a conference in the back!\nThe original looking deck makes it feel like you are on a ship.\nAbsolutely awesome place and one of my favorites!\n10/10 (rare)",
   "Very tasty variety of food to eat! A bit noise near large groups but settled down when food arrived. Nice atmosphere and good staff. Had seared Ahi and Scallops and was very satisfied.",
   "Arrived for our 6:00pm dinner reservation and the hostess tried to seat us in the bar.  I looked in the dining area and there were two. vacant tables. I had to be insistent but got us seated in the dining area after a 20 minute wait. \n\nIf you're looking for a quiet place to eat with your family, this place isn't it. We wont be back because this isn't the first time we've  had issues with this place."

We didn't have to ask for anything. You listened, you offered your opinion, and girl you hit it on the head!! 10* PERFECT service!! We are extremely picky and normally wish we would have stayed home and cooked ourselves. The Tomahawk was so tender, beautifully cooked and seasoned, never had we eaten lobster with such flavor, the crab legs were also perfect,  then you finished us off with that sweet and gooey bread pudding!! Our Valentine dinner (a day late) was better than we could have dreamed!! To the Chef, Miss Jerri and management THANK YOU!!",
   "Went here for a work party and the food lived up to the price. I absolutely loved the tuna steaks! My wife enjoyed their Salmon burger.",
   "Let's just say this place is awesome!  For lunch I had  the club, simply the best.  My girlfriend had the BLT.  No one left hungry, unsatisfied, but we did leave with leftovers!  The servings are generous, not a complaint at all!  They still have the best charcuterie board in Boise, and it's not on the lunch menu but they will make it on request!  Thank you for being awesome!",
   "Great happy hour! \n\nThe halibut is a must! Phenomenal. The plating looks kinda orange but it is the best thing I\u2019ve tried at the Owyhee yet. \n\nLunch menu is very affordable and service is speedy. If you go to dinner during happy hour the service is rather slow. Not sure if they\u2019re understaffed or maybe someone didn\u2019t show, but the servers worked hard.",

Sign up for their fondue club and get coupons for free chocolate dipped strawberries and heads up about special events and dining opportunities. The choices are diverse, you'll definitely fine something you like; or just go for dessert! The staff are fun and engaging and can make suggestions if you gets stuck in all the choices.",
   "Everything was superb from the service of the kind wait staff to the food and the experience. Was the meal I just had worth almost $300 for two people? Not quite. Well the selection of dippable options is almost unending, The quality left something to be desired. For the same price there are steakhouses downtown that I would rather eat at.",
   "Wow, this place is the worst value for the money I have ever experienced. The portions are small, so be prepared to have a burger on the way home. The 30 bucks worth of meat you get arrives as 6 little cubes of 3 kinds of whatever you pick. But if you pick any of the flavored cooking methods, it all tastes the same. They even give you dipping sauces for the meat, which is a clear sign that it's a low cut of meat. It was an experience that I'm glad I don't have to repeat.",
   "We went the day after Valentine's Day, we were so excited to try this place. There were 4 of us so we had a table with two burners. We were not greeted by or sever for about 10 minutes after being seated, she then came by and took our drink order, it took about 15-20 minutes to get our drinks. Once we ordered and they brought the cheese out the server has to make each at the table, the first cheese took forever, then the second pot of cheese wasn't melting, we checked the burner and it wasn't on. She said it was unplugged, which is below the table on the wall by the floor, she had us, the guests, go below the table and plug it back in. The cheese chose took over 30 minutes before we could even eat it due to the slow cooking and slow server,i even offered top help stir the cheese pits for her as she was so slow ans we were tired of having the server stand at or table making small talk. We ordered another drink, the salads came, our drinks were still empty. Finally i found another server and asked for our drinks, the manager came over and apologized for the wait, said she is assigning  us a new server and that this round of drinks would be on them. We appreciated this. The new server was very nice and seemed much better than the first. We had now been there 2.5 hours when he brought out the pots for dinner. The food was great once we got it. It then seemed like we never saw our waiter again. He took our dessert order but by this time we had been there 3 hours and we had to get home to relieve the baby sitter. I asked to speak to the manager as we never saw the server again, he apologized for the wait and i said we just want to close out and get the dessert to go. He got us the dessert tip go and gave us $20 gift cards for our next time in. We will never be back after that. We arrived at 7:15pm and left at 1030pm.",

   "The vibe is great. I actually came here for a live show. It was great. Drinks are good. Great prices. Second time here was with my girlfriends for my bday food was so good. I also had the fish bowl drink and it was big and perfect for my bday.",
   "Food was great.  Had the nachos as an appetizer. They were amazing.  Nice cozy atmosphere. Voodoo fries are described as spicy.  Give them a try. They are super mild.  The steak tacos on the other hand do have a little spice",
   "Best place to see reggae bands in Boise.  Lots of high quality national bands roll through this place including some in the past who now headline Red Rocks (Stick Figure).  The food is great, staff is friendly, and the mojitos are amazing.  Plus a sweet rooftop tiki torch bar.",
   "Super fun atmosphere, amazing food. Forbidden nachos that are to die for! Our server, Nikki, was super attentive and helpful! Love the vibe and the live music! Would definitely recommend checking this place out.",
   "What a fun atmosphere filled with delicious food and drinks. The happy hour there is off the hook. We ordered the mondo pupu platter and were presently surprised at how much food we got.  We will definitely be back!!"

   "I LOVE this place!!! Incredible service, the food was freaking fantastic, the drinks... are still kinda with me...\nI traveled over 1600 miles to eat here & it was worth every step of the way!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",
   "I have diet restrictions as does my mother. We ordered simple pieces of grilled chicken (which I will add that they were tremendous); but to charge $25 dollars for a little piece? Not to mention say that they could\u2019ve fixed the problem AFTER they took my payment. Restaurant was fine and all, but not worth $25 to get a small piece of chicken again...sorry too overpriced guys.",
   "The food was good, the service very good...but...My wife ordered her steak well done.  I know chef's hate to prepare beef this way, but they are not the one who will eat nor pay for it.  Do what the customer requests.  Her steak was closer to what I'd call medium...still slightly red in the center.  Well done means brown throughout...no pink at all.",
   "Perfected classics with depth of flavor. Great salad bar and sourdough rolls too! The sirloin steak was juicy and highly recommended!",
   "This was my first time eating here and I had the 14 oz ribeye and the salad bar. I did like the chicken soup from the salad bar it was very good. The steak was very moist but lacked flavor. I had to put a lot of salt on it to enhance the steak. The lunch price for a 14 oz steak was $28 and dinner prices are a lot more. I felt for the price the flavor should have been a lot better for the steak. Also for the price there was really only one side. I paid $2.50 extra to have the salad bar. Otherwise my steak would have only come with either a salad or fries or soup. I think salad and a potato should be a standard side dish for these with no extra charge. $28 is more than enough to include those sides. A baked potato was an upcharge. I will try this place again and hopefully it's better next time.\n\nUPDATE: I went back and had the prime rib dinner and I really enjoyed it. It was so much better and had great flavor. It seems to be very popular. But they did a great job with the flavor. I will come back to have this meal again."

   "Wow! I have heard that the food here is really good so we decided to have dinner at this restaurant. We were not disappointed. The menu had a wide variety of scrumptious looking foods. It was difficult to narrow down the choices, everything sounded wonderful. Our server was great, she was friendly and accommodating. When the food arrived it looked and tasted fantastic, huge portions too. I find myself thinking about the good food and I plan to get back there soon. You should try it too.",
   "Andrade's \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\nThis Boise Mexican restaurant near the corner of Overland and Orchard has a far more complex menu than most. Despite a few glitches, KM and I enjoyed our meals so much on 7/21/19 that we may have to re-think our bias re: the best Mexican food is in Canyon County. Andrade's is planning to move to a new location on Overland Rd. that will double their floor space to over 6,300 sq. ft., hopefully in Dec. 2019. Both of our dishes came with seasoned potatoes that were so delicious, we each ordered two additional sides of potatoes to take home with us. The rice was an add-on. The salsa was excellent. Highly Recommended!!!",
   "They happily had my food ready faster than expected. Fast, friendly service at a very affordable price! The food was delicious! I will be going back again \ud83d\ude0a",
   "A great Mexican restaurant in the heart of Boise.  I had an enchilada combo that was perfection. 3 different types of enchiladas and a flauta. The chips and salsa was recognizably homemade and delicious.  The desserts were sweet and delicious.  Many choices of beers and wines as well.",
   "This was my first time dining at this restaurant. The atmosphere was very inviting, friendly staff and employees would come check on us regularly to make sure we were ok with the drinks and as well when we got our food. Everything was delicious and the portions were plentiful. I would recommend this place and I will be returning to try some different stuff. The only thing that was a little frustrating was the time it took to get one of our drinks,  for mine was about 10 min and for my friend was a good 15 or so. Really didnt have time to enjoy them before the food came. All in all a very nice restaurant"

Got a couple of mixed drinks that were great with brunch.  You really can't go wrong here.  The staff was super nice and helpful.  Can't say enough good things.  Just go eat here!",
   "This was our first visit here, on a Saturday around 10, we came in to try the Bloody Mary. Delicious!!! The mix was perfect, didn't taste overly tomatoey.  The food was excellent, large portions, three of us split our meals. Service was excellent, so you walk in, order in the back, they shout out whenever someone orders a Bloody Mary, you grab your water and silverware and find a table, they do have outdoor seating that is heated, indoor the tables are farm style and super cool. They will bring your food out to you.  Service is fast, prices are responsible for downtown Boise. They have cards on the table with questions and trivia to pass the time. Great crowd as well.  The staff is friendly and always moving. Great place to grab a bite, they do close at 3:00 on Saturday. We enjoyed the bacon sampler. We will be back!",
   "The spicy bacon Bloody Mary is a must here! Everything our table had was fantastic. I don\u2019t know what they put in their gravy but it\u2019s to die for.",
   "Bacon is awesome. This place has great breakfast. I had their special for the day waffles with bacon and eggs, it was delicious. Had the Chai tea too and it was yummy can\u2019t wait to go back. The environment is very relaxing as well.",
   "Food was really good and came out faster than our wait in line. We went on a Saturday for brunch and it was quite bumping. Flavor profiles were fairly balanced for the Bacon Lasagna and Arkansas entrees we had. The Lavender Fizzy Gin (or something akin, I can't fully remember the name) was light but you could still taste the Gin come through. Thoroughly enjoyed!"

   "Guys, I know it\u2019s a (fake) quarantine, but tonight\u2019s to go experience was just unacceptable. I was quoted 15 minutes of wait, it ended up being 35 minutes. Okay fine. We ordered our steaks medium rare: one ended up medium well, and the other was beyond well done. I ordered a large Caesar salad, and we got a side Caesar. There were multiple things you were out of. Again some grace is allotted here but overall this is not what I drove 40 minutes one-way to deal with. This was very disappointing and we probably should have just picked up locally instead.",
   "Great food and ambiance!  Service could be a little better.  They never cleared our app plates & had to ask for bread twice.  Drinks were timely and servers are very friendly.  This was during weekend lunch.  I will definitely be back!",
   "My husband and I came here for a date night for the first time last night, and we were extremely impressed! We don't go out for steak often as is so expensive, but they have some delicious affordable options. We got two entrees, some beer, and desert for 50$.\n\nNot to mention we had a great time. Setting wasn't too dark, and it was loud but not loud enough that we weren't able to hear each other. The food was amazing, I didn't even have a single complaint! This was the first time in my life I had a restaurant who cooked the steak PROPERLY, makes all the difference.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant if you haven't been. Our Waitress as well (Ainsley G.) was very sweet and accommodating. 100% would go here again!!!",
   "This is a great steak house with all the steak house things you might expect. The one thing that makes them stand out is the amount of seasoning on there food. It really jumps out at you in a great way. I would advise you to ask for lightly seasoned French fries if you get them. They can be a bit overpowering. Service has been incredible on both of my visits.",
   "The steak here is delicious the first time I came this place barely had opened the steak was way too salty for my taste and overcooked for what I had ordered. I gave it a while before I gave it another chance or was set in my review and oh my goodness I\u2019m def coming back! The steak was perfect and juicy this time no wonder it\u2019s so hard to get seating. The customer service also was good it could have been better but it was swamped so it\u2019s understandable. All in all def recommend and def coming back!"

They treated me very well. The food was fresh and tasty! I got the chicken fajitas and I loved it. The menu is very big - if you've got a large group, I'm sure everyone will find something appetizing from all the options. I definitely recommend checking out Chapala if you're in the area and you're craving Mexican food!!",
   "If you love dry, flavorless food covered with cheese, lettuce and tomato to mask the lack of authenticity, then come eat here. The food was sub-par. The chicken was dry and flavorless, it came in a generic hard shell loaded with lettuce cheese and tomato. Always be aware that if you want authentic Mexican food and you see Lettuce, Cheese and tomato, it\u2019s not authentic. The beans were very good and the rice so-so. Price $11.99\n\nMy GF ordered chicken tacos (generic hard shell) and an enchilada. She asked for Mole sauce -add$1. I tried it, it was horrible, tasteless and undercooked and the sauce was out of a can. Cost $12.\n\nTake the time to read the 1 star reviews. I\u2019m not going to bash this place but the food wasn\u2019t good at all. You\u2019re better off with Taco Bell or Del Taco.",

   "Stopped in for a drink with a friend, but ended up staying for dinner. The service was excellent, and our waiter went out of his way to make sure what I was ordering could in fact be made vegan before taking my order! \nThe taco menu offers many vegetarian options that can all be made vegan by removing the dairy items. I started with the crispy Brussels sprouts, which came with a caramel sauce. Even with the sauce they were vegan - and so, so good! I did 3 of the vegetarian tacos with no cheese or dairy sauces, and all of them were fantastic! The potato taco was my favorite. Top it off with great drinks and a fun atmosphere, this place is a gem and I will be back!",
   "Great atmosphere! We really enjoyed coming down and hanging out at the bar. The bar service was quick to serve our beverages whenever we wanted something. The food was a little slow coming out but well worth the wait. I'm pretty sure they forgot about my tacos since they didn't come out until after our other dish was gone. The staff were awesome though and comped the tacos since they took so long. Make sure to try the Diablo Saloon hot sauce, good stuff. We will definitely be back.",

Both of which were scrumptious and bursting with flavor. We also ordered the mango sticky rice, expecting a scoop of over-sweet glop in a bowl, but it was AMAZING. It comes in a banana leaf and it's warm, sweet, and comes with fresh mango and some sort of blue sauce (seriously, what is in this stuff- it's so good, I would bathe in it)!

The food is terrific and service courteous and prompt.  \n\nA long-time resident of Boise and having lived and worked in Thailand for ten plus years, I would rate Boise's Mai Thai food as good as, or better than, most of the Thai restaurants we frequented while living in Thailand.  \n\nNot a brag, just cold hard facts.  \n\nThe only Thai restaurants in Thailand as good as Boise's Mai Thai would be those in Thailand serving fresh caught seafood and those would be hard to beat just about anywhere.  \n\nRay Toronjo",

What was intended to just be a nice dinner for my girlfriend and I ended up being a romantic evening full of smiles. We were charmed by the owner who took the time to explain what  the exotic foods on the menu were and answer all of our questions. Even being our first time trying Indian Cuisine they still made us feel at home and part of the culture. If you're looking for a fine dining experience without the overpriced menu, give Taj Mahal a shot!",
   "All I can say is you gotta witness this for yourself. Great family owned restaurant in the valley. Feels like they bring unique flavors straight from the Indian Subcontinent. They do not use any artificial flavors or colors in their food. The family is very nice. Service is excellent. It can get a little busy so definitely would recommend making a reservation.",
   "I recently tried Indian food for the first time in Dallas, TX. I can not get enough of the spices and flavor. Taj Mahal in Boise is by far the best I have experienced. I can\u2019t wait to go back for more and more. We were lucky to meet the family who own and run this fine establishment tonight. We are so honored to have them in our town.",
   "Staff and especially the owner are very friendly and lively. It's always a pleasure to go here and chat with them. Their food is the best Indian food I've had in the treasure valley. I've tried many Indian cuisines and restaurants alike in the area and they just aren't as good as Taj Mahal. These guys are amazing and their food matches it every bit.",
   "Excellent food, generous portions. We ordered two entrees and got much more food than two people have business eating. We tried goat for the first time and enjoyed it. The paneer was done perfectly, soft, but with just a little bit of crispiness on the outside, and good flavor. The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere nice."

   "We ordered for pick up and it was SO delicious that I had to fight the kids to get a bite. Seriously try the feta fries!!!  My husband had the lamb gyro and said it was super tasty.  I had the Souvlaki plate with chicken that was super flavorful and loved that the chicken wasn't dried out.  Their pita is super soft and the sauces very taste.",
   "Quick service, good food and lots of choices. The fries were seasoned really well. The chicken gyro was tasty and well made. Nice presentation and ambience, good staff too.",
   "Food was alright. Received wrong order the first time but was fixed right away.  Everything just seemed way too salty. I probably won't eat here again. I think Gyro Shack is much better and even Arby\"s has better gyros. Fries were good.",
   "This place is awesome. A girl helped me. She was super nice. Not sure what her name was. She had red hair. She was great. Definitely made the experience worth it. Will be coming back. Also the food was awesome.",
   "Absolutely delicious! We went in with our 3 little boys and everyone was beyond satisfied. The food was fresh and super tasty! I love good Greek food and this place nailed it."

   "We have always loved this place! Our last visit (3-6-20) was the worst we had. First of all we ordered an appetizer which came after we got our main meal. The server made us feel that we had to take it, since we ordered it. Anyway, it appears the quality of food has gone down hill along with the service. My wife's cocktail  was wrong on the bill, so we do not know if it was the correct price.  I would have expected them to remove the cost of the appetizer or offer a free beer or something.... There was no apology or anything. Do not know what has happened there, but we will be spending our money at other places. All we were doing was looking to have a nice meal, which did not happen.",
   "The Front Door is a hidden gem in downtown Boise. The ambiance and vibe of this little pizza place is the perfect spot to enjoy some great food and friendly service. The food is very consistent and always delicious. Their beer selection is very diverse and rotates regularly so you can always find something new to try. They also have a full bar! I'm never disappointed when I grab a bite at Front Door!",
   "Went there for a special birthday lunch with friends.  The food was amazing.  I had the coconut curry special and it was perfectly seasoned.  The wait staff was quick and courteous and met all our needs. This place is a downtown favorite of mine because of the food, the staff, and the ambiance.",
   "Low key the best pizza in Boise. Plus, a nice selection of beers and sours. If you're willing to wait, they'll start slinging slices after 9pm. Couple slices and a beer and there's your Saturday night.",
   "I was in Boise on business and just happened to walk by this place. My first impression was not one of a pizza place. I saw just another bar slinging microbrews and passing off bar food as restaurant cuisine. At the end of my meal, I found nothing to convince me otherwise.  If you can put yourself in this mindset Front Door does offer slightly above average pub grub and reasonable prices. I had a cobb salad. This is my go-to meal when on the road and in a new place. The service was quick and the meal enjoyable. Overall I found Front Door a nice enough place for either a quick meal or a place to hang out and have a few drinks."

   "We enjoyed our breakfast here in a Sunday morning. Our children loved the waffles, which were dough instead of batter (like real Belgian waffles). The waffles had a delicious flavor, and every bite was gobbled up. The eggs and bacon were good, and my husband enjoyed the coffee. It was on the bitter side for me. The children have asked to eat here the next time we visit Boise. Great service, easy to talk to downtown and fast.",
   "Great unique breakfast food! Linked inside to Boise Fry Company. I had the Bobocado Deluxe. I wasn\u2019t sure how all those foods would taste together, but with my first bit I thought I was on another planet. It was incredible. If you like avocado and bacon, you have to give it a try.",
   "Enjoyed my experience here. I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. I just ordered the original waffle, but it was there best waffle I have ever had. It was a nice atmosphere and the workers were nice. I would definitely go back again.",
   "Blue plate is Bob Deluxe\nRed plate Bobacado Deluxe\n\nReally good waffle with the right amount of syrup and generous portions of bacon. \n\nGluten free options with no up charge. \n\nAtmosphere connect to Boise Fry which makes its a fun and upbeat.",
   "I really enjoyed the service, and something about it being a small restaurant brings joy. The food was amazing and I've never had anything like it before anywhere else. Highly recommend checking it out :)"

   "My family and I ate here. We wanted to try a new restaurant. As we walked in to the completely empty restaurant they asked if we had a reservation. I told them no and they acted like they were doing me a favor by seating me in their empty restaurant. There were only a few menu choices. For 4 of us it cost around $65 this was without ordering any extra items and only drinking water. The salad was an extra $6. But at $18 a plate you would think this would at least include a salad. Which looking at someone else next to us who got a salad it was mostly just a pile of lettuce. But I felt like there should have been a side item included with our one entree. The food quality was mediocre. It was definitely not worth the price. All 4 of us ordered something different and we didn't like any of it. It looked like it was going to be good but was not. One item we ordered was the disassembled lasagna and really it was only just meat sauce and noodle with a small dollop of ricotta cheese and the flavor I thought was gross. I ordered a vegetable plate that had asparagus, rice and squash mixed in for $13 and I added meatballs which cost me an extra $5 for 2 meat balls that were still pink inside. The vegetable plate was okay out of the 4 meals it was the best and it wasn't anything special for $18. Another plate we ordered was the Italian sausage fettuccine and no one even ate it. We all tried it but no one liked it. It was a waste of money. The last item we got was the shrimp scampi and that barely had any shrimp and the flavor wasn't great. They are way overpriced and for that cost the meal and flavor should have been way better tasting. I absolutely think this was a complete waste of money and I will not be back. Save your time and money and just go to olive garden. You at least get soup or salad with your meal and more menu choices. Response to owner: the only thing that I agree with about you response is that I would not be back for even a free meal if it was offered. Your meals are WAY overpriced.",
   "We tried this place out this evening and were pleasantly surprised. It\u2019s a nice, quaint little place.\n\nThe food was really good. The sauce was loaded, it was all sauce (see picture). The butter was delicious. Service wasn\u2019t lacking either. \n\nWe will be coming back for sure.",
   "We were a party of eight\nand ordered several different pastas and sauces.  Everything was delicious. \nHandmade, local pasta and from scratch sauces made at the restaurant. \nI can honestly say the best I have ever eaten. \nThe service was great and the\natmosphere was wonderful,\nquiet and cozy. We were able to enjoy\neach other and our conversations.\nI highly recommend il Sugo and will definitely come here again.",
   "I could not have been more delighted with my first dining experience at iL Sugo!!  As I walked into the restaurant, Grant and Athena greeted me as if I was walking into their home!  Everything had just the right touch-the service was gracious and efficient but not intrusive.  The decor was cozy and inviting.  I love the menu concept-fresh home made pastas with a variety of sauces to choose from.  Salads, appetizers, wine and coffee-enough choices but not overwhelming.  We were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a fabulous dessert-complimentary!\n\nI highly recommend il Sugo-the owner and staff are sincere in their intention to provide an authentic, delicious and memorable dining experience!",
   "Really, really enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere at IlSugo. The Tartufo pasta dish was amazing, and the deconstructed lasagna was very good. Grant knows how to create good that tastes amazing! We had this food at a catered event and had to come into the restaurant, but it was booked! We persisted, and it was worth it!"

I have severe gluten intolerance and have never had a problem eating here. Their chai tea is the absolute best! My personal opinion is this gem will be very very missed once they sale. No one can compare with quality of food, service and the variety of amazing authentic Indian cuisine. Please enjoy their food and beverage before they sell and are gone forever. My humble opinion. Love them so much.",
   "Went for the lunch buffet and it was phenomenal. First time really trying Indian food and I was blown away (along with everyone else in my group). $11.65 for high quality buffet food. Will definitely be back!!",
   "The food at Bombay Grill is always dependably wonderful! In particular, I don't think I've ever had better butter chicken. The owners are gracious lovely people. Give it a try. You may find a new favorite restaurant!",
   "Great buffet! Tastes delicious. I would rather say 4.5 stars..Though We had to ask for bread, go to fill water by ourselves..but later when I went for tea, they happily offered me tea as per my taste .. small things, but add value! Good luck!",
   "Out of town, wandering downtown Boise. Enjoy Indian food, so I stopped for a lunch buffet to go. Good selection and reasonable price. Very helpful staff and generously gave me an extra container for yogurt sauce, plus a container of mukwas!  Food was yummy!"

It has become a must have at least once a week for my wife and I. Keep up the great work and see you again soon.",

They got a little slammed tonight with take orders (times are different now with only take out and no dine-in), so our order was not ready on time. However, the customer service was great, very apologetic for not being ready on time and they were really doing their best. Food was yummy and just hoping some of these dining estabishments can survive this hit to their business right now."

Both times it was over cooked and the breading was very hard. Didn't want to chance it again so I had chicken tenders which were very good. Excellent atmosphere and staff. Always enjoy the side dishes.",

   "We went there on Saturday night. The location is great. They have seats by the open wide windows facing 8th street which we enjoyed a lot. The environment was casual and friendly and there was an authentic pizza oven at the center. Pretty cool to me plus you couldn't smell any burning oil or smoke in there which is an issue for me at indoor busy restaurants.\nOur server was shaved head long bearded gentleman who gave us an extraordinary service. \nWe ordered roasted tomatoes with goat cheese for appetizer which was one of the best appetizers I had so far! It is spicy hot as it should be!\nThe pizza was authentic and taste delicious!the ingredients were fresh!\n\nDo not expect anything like your usual Domino's pizza. This is different!\nIf you feel like eating greasy salty pizza, don't go here this time! But if you feel like eating Italian pizza this is the place!",
   "Went here for the very first time. The staff were WONDERFUL! Stopped in with no reservation before the lunch rush and since it was our first time they took us to a great view! Because we were first timers our waiter gave us the detailed low-down on what everything is in a professional friendly manner. My mother has sight problems and he was so very patient with her which I very much appreciated. My brother has social anxiety and speaks low when near many people, our waiter simply got closer and spoke to him, almost kinder I would like to say. I wish I remembered our hostess and waiters name!! Their selection of items was incredibly inclusive to those who are vegan, food allergies and of course our meat eaters! Food preparation was beautiful (not sure authentic because I'm not Italian nor know what the authentic dishes look like...) we definitely thought we didnt order enough food until we started eating! It was more than enough with left overs to take on the road! Keep up the amazing service and foods we will sure to be back!",
   "We absolutely loved the vibe of this place! Our waiter was very friendly and quick. We ordered the Alfredo chicken pizza and it was truly delicious!! I'd say my only minor complaint was that it was super loud but it was also a Friday night and again I don't think it's meant to be a quiet sit down necessarily. Would go again!",
   "We\u2019ve being going to your restaurant before you moved into the Zion building and have never had a bad experience. When friends come into town, it\u2019s the first place we think of when dining out for dinner. There are many good choices in downtown Boise and have always considered you as one of them...until last night. I\u2019m not sure if there is new management or maybe a new cook, but when all three of our meals are not close to being the standard of what we have come to expect from Flatbread, then something is wrong. \nI had the Rosemary Chicken sandwich which is normally an extremely tasty sandwich that I always order. Last night it was very dry and unpleasantly tasteless. I did eat half of it because I was hungry. My sister-in-law had the Alfredo the Grate. It was cold and dry and had no bacon and only two pieces of artichoke. My wife had the Chicken Parmigiana which was overcooked and very greasy. \nThe one bright spot was the Wood-Roasted Cauliflower appetizer. \nOverall, it was a bad experience that makes choosing Flatbread the next time we dine-out not one of our options.",
   "Sadly my favorite pizza, the white truffle mushroom, has been removed from the menu, and I have yet to find a pizza that compares to it. I have been a regular at this place for years, for good reason. Their service is always perfect. The appetizers, drinks, and pizzas are perfect, and the location has perfect views of downtown Boise. Everything about this place is perfect. (except the empty spot on the menu where there used to be a truffle pizza)"

I enjoyed the dragon roll, better than a lot of places I've had them at. My favorite would have been the dumplings. No complaints all the way around. Great service. I thought the kids menu was a little lacking but with that being said, the kiddos were happy with their order as well.",

   "The table was sticky, either from a lack of cleanliness or the finish coming off.  Food was mediocre.  Asian Pear Mojito tasted like pure syrup.  Our sushi roll came out after we were done eating.  Bathroom is disgusting.\nThe place is definitely not the quality it was originally.\nOnly redeeming quality was our kind server and he took off the charge for the sushi roll.",
   "It was all amazing and wonderful. It's no surprise that they are known for their lettuce wraps. They we a great starter. We had a Korean steak, and a sea bass, shared so we both got some of each. I don't usually order my steak as rare as this was (medium rare), but it was so nicely seared and marinated and had such a great sauce that I didn't mind that it wasn't quite my usual medium. The sea bass was seared just long enough to cook cook it through and the sear on ours was perfect. I'm not usually a fan of dark chocolate, but I recommend the great wall of chocolate.",
   "The food was good, but the service was horrid. Our particular server had just come back from \"vacation\" and stated he wasn't familiar with 2 out of the 3 items we had questions about.  This was the special menu. He also forgot to put in an order and our appetizers came out with entrees.  \nLet me be clear, it was NOT busy. He also never smiled. In my opinion a tip is similar to a commission. You have to work for it. If you are not happy with the wages, then you either work for tips to compensate with a smile, friendly service,  and menu knowledge or you get a different job. This man was not welcoming nor looking for any compensation. \n\nIt was discouraging because the host was very welcoming, the atmosphere was calming,  and the food was good. If I go back, it will be an order to go."
