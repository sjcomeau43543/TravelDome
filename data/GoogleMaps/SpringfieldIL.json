   "The street of Lincoln's house was closed which made it very pleasant and easier for taking pictures. Also, if the tour was full and couldn't get to go inside his house, you could still visit the neighbors' houses which were full of facts and preserved subjects. All for free. The parking was only a minute walk from the house, super convenient. Worth the time.",
   "What a fabulous experience.   The whole block is managed by the National Park Service.   You have to go to the visitor's center to get tickets to go on the tour of the home, but it is well worth any wait.   Our park ranger was great and the tour was just wonderful.   We did a full review on our blog site and YouTube channel.",
   "So, I love history. Especially American history. If you are like me or even just lukewarm on things like this, than I highly recommend visiting the Lincoln home. \n\nThe tour guide was thorough and also quite witty. The house is in great condition and unlike Washington\u2019s Mt. Vernon estate, photography and filming are both allowed inside the Lincoln home. I believe there was a very small cost associated with visiting the home. Maybe $2 and you get your tickets at this little Lincoln Home historic park site building not far from the home. This is also where you park and the $2 might only have been for the parking, my memory is unfortunately not clear on that any longer. \n\nIt was quite a thrill picturing the Lincoln\u2019s in their home for things like Christmas, birthdays etc. There is much of the inside and outside of the home that is original.",
   "Love this place been there many times,with my Children when they were young and now with my oldest brother now that we're both retired. History in your face!.. You get to ponder the life of or greatest President and see were by he lived and loved his family! before the weight of the Presidency and the war to save are United states was placed upon him. The place were he was a regular guy... I recomend it for every American and a great place for foreign visitors to see what America is all about!",
   "Fabulous place to take a tour. The rangers are nice and quite knowledgeable. If you go in the winter they put out furniture and objects that they don\u2019t have out in the summer. There\u2019s a movie, a quite expansive visitors center, and a gift shop as well. Parking is $2 per hour or you can use street parking."

   "One of my favorite places in Springfield. It's a great place for a walk the dog, jog, bike. Go for a short hike. Feed some ducks. And apparently fish. It has a decent size playground. Tennis courts and if your lucky you'll get to see a deer family.",
   "Great place to do all kinds of family oriented activities and personal exercise. Wonderful large areas for picnics or even a peaceful place to relax and read or have personal time. Has great options of things to do and see throughout the park. Beautiful places for photography and weddings. The Carrollon is beautiful as well as the gardens around it. The large ponds are great for letting children feed ducks and catch n release fish. An all around great park within Springfield",

   "I\u2019d recommend visiting because this building is a snapshot in time. It was used for only a short period before the \u201cnew\u201d state house was built. Also, it was built before electric or gas light, which is interesting to see from an architectural point of view (the windows are incredible). \nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting memorabilia and the staff is friendly. \nIt would probably benefit from better signage but the staff is happy to answer questions and give the rundown on the building.",
   "Amazing historical landmark! The place could use a little love on the maintenance end. I get that the building is older but they still have plenty of guests coming to visit and could stand to at least fix the stalls in the restroom. None of the stall doors locked properly and even had hand written notes to NOT lock them.\n\nIt is still a place that always leaves me in awe to think of the amazing history that was created there.",
   "This was our first year visiting during the Christmas  season.We did a free carriage ride that provided warm blankets. We visited the Old State Capitol where  we were greeted by Santa and  Mrs Claus who handed out candy canes. Crafts and old fashioned toys for the kids to enjoy...hot cocoa and yummy treats as you walk down the streets. Smiling faces and Christmas cheer to keep you thru the rest of this year.",
   "We stay the last august on our honeymoon. It was a very good hotel our stay was fantastic and they take care of every detail. It's a very good option here because not all the hotels are very good. I hope to go here for our other visits.",
   "Very nice place. The art and the design of the building is superb. It has a lot of history while still being able to be modern. The old state capitol is also a good place to visit if you wanna see another piece of Illinois History. Easy parking and very nice staff."

We went about a hour before close and the museum was basically empty which was really nice because we were able to take lots of nice photos and spend as much time as we wanted at each part of it. I really wish we were able to see the full rock and rolled exhibit that is coming but we were only able to see part of it. Would recommend for anybody who enjoys museums to go here!",
   "It is very easy to find a Lincoln related historical site in Springfield. You can basically find one on every corner. This museum is about all the history outside of Abe Lincoln. Which is a fantastic thing. This hidden gem of a museum is a must so for locals an visitors alike. The entrance fees are very reasonable and the value for the money is fantastic.",
   "Museum after hours was a lot of fun! Had a good beer and learned about some new games from the folk at Titan Games. Good music as well!",
   "Good place to visit for anybody who is interested in science or history. At the time of my visit the place was almost empty. Have been living in Illinois for a long time yet I learned a lot about history of this state. Some historical facts were actually very surprising for me.",
   "Nice way to spend some time. My 2 kids liked the main floor. The upstairs is more for adults and the basement is now for small kids."

They set out tables the way we request and the exact number of chairs, while allowing us access to more if we need them. The kitchen is perfect for our needs, and the updates are gorgeous. I wish I had taken before and after pictures. Thank you, Springfield Park District and the Botanical Gardens staff for all you do for the Iris Society!",
   "Great place to walk. Make sure to see the Greenhouse!",
   "Building open 12-4. Grounds I would say are sunrise to sunset.  Grounds are immaculate.  Stunning. A public park which has no litter, graffiti, the paths are absolutely perfect.  or even a leaf out of place. Very Impressive.   (A drinking fountain or faucet would be nice.  Though the cold weather in winter likely makes such a desire unlikely.)"

Clean and well maintained grounds. Room to spread out and run around. The pavillion is an added bonus for larger more formal functions.",

A few months ago we were able to have the suicide walk here and they let my group lead the way.. they supported us because the loss of our friend was still fresh so they wanted to do as much as they could for us. Its also a great place for kids to run around and play",
   "Southwind Park is relatively new and very well kept. There are multiple playgrounds, a stocked pond, a splash pad and plenty of places to sit. Several pavilions offer space to gather and there are bathrooms that are clean and accessible. The paths in the past are smooth concrete, making it great for strollers, bikes, and wheelchairs. I feel like this is probably the best park in Springfield if you are in a wheelchair.\nThe downside to it is that this park is pretty out of the way, being on the southern edge of Springfield.",

Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture and eye for design is something you need to see for yourself. You also learn a lot about the house's history and how it is involved with Springfield. Ms. Dana has an amazing history of her own as well.",
   "Fabulous example of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture, beautifully restored.  Be sure to visit during the Christmas season when it's beautifully decorated for the holidays!",
   "Beautiful architecture, great tour guide, a fun indoor activity for Springfield, IL. I like that the entry fee is a donation of your own choosing. FYI free parking is available specifically for the Dana Thomas house in a lot off of Cook St.",
   "This place was super cool. I'm not a big architecture buff and I don't know much about Frank Lloyd Wright, but I loved this house. I would never want to live there b/c it's just not my style, but I so appreciated how integrated the house was together, how purposeful everything that was included was, and all of the architectural details and sight lines. And to think he built that style of house in 1902, people must have thought he was utterly insane. It looks so different from other stuff that was being built at that time.\n\nThe tour is well worth the time and the donation they suggest and I would highly recommend it to anyone in Springfield for a visit.",
   "This home has been ingrained in my memory ever since I took my first tour 10 years ago. It is a magnificent home and a true treasure. It goes without saying that FLW was a remarkable architect and it is evidenced by this house. This is treat for any person who loves architecture in any form. In addition to the house, the woman behind it was very interesting and I loved the information you learn about her on the tour. This is a MUST when coming to Springfield."

It's very well preserved and they make it fun to walk about  on the wooden sidewalks  in the  area. It was  a beautiful perfect day when I went.  It's very charming.",
   "Fantastic place to visit.  When someone thinks of visiting Lincoln's home you will be surprised to find more than just the house that he lived in.   Because this historic site has 2 blocks of preserved homes (with some people dressed in period clothing) you have a feeling of going back in history.  The only thing I would like to see is to have each historic home being furnished with period furnishings.  A number of the homes were filled with signs and photos  explaining some of the history.  Lincoln's home was filled with Lincoln's belongings and furniture - very nice!!",

Here there are various special programs including trick or treating and other speakers and activities.",

Great, isn't it? Anyway, hit the visitor center to learn about all things Lincoln, and you may even get to hear a speech by a great Lincoln impersonator. I thought I was hearing the speech from the man himself. A great experience!"

Although, at the time of my visit, the sculpture in front of the museum was rather odd, I did learn about the back story, so it made more sense.  I would say kids under 10 might not be so interested.    Also, if short on time, start with the White House years.",
   "Both moving and deeply felt, the A Lincoln Pres Museum does not merely portray his presidency. It shows us, in depth, the path Lincoln took from his youth to old age and the making of America's bold, steadfast civil wartime president and how he kept the union together. Be prepared to be challenged, be enlightened and be galvanized by the undying memory of our 16th president.",
   "Loved how the Museum was set up. Very informative and interesting.",
   "The Presidential Museum is beautiful!!!! A perfect tribute to our beloved President Lincoln!!!!! But l do have a couple of suggestions for improvement if l may! Let's get real here let's keep the political correctness out of this museum built in honor of the Greatest President of the United States of America and the greatest human being that held this office!!!! Why isn't there any displays of Civial war firearms and sword's in the room were all the verious Civial war uniforms are displayed? After all the Civial war wasn't fought by throwing rocks at each other!!!!! The other thing is the room where the President is laying in state! The casket, the funeral tent the lights everything is right on with the picture except There should be  a wax figure of President Lincoln's body in the casket and two Civial war soldier's standing by the casket!!!! Every major city from Washington DC to Springfield the funeral train stopped where  he layed in state the casket was open!!!! This is just reality and constructive feedback!!!!!"

A good place to bring the kids and pets for a walk, and sunset is especially clamoring if you're looking for a good date around town.  The fountain is dormant now but should be running soon (currently it is may)",
   "We took the kids to hear the free carillon concert at 1pm. It's a very nice park with plenty of benches and gardens to wander through while listening to the bells. There is also a video screen at the base of the bell tower so you can see the carillon player during the concert. Tours of the tower are available for a small charge when the bells aren't being played. This was a fun little break from all the historical attractions in town.",
   "Concerts are awesome in the summer time and such a great sound to hear while walking in the park.",
   "We were lucky enough to be in Washington Park when the Carillon was open for tours.  The tour guide was very gracious and patient with our children, in addition to being very knowledgeable.  The tour is succinct, delivering interesting information in an appropriate length of time.  We would highly recommend it for anyone seeking to know a bit more."

   "This is a place right near the Lincoln tomb so if you are visiting the tomb swing by this place. This is someone's connection that they are sharing with the public and wow it is a fantastic collection. It is free to enter but you can make a donation if you wish to. They had some cute cats running around and they just laid on the floor in front of me wanting to be pet. Some of the planes are open that you can sit in and take pictures. I will come here again that's for sure.  This is on my list of places to see in Springfield if you are there... check it out. Any questions just ask!",
   "While in the area to tour the Lincoln Monument, we saw the Air Combat Museum on the map and stopped by.  What an interesting working museum! The young man, sorry I can't recall his name, was extremely knowledgable of the history and/or a story of each plane, and there are quite a few.  A a mixture of aircraft-Mustang;  one of the last, if not the last air worthy Corsair; a MIG, an acrobatic plane and several others.  Thanks for keeping the history alive!",

I'm proud of my home town for having grown enough in culture & diversity to even have this museum in the first place. African-american history is history. There should be no separation or distinction necessary and it's just as important for non African Americans to know true all inclusive history as it is for us.",
   "Great exhibits, especially the ones dedicated to African Americans in early Illinois. Had a great experience, and I definitely left with a desire to learn more.",
   "I attended the grand opening in the summer of 2018. ILLINOIS has a particularly profound African American history that changed the course of the country and thus the world. From President Abraham Lincoln, to President Barack Obama and the nasty 1908 race riot, the catalyst for the NAACP, providing legal protection against racism. This museum offers this history, in addition to special events, such as the annual gala honoring local contributions to the community."

There are certain pieces that have been completely restored, others from the time period, some the actually belong to members of the Edwards family, and then you have the fun game of the wallpaper.

Close to downtown. \nI'm not well versed in church design, so I can't describe it properly. Well worth the effort to see.",

   "Beautiful, restful small cathedral.",
   "A beautiful, restful place of prayer. Confessions and Mass are offered daily. Sometimes I enjoy just coming to sit and pray in the middle of a hectic day. For the art inclined, the mosaics are okay but the windows are worth a stop. Many depict events in the history of the diocese and have themes and images somewhat unexpected for a church.  The organ was just refurbished and offers great, full sound to accompany either Mass or one of the concerts offered in the space."

There is a down to earth mentality and a charm not commonly found in other places.

The original town was faithfully reconstructed from the recollections and assistance of original residents. There are even a few areas that are yet original (such as the Cooper Shop).",

There is a restaurant inside, but I did not go there. Staff are very friendly also. A total win for our family!",

And don't forget that your museum ticket also gets you into the railway station right across the street!\n\nThe Lincoln home and old state capitol are an easy walk away.\n\nInsider tip: DO NOT SKIP the \"Ghosts of the Library\" show at the Lincoln Museum. It's interesting and quite powerful!",
   "Very good museum.  Comprehensive of Lincoln, but overall felt short, granted we didn't watch the two \"movies\". It's clean, costs about $15 for a ticket, 5 for a kid 5.  Lots of stuff about slavery and war, so if you've got kids be ready!"

   "Dr. Trudeau is very kind, gentle, caring, funny, and compassionate.  If you need an EMG, he is the doctor to see, the test was quick and painless. Highly recommend!",
   "Dr. Trudeau is the Best at what he does, he knows his equipment an exactly where he needs to go to get you the very best results on your testing. He and his staff is curtious  and very professional, an it\u2019s all done with a sense of humor to get you through the test. It\u2019s over before you know it, I can truly say this was one doctor appointment that I really enjoyed. \nHe sent the results to my doctor very quickly an had everything my surgeon needed for my surgery. \nMonths down the road my case turned into one that was something totally unexpected. I had a allergic reaction to one of the anesthesia\u2019s used in surgery so it had to be stopped to get blood pressure back up. This was turning into a nightmare trying to figure out where an who to see to get the testing needed to finish my surgery. \nBamm, I told my wife I\u2019m calling Dr. Trudeau he\u2019ll know what an where to call. So called the office an Bobbie answered, I told her who I was an she remembered. She let me know that  the doctor was at the hospital with patients an she would have him call me back. That evening Dr.  Trudeau called after Bobble told him what had happened to me. \nDr was quick to give me guidance to get me on my on my feet again. He also advised me on how serious it is to get this resolved. \nI can\u2019t begin to to tell you how relieved I was getting his call that night. He\u2019s probably one of the most caring doctors you will ever meet ! \nI told him when I got fixed I\u2019m coming back to take him to lunch, it\u2019ll be my pleasure just to visit with him again. \nSincerely,\nJohn Shallenberger",
   "Dr. Trudeau is a wonderful doctor.  He is thorough, precise, and he takes his time to provide his patients eith the upmost care.  Most of all he puts his patients at ease by thoroughly explaining tests right down to the tiniest detail.  I can honestly say that I actually enjoyed my appointment which is a rare, if not non-existent.",

   "Great place to explore the history of the native Americans that lived on the Illinois River and the people of that time period. Beautiful place at the park on top the hill at the museum.  Over looking the river valley, beautiful place to have a wedding. They have a pevion u can rent with power.  Make a donation to the museum is the charge. My daughter had her wedding there.  It was amazing.",
   "Artifact fair today!! GREAT displays!! Friendly folks willing and eager to share their knowledge.",
   "Museum and grounds are a little dated having it's last remodel in 1994. It's still a very nice facility with nice picnic area and playground. It's such a nice place to take an afternoon trip. The grounds are absolutely beautiful in the fall!!",
   "great history shown about the native Indians in the prairie state. glad they finally closed buried the remains and not made to the public. real people living in tents like the past days. very educational with nice exhibits. a must stop for travellers."

   "Dr. Romanelli is a wonderful doctor. I had knee replacement surgery on November 5th and I was up and walking right away. \nI attended rehab classes at The rehabilitation center at the Orthopedic Center. \nKayla and Rachel were my primary therapists and they were wonderful.  I have finished my therapy sessions and my knee is doing wonderful. I highly recommend them.",
   "Dr Romenelli replaced my knee and was attentive to my ongoing care. His dedication to his profession was demonstrated throughout my initial and last visit with him! He gave me my swagger back! Thank you Dr. Romenelli!\ud83d\ude0a",
   "This was my first knee replacement. I am very pleased with my surgery. All aspects of the surgery were clearly explained and discussed. Questions were encouraged. I called several times with questions I hadn\u2019t thought about during office visits. Each of my questions were answered that day by patient, professional people. The joint class at St John\u2019s helped make me more aware of what would happen to me, and all the things I needed to know to be prepared. I was still a bit anxious, it was major surgery after all, but I was able to sleep well before the procedure. Events happened as expected, no surprises. I received excellent care at St John\u2019s. Dr Romanelli talked with me before and after the surgery to tell me again what he planned to do in surgery, and after to describe what happened and tell me about the pain management, therapy and discharge expectations. I called a couple of times after surgery, and received answers and assistance as needed. I was very pleased with Dr Romanelli and all of the people associated with OGI. \nI am having my right knee replaced by OGI in February 2020.",
   "First appt with Dr. Romanelli but very impressed with him!  He not only jumped on starting my treatment that day but already is thinking down the road several steps ahead in case things don't work.",
   "The treatment I received from dr Romanelli and his staff could not have been better. The procedure to fully replace my right shoulder went beyond my expectations.  I would recommend dr Romanelli to anyone for anything that he does. I can\u2019t express how satisfied I am. Leonard white"

   "In comparison to other discovery museums, they really went bare minimum on there exhibits, I have a feeling the grant money went to other (pet) Uptown projects, instead of child development, and exploration. Would you feel comfortable letting your child climb in the discovery net? refer to the picture, notice the missing cable clamps, instead they tied the cables in knots and wrapped they in duct tape. TOP NOTCH MAINTENANCE",
   "The BEST kids activity in town! We have been members for several years and still enjoy every visit. Three floors of fun for all ages, plus many classes and special activities throughout the year. Always very clean, friendly staff, and a fun gift shop.",

   "I want it said, my 4 stars instead of 5 comes solely because its a small zoo. It is a great experience for what it is. They have a wonderful old carousel in the middle for small children that need a break (get tickets before you enter). They hosted baby snow leopards at one time and have some really nice upclose views of their rain forest exhibit and a few giant tortoises. At one time the family pass would get you in free or discounted to other nearby zoos too. I do not know if that is still the case but it was a very nice perk.",
   "I love this zoo. Every time you go is a good time! It's a small zoo but it's ALWAYS fun and eventful. You can look on their website and find fun days. My daughter always loves getting her face painted.",
   "Great zoo. The animals here are particularly cute and pretty fuzzy for the most part. There was an owl that looked at me funny every time we walked by him. Pretty suspicious, actually. Consider getting panda."

For $64 for a family or 4, I would have rather went to Chicago. \n\nThe positive?  The building is very cool and the outside sculptures are really good.  And the staff is really nice.",
   "It was decent. A lot of things need repairs and upgraded. Science stuff kind of neat. Kids enjoyed the museum some pretty cool history for Peoria Illinois. Worth a visit if you need something for the kids to do. Especially cool for people near or from the area and travelers alike. It takes about 2 hours minimum for a good visit.",
   "We went on the free day and it didn't last too long for us. We got to explore a bit and from what we saw it was awesome. We can't wait to go back when it's a bit calmer so we can see more",
   "A very nice educational trip for the kids and grownups. Staff has always been polite and very helpful. Pay attention to what exhibits and movies are playing, you may miss something you would enjoy. I recommend becoming a member if you are able. There are some nice perks to grab from time to time by doing so.",
   "Only recently went, wish I had checked it out sooner. We went to both the moon and Leonardo DaVinci exhibits, both were very cool. Easily spent an hour at each one reading all the signs and little things. Parking is easy, and exhibits so far have been worth the price of admission. Music shows in the dome are a good time as well, loud with neat displays. My eye will be on what comes through next."

   "Was a very fun and informative place. Tractors ect that kids could climb on and play on. They have simulators that was pretty cool for the adults and kids alike. Good place to visit with kids or as an adult. Retired Cat employees on the floor to answer questions. I would recommend checking it out.",
   "It's a neat place; however, when the sole recognizable purpose of the venue is the glorification of Caterpillar you would expect the entrance fee to be a little less steep.\n\nCat employees get a discount, and the employee gets in free. A fair expectation for the amount of money Caterpillar pumped into the Foundation.\n\nWhat you wouldn't expect is offering little or no discount to a school group visiting for educational purposes (and the number of parents who work at Caterpillar). Considering this is owned by a not for profit foundation, it makes no sense why they wouldn't reach out a little more vigorously.\n\nOverall, when the Visitors Center was new, I could state it had some \"state of the art\" technology displays. As the place ages, and technology progresses, I would expect more frequent updates to the technology exhibits or a lower entry price.",
   "Such a fun place for the family and kids. Very clean. So much to do and learn. This is  a must for anyone passing through Peoria",
   "While there more for fun than education, I was introduced to the history of the CAT company. The initial movie is more of a sales pitch than a history lesson however, the fact that an entire theater fits in the bed of the largest vehicle made by them is fantastic.\n\nAs you move about the museum, you find touchstones of the past and the company vision for their future. \n\nI would definitely recommend visiting this place.",
   "Very reasonable admission price, you go in and watch a short video, then go downstairs to an equipment floor.  You can climb up to the cab/control area of the machines.  There are simulators for kids for all ages.  There should be plenty of fun for kids.  Then there are exhibits about manufacturing and the history of the company.  It took about 1.5 hours to see it all."

   "So, I love history! If you don\u2019t, you may not see this as a worthwhile place to visit. I get into it, though.\n\nThis is an ancient mound site of the Cahokia People. There are signs around and paths for you to follow that explain what everything is. \n\nWhile walking around this entire area I could picture in my mind\u2019s eye what it may have looked like anciently...the homes, indigenous people walking around. \n\nFrom the top of the main mound you can easily see St. Louis although it looks a good distance away. I counted the steps to the top of the mound when I visited, but danged if I can\u2019t remember how many there are now. Total shot in the dark, but I want to say around 188-ish...\n\nGreat views from the top of the big mound.",
   "This is probably one of the absolute coolest museums I've ever been to. Very well done, incredibly knowledgeable staff, amazing history and artifacts. Will definitely be back",
   "On our way home from St Louis we stopped at the park. A part of North American history everyone should be aware of. Visitor center is modern with nice short film. Walking trails aroun the mounds are easy. Lots of steps on the largest mound. Park easy access from the Interstate.",
   "We had a quick and fun stop here. \nWe went to the large mound with the staircase. Not recommended for those who can't handle a great deal of stairs. For those who can, the view is great. \nParking was crowded as it was a saturday afternoon, so be patient in the lot. \nThere was an interpretive center across the street that had information for a suggest donation."

Even the pool towels were replenished prior being completely depleted late in the evening. Can't say enough good things about the hospitality, happy hour everything!!! No competition for receiving the most Bang for your buck.",
   "Great rooms. Great price. Loved the afternoon reception. Staff members really friendly.",
   "We stayed here for just a couple of nights, but my 5 year old ended up getting a stomach bug on the first night. We had to call down late at night to get a change of sheets. The staff quickly came up and replaced the sheets and were extremely friendly and understanding. The next morning I went down to the front desk for something and again, they were extremely friendly. They asked about my daughter and made sure she was okay. They offered to get her whatever she needed even if the breakfast was no longer out. They offered to come clean the room or whatever we needed. When housekeeping came to change the sheets and replace the towels, I was still in the room with my daughter because she was still sick and I didn't want to contaminate the rest of the hotel. The lady offered to run across the street to get my daughter peidalyte and I have never been so taken aback by someone's offer. I politely declined, but this hotel staff has gone above and beyond my expectations. The entire stay so far has been wonderful, the hotel is clean, the pool and hot tub are nice, breakfast was good, but mainly this staff is outstanding. I will absolutely be coming back here!",
   "All drurys are the same. Which isn't bad.  The staff will always bend over backwards to help you with any problem you may have. I do hope however that the corporation is paying these people a wage that can provide them a comfortable life. Hospitality starts at home and I hope the Drury corporation is hospitable enough to take care of their most valuable asset... their staff. For through them gems blossom."

All the employees where nice and courteous. I would recommend checking it out.",

For young families I would suggest bringing your own food and drinks as the prices are a little steep in the restaurant.  The souvenir shop has a large selection from which you can find more reasonably priced items to remember your visit.",

   "Always a treat to go to Caf\u00e9 Moxo, whether for a big lunch or just for a cup of coffee.  Great food, welcoming environment, very clean, and very friendly staff and management.  Shout out to Brandon... always on top of things and always has a big, sincere smile."

   "My husband and I went to Indigo last night to celebrate Valentines day.  The service and food was excellent.  Everything was brought out one at a time so we werent bombarded with a ton of food all at once.  We even got a complimentary hummus plate which maybe they offer to guests anyways but it was a nice surprise.  Our server helped us make our night special by taking good care of us and knowing when to just let us enjoy each others company.  We spent a lot but we planned on doing so instead of getting each other gifts so we went all out.  Did not disappoint.  Great job Indigo!",
   "The staff was very helpful. We love to bring our business clients here.   Repeat customer... Will be back again and again",
   "EZ was a great waiter and host.  I thoroughly enjoyed the environment and the food was superb! The only problem is that they're not open for lunch.  Definitely a great dinner spot.",
   "Great server, Lindsay. The duck enchiladas were amazing, the stone appetizer was phenomenal, the tuna main course was perfect! Lobster bisque was wonderful.  Absolutely no negative remarks are necessary!!!!",
   "Indigo was excellent. The atmosphere is cozy and I enjoyed the dim lighting. Our waitress was very attentive and gave lots of information about the menu. Lots of wine and appetizer options, which was impressive. The cheese plate we ordered was good and our salads came with a hummus plate with olives that was delicious. My boyfriend was extremely impressed with the flavor of his filet. I ordered the king crab legs and they were good, just not as flavorful as the snow crab I would normally order elsewhere. The restaurant was a bit pricy but, overall, I enjoyed my experience and will return with friends next time."

   "This is a first-rate restaurant in an unexpected location. The creative food prepared here is on par with any restaurant in a world-capitol city, not a State one... Tried to eat everything, but the extensive menu makes that impossible. Everything was crafted with care and the service from Kimberly was attentive but unobtrusive. \n\nThis restaurant receives my highest recommendation if you are in Springfield!",
   "This is my favorite restaurant around Springfield. The food is absolutely amazing. Sometimes the descriptions of the food sound like really odd combos, but they always work so well. It is on the pricey side, but it's absolutely worth it. They even have interesting and delicious cocktails. My favorite has been The Dude Abides, which was their take on a white russian.",
   "Great menu creativity, but I cannot bring myself to support an establishment that treats employees the way they do here. Lots of discrimination. I saw zero servers who were not Caucasian, but many minorities working in the back doing dishes and other prep. It\u2019s 2020. Can we please get over this. Not okay and will not support them again.",
   "Menu offers a lot of variety, everything I've eaten here has been pretty good. Expect long wait times for a table, and consider sitting a the bar. Probably one of the best restaurants in Springfield in terms of menu offerings, food quality, and service.",
   "Every detail is extraordinary! The ruby trout was delicious and well prepared, and the accompaniments were both diverse and harmonious. The pear pressure cocktail was a special for that night, and it was fantastic, but the 6 degrees of kevin bacon was a work if art! The candied bacon in the drink was soooo good!!! \nA fantastic find for the drive between Chicago and St. Louis!"

   "Kayla our server was terrific. We each ordered a paddle of beers.  She was very knowledgeable.  Started with cheese curds that were pillow soft and so flavorful.  The spicy dipping sauce worked with the cheese beautifully.  We shared a harvest salad.  It was delicious. Pecans, blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens a maple vinaigrette that I wasn't sure about but it was really good.   Hubby had the fish and chips I had the ruben, both with these great natural French fries.  Fish was perfect sandwich was awesome.  Next time we're in Springfield we'll definitely go back.",
   "Absolutely love coming here when I'm visiting Springfield! Last time we came through they had a  tasty Blood Orange IPA on draft that was delicious and paired nicely with the featured Poutine Burger. Ian made our visit a memorable one and he had some great recommendations as we loved the loaded potato cakes! He was also very knowledgeable on all the food sources and beer making process and it was really cool to learn about! Can't wait to come back for a horseshoe soon.",
   "Always on the lookout for a good reuben. They make their own corned beef and dressing, have fairly fresh crout, and marbled rye. Was delicious! Good, but not great, beer.",
   "Kayla was absolutely the best!   Very attentive and yet not intrusive!    She knew the menu very well and answered all of our questions!   The Mikes Hot Ham was phenomenal.    Great food and great service made for a very enjoyable meal!"

I could start with how the simplest offering; the bread (House made) paired with whipped butter playfully infused with strawberry and tarragon is simply amazing! \n\nThe Manchurian Cauliflower: Amazing\nFrench Onion Soup: Perfect\nSalmon: Flawless\n\nThe service was excellent, as was the ambiance. I'll be back whenever I'm in town!",
   "Our office just had our Christmas lunch at Loukinens' on Fourth and everyone was wowed!  The comments I received back were: outstanding food; above and beyond service; best restaurant we have ever gone to for our Christmas lunch; on and on!  One of our staff had their 2 year old with her and they brought out toys for him to play with and helped entertain him.  Definitely on our list of go-back-to restaurants."

   "The food was amazing. The service was amazing from the moment we walked in the door. The cheesy bread beyond addicting and the cocktails are out of this world. This place seriously is one of the tastiest places I have ever been to. Their salad bar was so yummy and had a great kale Cesar salad. We had such an awesome experience celebrating a birthday, we will definitely be back.",

   "short rib grilled cheese... good moist meat. Completely melted cheese blend and toasted to perfection.  Very solid sandwich, comes with tomato soup for that nostalgic dipping plus a side of fries.  Give it an 8 out of 10. \nSoy ginger salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes... the mashed potatoes were delicious although no hint of wasabi flavor.  The Asian slaw boasts cilantro, which I didn\u2019t taste or see, but still super yummy and full of shaved veggies, salmon was on point, moist and cooked perfectly 7 out of 10 on this dish\nGrapefruit martinis did not disappoint, plus we got a free sample of some their very own home made wines.  Over all very impressed with the atmosphere, service and food.  Ask for Anthony, he was one of the best servers we\u2019ve ever had-start to finish!"

It wasn\u2019t edible so I got pasta with marinara. It was ok. It doesn\u2019t come with anything else so I had a bowl of pasta. Hubby had the seafood spaghetti. Bill was $100. Not worth it but the atmosphere was nice.",
   "Octopus appetizer was to die for. The fresh squid ink pasta w seafood was okay. The pasta itself w sauce was good but I was expecting chunks of seafood not just a few over cooked scallops. It was the end of the night so maybe they were out of seafood but in which case they should've told me. The service was Sooo slow and they only had four tables going... After they told me the kitchen was about to close and I better hurry I waited 15 min to take my order. anther waiter finally came to help me. I wish he stuck as my waiter because I kept waiting for the girl assigned to come back she was super friendly but really not aware. Throughout the night instead of coming to me she would just chit chat off to the side. I'm def coming back for the octopus...that's what's bringing me back. and I'll try something else. My drink sea and smoke..okay...presentation was cool but I guess you don't go to Italian restaurants for the cocktails. I was going to give it a three but I know it has potential and the octopus was awesome and pasta (minus seafood) very good plus cute space and ill give it another shot.",
   "Bravo! Everything about the whole dining experience was excellent - the very friendly and warm welcome, sophisticated service and the main event - the food! Oh the food! Absolutely divine. We were limited on time so we just had shared appetizers but what we had was enough to know that we WILL be returning to experience more Vele! Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.",

   "Service was excellent. Our waitress was amazing. Super nice, boxed up everything for us when we were done and took our picture for date night. The food was excellent. The bread basket is on point and offers a diverse group of different breads to try out. The lobster bisque was really tasty. Altho I am a fan of a little spice in my food, which is what made the bisque have a unique good flavor. The steak was cooked perfectly, it did have a bit much fat on it for my liking but that definitely didn't take away from the excellent flavor and the perfect medium rare cooking of it. We also ordered the hash brown brick. Definitely worth trying. Seasoned really well. Does need ketchup, not because of flavor but because it is dry, in my opinion. Dessert was phenomenal. We chose the Apple cheesecake and 9 layer chocolate cake. They have so many options available. There drink menu is worth sticking around for. They make delicious beverages. I ordered a spicy margarita drink and a filthy Manhattan. All of the flavors of each drink blended just perfectly. We didn't have a single bad thing there. Absolutely look forward to going back. The atmosphere is welcoming and the view over the city is pretty cool, since it is located on the 30th floor. The bar on the other side \"Pinnacle lounge\" I believe is what it's called, is bad. Don't go there. They do not know how to mix a drink properly. The amaretto sour I ordered tasted like weak Dollar general off brand koolaide mixed with pool water. Luckily tho that bar doesn't have anything to do with Nick and Nino's. Def go check out Nick and Nino's for great food, great service, and a romantic atmosphere.",
   "Rick was the kindest, most attentive server I have ever had! He knew every detail about everything on the menu. Complements to the chef because everything was cooked perfectly. It was a joy to be served by Rick and enjoy a perfect evening with delicious food.",
   "Best steak and service in Town",
   "The service and food are excellent, and the atmosphere is unmatched in Springfield.  I would recommend N&N\u2019s for a romantic date night; HOWEVER, be weary of the markup on wines. We were charged $44 for a $10 bottle of moscato (La Perlina).  I understand there\u2019s an up charge for wines in restaurants, but 4.5x the retail price seems a little greedy to me...",
   "Very cozy romantic place to have dinner while looking out over the city. I had the firecracker and grilled shrimp aside my pork steak and my date had the rack of lamb. Everything was delicious and she was pleased too. The waiter was very nice as well."

As for the food I ordered their pad Thai and it was amazingly delicious. The noodles had a distinct taste of garlic and other Asian flavors that wanted you to have more of it. Definitely recommend this place for a nice quiet dinner.",

   "We pre-ordered and paid for Easter dinner. It was to be ready to pick up at noon. I got there at 11:55 am and waited in line until 1:30 pm for food. The food seemed cold and and I asked if it had been setting around long. I was told that I was lucky that I got food at all since it is a pandemic. I also heard the person handing out the food tell another customer that it was not his problem that their order was wrong and take what they could get.  When I got home checked the food, the 4 gravy containers were punctured in the top like some one put their finger through it. There was gravy everywhere. The prime rib was very tough and over done  I think that for $140, it would have been a better experience. \nNo one should patronize them any more.",

The bone in ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium, and the calamari we had as an appetizer was by far the best I've had outside of a coastal city.

This was truly the best dining experience either my wife or I has ever had. Thank you for making our date perfect.",

   "Saputo's has recently become a new favorite of mine. Their salad dressing is superb. Their stuffed manicotti with meatballs is my absolute favorite. The service is always great and the food is hot and tasty. Alfredo is delicious also and definitely homemade. I have not had a restaurant that I have ever craved like I crave Saputo's. Love that place. Hope I can eat there again soon!",
   "The service was excellent. The food was good but did not justify the high price. The marinara sauce was tasty but is rather spicy, which was unexpected and not enjoyable. The linguine with white clam sauce was watery. Not a sauce more like a broth. They packaged our leftovers in leakable containers. When we got home and lifted the bag out of the car the bottom was soaking wet, broke through and the food ended up in my car and on the driveway. Again it was not a bad meal but certainly did not justify the prices.",
   "Dinner was delicious and beautifully served. The table and decorations were love as was the ladies room.  Thank you so much for getting us in an hour before our expected time.\nAlso about a month ago we came and picked up take out for our daughter and grandchildren who were returning to Chicago on the train.  That meal was perfect and deliciously hot when they got to eat it around Lincoln."

   "We usually have a fairly large group when heading to Texas Roadhouse. It doesn't seem to cause any issues for them which is nice. They have many tables setup for large groups and are fast at turning them around. That being said, busy nights like Friday and Saturday you will still likely have a moderate wait. I believe they still offer call ahead to save a spot in the que which is nice. Kick back and enjoy y'all!",
   "Texas roadhouse in general is a family favorite! However this one is a personal favorite! All of their staff is always kind and on top of it! Always feel welcome and well taken care of! Including pictures of their menu because I always love being able to look at that.",
   "The ribs I had were excellent. Very tasty and and done s they should be. My wife's rib eye was a bit tough and not as done s she had ordered. The waiter was good but it took a long time to get an extra condiment.",
   "This place has now been added to our favorite places for dinner! Server, Nicole, was very attentive without being a nuisance. Food was prepared to perfection. Festive atmosphere yet we could talk without screaming. Well worth the wait!",
   "We had a party of 8 guys. They got us in fairly quickly, once seated we got drinks fast. Amanda our server admitted she was only in her first week. The group of guys gave her a hard time and she played right along! She was great! All around I would definitely recommend this place! \nSteaks were all cooked as ordered, food came out in order."

But the line along the west wall and few, few empty wooden chairs tell the story. There still is a wait for  so plan accordingly and when delivered  to the table, you know why this is the cross road of tourist, visitor and government staff.",

I ordered at the counter; potato soup, half a sandwich-chicken salad on whole wheat bread. The soup was excellent good potato flavor, chicken salad was good but void of any real flavor. NOTE: you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table.",
   "Great food sandwiches soups drinks. I worked there years ago, nice people to work for and with. But it's only part time. Had to leave for more hours. Just a great place to eat.",

I am usually a medium spice person and a 3 was just about where I liked it, but am glad I didn\u2019t go higher. Glad they kept my water refilled The Who time. Chicken tandoori was delicious.",

   "Staff has always been friendly. We usually do not get a reservation, however I would strongly suggest it. It was a very busy night when we went. As always the salad bar is by far one of the best things about the place. It is a simple bar but you can load your plate up with about anything you want on a salad. The dressings are all great also. The steaks are always perfect. We always cook them ourselves but their cooks do a fantastic job also. I will usually chat with them while cooking my steak. Will be back for another dinner.",
   "Always friendly staff. Bar is secluded and off from restaurant. Great salad bar for meal. Cooks are great. Fun to cook your own! Great price and quantity as well as quality! Great specials. Never had a bad meal. Great selection!",
   "Casual steakhouse, with tasty steaks! Meals come with a salad bar, baked potato, and Texas toast. It offers the unique opportunity to season and cook your own steak (meat), or let their chef do it for you. I loved the salad bar because I could doctor my potato with all the fixings. And their famous skillet cookie was amazing (as you can tell by the empty skillet)! Absolutely wonderful meal!",
   "Best steaks by far. Nice atmosphere and hot waitresses. The men are kinda hot too!! Be sure and ask for Brooke, she's my favorite, although the entire staff is great!",
   "Too pricey for the less than basic meal.  My husband felt we were at a resurrected Ponderosa.  Atmosphere was not up to speed, the tables and chairs were thrown in of no matching decor.  The most attractive site was the unused grill in the center of the restaurant.  The least attractive was the packaged loaves of basic bread that take out restaurants use.  My husband took me there to celebrate my birthday, I wish we were at our frequent visited seafood joint (Chesapeake).  Scratch the outdated salad bar, Update the settings and never offer swordfish are a few starters for an improvement project.  Match your prices with your products and services, customers deserve better."

Definitely recommend this place.\n The food is more authentic than you will find at most places. Keep this in mind if you prefer American Mexican food or haven't had authentic Mexican food.",
   "This place is absolutely amazing! I'm from San Diego and these tacos and appetizers could compete with anyone who comes from the border! Their fries were as crispy and thick cut as could be, and their Nashville tacos were so spicy and delicious. I would give it a 7/10 on the spiciness scale and it's definitely something that hits you on the back end. I absolutely respect their owner who was out working with the rest of his workers. This is a wonderful taco place. Well worth the price!!!",
   "Whom I believe is the owner or manger. Talked down to me as a customer. Was rude when I wanted to check and make sure my whole TOGO order was in the bag. Was rude when I asked his opinion And never told me there was a charge to have the order placed Togo. Word of mouth is more then any review. The food was good but not original Mexican food.

We could have been content for a bit if she had at least offered to get us some wine BUT 20 MINUTES LATER SHE NEVER RETURNED. NEITHER WILL WE! There are way too many dining choices now in Springfield to take a chance on this place. Too bad...it had possibilities, but don't waste your time and money. BB",

   "Very friendly service and very attentive service, I love it when I never see the bottom of my glass. I ordered something called a horseshoe and was very disappointed. I'm not sure of the idea and why it was created. Maybe, just trying to be different. I would rather have had and open-faced  beef sandwich with fries on the side.\nOther than that was my mistake in ordering it because we are new to the area and like to try new dishes, this was one I could do without.\nNow the restaurant itself was very nice for an Irish pub theme. Enjoyed myself immensely in it's atmosphere and among long time local patrons as well as the employees. I love to see just everyday local people that aren't these picture perfect servers. We're from out west and it seems that unless your tall and leggy and have a perfectly shaped backside, your not going to get hired as a server. Good decision on hiring just normal everyday folks with good attitudes and warm smiles. I will be back, just not for the horseshoe, by the way, my wife, loves the horseshoe.",
   "I got the corned beef pony. The corned beef was thinner than I expected but it was fresh! I think if I get the pony again I would get the hamburger. There was too much cheese on the corned beef for my liking. I think the hamburger would be the perfect thickness for the amount of cheese they serve.",
   "It's one of the most popular restaurants in town for good reason. The horseshoes are the best I have had (and I have tried a ton of them) and they are just consistently good. I have had the same order here for 17 years because of that. There is usually a wait to be seated when I come but the kitchen gets food out fast so they turn around tables pretty rapidly so you don't have to wait super long. If you like buffalo chicken definitely get the horseshoe of it with the spicy cheese sauce because it is the best thing on the menu.",
   "Fast food time with 5 start quality dinner, and very friendly staff, please remember even if you pick up your order to tip the workers in these rough times they still get the same pay as if you went inside to eat. The kid who brought out my food almost cried i gave him a $5 tip as i was the only person who left a tip this week",
   "I discovered this place on a road trip a few years ago and now it is my stop for lunch if I go by. I live in Michigan and would drive here monthly if I could. Their horse shoes and ponies are delightful. They are melt in your mouth comfort food. I recommend this place to anyone especially if your looking for the shoes. Line can be long, either wait or sit at the bar."

The menu has items from Curate and VELE, and if you haven\u2019t tried it yet, I highly recommend. \n\nWe typically do not like carry out from anywhere, so at first were a little suspect about how the food would be \u201cto-go,\u201d but the way they package the food actually carried extremely well from restaurant to house and it was all still hot. They put all of their sauces and garnishes in little containers on the side so nothing gets soggy or out of place (even the dishes that come on top of their awesome mashed potatoes!), and the fish and chips is something we probably would never order at the restaurant, but we got it to go last night and it was insanely good\u2014still crispy and hot by the time we got home!",

   "This is one of those restaurants that has been in Springfield for ages. There is a reason it has lasted so long and is one of the city's favorite places to eat steak and lobster. The food and atmosphere are good, and I always enjoy my time at the Old Lux.",
   "Food was delicious and very good size portions. Steak was juicy and tender. Good atmosphere and staff was friendly",
   "Waitress was overwhelmed with too many tables.  Fried Chicken was a lot of breading and so crispy hard to bite in to.  Steaks looked good.  Tried my husband steak it was tasty.",
   "This is a great place to get a steak dinner! Very friendly staff and the place has a cozy atmosphere. I was just a bit disappointed that they don\u2019t have beer on tap."

   "My husband and I recently visited to this place and we both love this place. This is going to be our little gem. He got cheese ravioli with tomato Alfredo sauce with a side of Caesar salad. Ravioli was amazing even though we couldn't say the same for the salad. It wasn't terrible. But It was average Caesar salad. I got Italian sausage sandwich with a side of fries. First of all fries were spectacular! So crispy and fluffy. I love their sausage as well. Well spiced! Over all, I will most definitely return to this place to try other foods.",

   "I have been to Osaka many times over the last year.  This experience was not as good as the previous visits.  We went with some co-workers for lunch.  I ordered the lunch special with two sushi rolls. One of the rolls was semi warm instead of the typical cold temperature.  The service was mediocre and someone in the kitchen shrieked loudly like there was something wrong. Overall it was alright but it seems like the restaurant is starting to get dated and there are patched marks on the walls. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town.  The food is generally really good but for the price I think the restaurant could use some updating and maybe a fresh coat of paint.  I realize the aesthetics are not everything but I feel like it is all part of going to a nicer restaurant.",
   "Glen B. @ the Sushi bar is the ONLY reason we gave 5 stars! His ability to carry a conversation,awesome personality & his amazing IMAGINATION with making the most tastiest rolls!!  I'm glad we stopped in, Thanks Glen!!!!",
   "We had a birthday here, and the service is the best I've had from a restaurant. Not only were all of the waiters and cooks friendly, their professionalism with how they did everything from helping me order vegan at the hibachi grill to how they came out with the cupcakes we brought with a sparkling candle all impressed me. I'd definitely recommend Osaka to anyone interested in some of the best Japanese food and service in the area.",
   "The food is outstanding!! From start to finish the presentation and flavor are to die for. Great drinks and atmosphere as well as family friendly. We had the best waitress in the entire place! Daphne is absolutely amazing and I will always make sure to request one of her tables, I suggest you do the same!!",

   "There were four of us for dinner. and our server and the food were both excellent. I had the rib-eye, and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. My wife had several vegetable dishes. the others in our party had chicken tender and chopped  steak. The portions were large, and they both took some home. We've been here several times, and it's always been good.",
   "We were up in Springfield for a getaway weekend and Springfield Char House was recommended highly.  Being near the hotel we were staying at, we decided to give this restaurant a try.\n\nIt was an early Saturday evening and the restaurant was not very busy; however, we were pointedly seated and left with menus.  The menu, rather the selection of menu items, was probably the best part of our experience.  After a few minutes, our server emerged to ask for our beverage selection and to see if we were ready to select our entrees.  Instead, we requested an appetizer with our drinks.\n\nA short time later, our server brought our drinks and took our order.  I chose the Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken Breast, and my wife chose the Tuscan Chicken.  A few minutes later, she returned with our salads.  A few minutes into our salads, our server returned with our entrees as well as our appetizer.\n\nIn the short span of fifteen minutes (after the initial wait for a server), we had our entrees in front of us...we barely had the opportunity to finish our salads.  Our entrees were quite hot, but the appetizer (potato skins) were not; besides, we had our entrees...we no longer needed or wanted the appetizer.  Our entrees were good, but somewhat bland. \n\nIn passing, our server asked one time \"is everything tasting alright\" to which our answer went unheard as she scurried away.  She did not return to refill our drinks; she only returned to ask if we wanted boxes and to present our check.  In all fairness, the guy cleaning tables was more diligent and attentive.\n\nI would hope our experience was the result of an unfortunate \"off\" night for the server/restaurant.  Still, I'm not going to give Springfield Char House another try.  I think 2 stars out of 5 is being generous.",
   "Waited 1 1/2 to find our food order was lost. Steak had no flavor but shrimp was good. Beer was cold.",
   "Simple American fare place with great service. Menu has a lot to choose from. The fried chicken was very good as well as the ribs. Ambience seems a little dated but overall not a bad place. Will go there again.",
   "Good food, could taste every ingredient. Had the Philly, Fries and salad with a sweet tea. Faster food than some fast food places I've been. Place was clean and staff were friendly. Prices were reasonable."

   "This is a hidden gem that I was fortunate enough to trip over while traveling for work.\n\nIs attached to a small truck stop and convenience store.  The bathrooms for the convenience store are what is available as a restaurant customer so that's slightly awkward, but no big deal.\n\nIt appears to be locally owned and operated by many of the family members.  The menu has a great selection of typical American fare.  The price points are very reasonable.\n\nI ordered a steak dinner, and the steak was cooked a little further than I ordered but was still a pleasant bite.  The soup and sides were good and the portions were fair.  after I had ordered my steak I looked up and saw a specials board that listed pork chops done a half a dozen different ways.  Had I seen that first I would have ordered them instead.\n\nI'm going to have to go back there and try the breakfast sometime!",

The food is good, wouldn't say its exceptional, but definitely good.  I tried their Popeye Omelette and enjoyed it.",

Also the fried green beans were super tasty. The tomato soup was a little watery, but not enough to knock a star off the rating. All four of us enjoyed our visit, not just because of the food, but the friendly staff as well. Good job Abe's Hideout!",

Our server was attentive and friendly we had no issues. We would definitely go back to this place again if we are ever in the area may even make a trip to do so",

There was plenty of room for us to spread out. We were only a party of ten, so I didn't call ahead but they easily accommodated us.  Amazingly the single waitress for our table kept up and then some with all our food and drink orders and refilled everything so quickly it felt like there were 5 waitresses for our party.

Waitress was okay but seemed preoccupied with her cleaning or whatever it was up front. The food took a long time, likely due to the group. My steak was supposed to be medium well, was med rare at best, cool in the center still. Our waitress had vanished again so we asked a guy if he could get her. He turned his head and kept walking. Literally sat looking at a rare steak forever before some random lady asked us if we needed help with it and took ot back to the kitchen to bring it up to temp. Came back in the same condition it left except they had switched out the plate and potato. Brought home a $30 steak for my dog. Won't be back.",
   "Used curbside ordering and ordered Medium, also confirmed 2 times \u201cmedium pink center \u201c when got it it was fully cooked like a piece of wood. Taste was great though, but chewy and low quality. I will give it a chance under normal condition.",

   "1st time here, nice place in downtown Springfield. Staff very friendly. They had a casual side with a few booths and a walk up counter for carry outs. Then the next room is a nice dinning area. 1st impression is good. Seated and given menus, drink orders placed. Menu is nice with the main options being pasta dishes or what appears to be nice hand tossed pizzas. Orders placed, food received. My thoughts as they brought out the salad was they put a lot into a small bowl. The main course looked and tasted really good. As a side note the portion sizes are probably what you should be receiving, a regular size (not large) serving. Food & service was great but not nearly as good as the cannoli cake. Definitely give this place a try.",
   "Definitely worth a visit if you are willing to brave downtown traffic for lunch. The lunch menu was affordable and the portion size was good for the price. The spaghetti and meatballs and cream of potato soup I ordered even came with some delicious fresh baked bread! The thing that topped it all off though was the black cherry gelato I got for a dessert, it was super satisfying and perfect. The staff was super friendly and attentive as well. We intend to come back and try the dinner menu in the future.",
   "I can believe I didn't get any photos but I had a great pizza margarita there.  Very fresh, sauce with mozzarella and basil.  The crust was perfect a little crunchy and chewy.  I was visiting a friend in Springfield and had just stopped in for a quick bite.  I hope to go back and try some pasta and desserts. Promise to get photos next time, LOL.",
   "First time for dinner and was very happy with our selections. I had the lasagna and my husband had the cannelloni; both were excellent! The sauce very much reminded me of my aunt's - delicious. Will definitely return with our family.",
   "I think I should've looked at the pictures rather than read the reviews before going. I was really excited about fig and prosciutto pizza but what I got was a layer of cheese thicker than the crust. And not even cheesy. Really took away from any flavor. The polpette appetizer was good I just wish it was brought out hotter. It was lukewarm. Bread it came with was really really good. The meatballs are the reason this was a 3 and not a 2. Drinks are very reasonably priced. Service was great and friendly."

   "Better than most pub food. Horseshoes are very good (according to my wife and son). This trip I chose the chopped chef salad and it was great. Pepsi products are only $2 - a rare find these days.  This was our third trip and have never been disappointed.",
   "Try their egg rolls. Crazy good spin on a classic dish. Above average craft beer selection. Convenient location.",
   "Excellent service very good food and reasonable prices.  I had the bacon cheeseburger and homemade chips.  Both were excellent, cooked to perfection and delivered to the table fast and hot.",
   "Brickhouse is a very popular place to dine in or just have a few drinks. The atmosphere is very active and upbeat. The food is great... every time I have eaten there I have been happy with my order. \ud83d\ude0a\nI can't forget to mention the wait staff, which has been nothing but excellent, even when the place is hopping. I would definitely go back and suggest that you check them out too.",

   "Amazing lunch menu. Different! Been there multiple times and every meal has been excellent. Love the ambiance",
   "Worst meal ever on New Year's Eve. We had a reservation for a group of 10 @7pm, flags should have been raised when it appeared as if there was only one bartender.  We were seated at our table which had no place settings and was served water immediately, shortly after, our waiter took drink orders. It took quite some time to be served our drinks since the room was starting to fill up with other diners.  We had a limited menu to order from which is understandable on an anticipated busy night.  Once we were served, we had no butter or sour cream on the table for anyone's baked potatoes, no salt and pepper and one meal of pork chops was served completely raw inside. The pork was sent back, and other meals had steamed veggies that were more raw than steamed. \nIt appeared for whatever reason the place was understaffed.  Our waiter did try to take care of us but appeared as if he was being rushed. The manager comped the one meal that was sent back. We were disappointed in this visit as it was the 1st time most of us have been here. We are understanding enough to give them another chance for another visit on an evening with no special events.",
   "Expensive. Steaks were good but over priced compared to elsewhere in town. Cesar salad was funky and not at all classic taste. Atmosphere was ok but too bright.",
   "Biggest lobster tail I've ever had && so delicious!",
   "Was a great atmosphere! Sat at the Blu bar during happy hour, was not very busy but service was great. \nOrdered soup and an appetizer and both were delicious. Fast service! \nWill definitely be back!"

Place is on the smaller size very clean with pleasing decor. Staff is friendly and outgoing. I have enjoyed this place on numerous occasions and have never not had a good experience with the dishes I've tried. Delicious.",
   "First time here but my sister and her husband loved there food first . Walking in it's nice the walls make you feel like your in Hawaii and the smell of the good is yummy . Having tried Pad tai in many locations this definitely had good pad tai well seasoned hot and spicey . You can pick what spice level you want too and it actually comes out how you request . The pho is great and well portioned and flavorful as well . The appetizers are so food as well we got crab rangoon which  where nice and cheesy with crab meat and the dumbling  where to die for!! The pad tai rolls where crunchy and came with sauce to dip them in and oh so yummy. I have to say I will be returning here next time I'm in the area!!",

   "This was our first time here.  Right from the start she told us how you order.  If you never been there, ask for help!  It makes a difference.  She was extremely helpful.\n\nYou pick your seafood (shrimp, snow or king crab, mussels, etc), pick a side, pick your boil and then pick your spice.  Spice I highly recommend Anchors Away as it was just enough hotness you need that doesnt over power the food.\n\nWhile we had our drinks, she gave us a sample of grits.  I am not a grit-guy but tried it anyway, but boy theirs was great!\n\nAs you see below, everything is served in a bag.  Expect it to be messy!!!  Normally I see it in a bucket or in a net, but I like this idea as it still marinates in the bag.\n\nThe food was awesome.  I had the shrimp and snow crabs.  Now it is my favorite seafood place.  No parking in front of place but there is other street parking and a huge parking garage on the east side.\n\nFat Tuesday is coming up so that will be fun to enjoy.",
   "We arrived at 6:20 pm. We Ordered an appetizer and 4 meals. We waited almost an hour for the appetizer and sat for an additional hour without being served our meals. During these two hours our waiter failed to say two words to us or explain what was taking so long. We watched people who arrived after us eat and leave. So we got up and left to get dinner elsewhere. Then our waiter decided he better come actually speak to us, just to scream down the street he was calling the cops if we didn\u2019t pay for our 6 alligator bites we ordered as an appetizer. We walked back inside to give him 12 dollars but we will never ever be going back. The discount we deserved for waiting 2 hours without hardly being looked at by the staff should have been worth well over 12 dollars. Awful service. Possibly worst service I\u2019ve ever gotten at an eating establishment.",
   "We went as a group of 6. Everyone tried a different item. From frog legs to crab... shrimp to oysters... everyone loved the food. Prices were reasonable.  Service was good. Too bad the Municipal League next door are such bad neighbors. Parking is challenging but worth a one block walk.",
   "Great food choices and delicious meals.  Kind servers and attentive. Gumbo pictured was slightly spicy, which was exactly what I wanted. My wife ordered the shrimp and grits and it was amazing. A must visit for those in the area.",
   "First time...nice and pleasant atmosphere. Food was good. I will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu."

My wife had a margherita  flatbread pizza that was large enough to take half of it home. I had the prime rib with mashed potatoes and southwest corn.  It was good but a little too well done for my taste. I didn't send it back, not wanting to waste it. Dessert was a delicious chocolate that we shared. We had an excellent server.",

While he was there, a busboy emerged from a stall, CARRYING a tray full of dishes, and left the restroom without washing his hands.   Pointed the busboy out and complained to the waitress who promised to speak to a manager.  At least one other customer witnessed this.\n\nWe won't be back.",

   "Being from an urban area, the atmosphere brought us back to some of the places we regularly visited in our younger years. The itamae is definitely a sushi master. He is creative but maintains a balance in his pieces. The French Kiss roll is delightfully refreshing with a slight lemon pucker inside. The Sunny roll has a hint of sweetness from the mango while still being a savory roll. The tempura rolls are crunchy. The rice is tender. And the hostess, Jessica, provides a calming spirit to a busy restaurant. It was our anniversary and the chef sent us a complementary appetizer, which was a thoughtful surprise. We will definitely return and I might stop in just for the House Salad, with a creamy ginger house dressing.",
   "Best sushi place in Springfield! Honestly we were surprised! We are sushi lovers and find sushi places in any city. I found Happy Sushi in yelp as 4.5 stars, they deserve it. Good for their business! Pick yummy and anger management rolls! They rock!",
   "If you read my reviews, you know I\u2019m into sushi. This is by far my favorite place to get sushi in Springfield. It definitely has that hole in the wall vibe, but the sushi is divine. Also try the heart attack jalape\u00f1o appetizer. That was surprisingly really good.",

   "I took my best friend today for the curbside pickup for lunch. It was her first visit to Bella Milano. I ordered my all time favorite the Chicken Gouda and she had the kids hamburger with bacon and cheese. As she was eating she couldn\u2019t help but say \u201cOh my goodness I need to report a robbery, they just stole my heart.\u201d 5 stars for the great food and service. Thanks for all that you guys do there at Bella Milano :)",
   "Let me start with the service was excellent.  That\u2019s about all that was good here. We came down from Chicago to check out Springfield and were looking for some good Italian food.  This was a swing and a miss. Our appetizer calamari was greasy chewy and flavorless, the presentation was terrible as well. Our salads were over dressed and soggy, though if the texture wasn\u2019t horrible, the taste profile was actually decent.  They give you some store bought bread and oil with cheese. The oil tasted like vegetable oil, it had no flavor it was awful.  My entree was chicken Marsala, it was nothing even close to Marsala, bland and flavorless it was a half chicken breast cutlet cut in half.. $22 for a half a chicken breast is crazy.     All that said the pasta carbonara was actually good. Maybe they\u2019re good at pasta, but everything else was less than mediocre.",
   "We made reservations here for a celebratory dinner. It was busy, but we were seated promptly. My wife had a vegetarian pasta, and I ordered sea bass and scallops. My wife had soup; I had a small Milano salad. Both were excellent, as were our entrees. It's easy to overcook fish,  but it was perfect. Our server was exceptionally good although she had a seemingly large number of tables. It's always a pleasure to dine here, and this was no exception.",
   "I have been here several times. The food is good and the service is also good. The toasted ravioli is really yummy. \n\nThere is a lunch menu that has less expensive prices of you go at lunch time. \n\nIt's a pretty big space that has lots of room for dinners and the parking lot had room for all the cars.\n\nWent on Monday and they had $5 drinks and appetizers. So I got to have  toasted ravioli for less money.",
   "We did not have reservations and the wait was 30-40 minutes, not bad for a Friday night. We ordered mixed drinks and they were very good. When we ordered we were asked if we refer soup or salad so we made our choices. We did not know this wasn\u2019t included in the meal price until we got the ticket and it was an added charge. The food was very good. We were first timers so the general manager came and talked to us and gave us a voucher good for a free pasta dish in the future. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Food was very good and the restaurant was very clean even though they were very busy."

   "I had a horrible experience at this restaurant. The service was terrible and racist. My date and I are both Black and it was very apparent that the poor service we received was racially motivated. The rest of the patrons in the restaurant were White and received better service than us. I made a reservation hours in advance, but it took them at least 10 minutes to get a table prepared for us, despite the fact that multiple tables were open and we arrived 10 minutes before the time of our reservation. The table they prepared was located in the back corner of the restaurant between the exit door and one of the windows. It was very cold and the most secluded spot in the restaurant. There were other tables for two available, but the waiter chose to seat us there. After taking us to our seat, the waiter served us water and did not offer any other drinks. Also, we were not given any snacks while waiting for our food. Patrons who came after us were given these snacks while waiting for their food. The waiter took 10 minutes to give us menus despite having ample time to do so. This would have been somewhat understandable had there been many people in the restaurant at the time, but that was not the case. After giving us menus, the waiter took another 15 minutes to check on us about our order. It took 50 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. We both ordered simple main course dishes that did not require any kind of special preparations. At least three other tables with patrons that arrived after us received their food before we did. Our visit to this restaurant lasted around two hours, and we were checked on only once, not including the mandatory visits the waiter made to our table to give us our menus, food, and the check. The rest of the patrons were checked on regularly. I always tip at restaurants, but I did not give a tip on this occasion due to my awful experience. I will never return to this restaurant, nor will I ever recommend others to visit it, especially people of color.",

All the food is very well marked and the owner is ready to answer any questions. They have a Vegan Festival in April and other Vegan events throughout the year.",
   "Catered our daughter's wedding and the food was delicious. Many of the people were from out of town and even out of country. All enjoyed the selection. Grateful for their friendly, laid-back demeanor. Their restaurant is the go-to place for Indian cuisine in Springfield.",
   "This is by far the best place to go out to dinner in Springfield. The atmosphere is amazing, the staff is excellent, and the food... THE FOOD IS BEYOND AMAZING. Check out the lunch buffet as well, it's worth every penny and then some. If I could rate more than 5 stars i would. Bravo Gateway.",
   "Great food. Confused servers. They forgot to bring white rice with a couple dishes. Also ordered a bottle of Cabernet. Smooth"

   "Went for the 217 hamburger special.  It was a delicious burger.  Would have given 5 stars but we waited quite a while to get our order taken.  But after that all was good!  And when I called in the afternoon had an exceptional gal on the phone.  She was super nice!",
   "Great food good service great atmosphere. I recommend getting onion rings for an appetizer.",
   "Excellent service. Great food.",
   "Waitress was nice, but almost never came back to the table to check on us. Disappeared after paying even though my family stayed to chat. Horseshoe fries were cold and the tater tots were warm, making it obvious that they weren't made at the same time. Fries were old and inedible. The cheese sauce was frothy, and the tenderloin was chewy and over seasoned.",
   "Nice place. Happy hour for apps. Beer garden. Clean. We had a party of 12 with all sorts of needs (seperate checks, coupled checks, I'll get his drink, food only, drink only, food and drink) and everything was spot on. Our waitress Casey was great."
