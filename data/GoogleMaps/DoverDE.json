   "Our son is very interested in law enforcement and this was a cool place to visit. You don't need a lot of time to go through the exhibits. It's free to get in and the kids had fun exploring the different parts of the museum. It has about 2 large rooms housing various police equipment and paraphernalia from decades past. The bonus was that it's only 15 min from the Air Mobility Command Museum so we did both I'm one day.",
   "An excellent history of Deleware State Troopers.  All sorts of equipment uniforms guns and even vehicles.  Well laid out and includes some interactive displays",
   "What a wonderful tribute to our Delaware State Troopers. The museum is outstanding. Everyone should spend some time there and thank our police for their  dedication.",
   "This museum is free and definitely worth the visit. Some of the interactive items are broken, but it doesn't take away from the allure.",
   "This was great place to visit. Very interesting. We had lots if fun"

   "Went for a private tour on a rainy Monday morning. Wasn't expecting much but boy I was wrong! We had a blast. Our tour guide told us in great detail the story of the speedway, he showed us the different areas and even took us for a lap on the track in his own car, we also walked part of the track and saw the high angle that thing has. We also went to the media room and saw how everything there works on race day. If you love Nascar or car racing in general this is a must.",
   "Drinks and food 2 expensive.  Mainly the band club. Lower the drink prices. The patrons will get out of there gambling chair and watch the entertainment. Food is awesome but the casino ask the restaurants the pay to much in rental fees. My understanding is greed. Spend more as a patron and pay more as a food service along with any business who wants business in there casino. Just because you provide a service in a casino. Dont give the casinos the right to charge more outrageous rental space to the food beverage and other businesses providers. You attract more businesses if you keep prices fair. But casinos are all about gr\u00f7ed. The division sign is to prove is it worth it.",
   "Not every pull of the lever leads to a win. I enjoyed this \"play place \". Very well lit. It didn't feel like they tried to cram as many machines and people as they could in there. AND I took my money back home with me! WINNING!!",
   "Had a fun time there and stayed in a room for the evening.  Nice accommodations.  Big selection of slots. Going again this month for my anniversary.  Wish me luck \ud83d\udc4c",
   "This speedway is pretty fantastic and will make for an awesome day of NASCAR. The parking is expansive and yes, you may need to walk a distance, but it\u2019s worth it. For an event, there usually are food trucks and activities for customers. The stadium seating is like any other, so if you suffer from back pain, I would bring a cushion. The bathrooms are well maintained."

   "My boyfriend and I have been wanting to come here for awhile.  For our Valentine's weekend I planned the trip and didn't tell him.  When we got there,  we both were so excited as we both love planes.  We enjoyed the museum greatly!  It was amazing to think that we were in planes that were used so long ago.  The history and knowledge were incredible.  ED R. was our tour guide and he was excellent (and funny).  This was one of the greatest adventures we've done and it was FREE! We can't wait to go back to see more!",
   "I went here for father\u2019s day as my dad loves aviation history. There is an inside and outside part to the museum, both offering large collections of planes to look at. Inside, a guide kindly let us into one of the planes and taught us about the history of the plane as well as it\u2019s role in the war and how it came to the museum. Outside, there are several planes that you can go in and explore. Easy day trip if you\u2019re in the area!",
   "What a small but mighty gem! The volunteers are just as much a part of the museum as the dozens of historic planes. They live and love the work they do and so many of them are veterans with a passion to share stories. The personnel of their own accord kindly showed me and a friend around the place and through different planes, answering questions expertly. \n\nThe curators left finges of sass and humor throughout that really just makes an enjoyable experience. It was very worth the two-hour drive from DC/NOVA and I would love to come back on their monthly Saturday event where all 40+ planes are opened to enter!",
   "LOVED coming here. Kevin really made our visit special and took us round lots of planes, including photos and detailed accounts of the history of some of the planes there. There's an impressive array of sites, as well as simulators! \nDefinitely plan on returning with more time and family. Thank you Kevin!",
   "Great place to go for families to learn about our history. Our four kids loved all of the airplanes and interactive stations. They especially loved the flight simulator where they got to land an airplane themselves and \"earn their wings\" sticker \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d"

   "Nice little museum highlighting Delaware's agricultural history. Run by caring people and volunteers. I was there for A Farmer's Christmas,  an annual event. If you're wanting bright, shiny and upscale, this isn't that type of place. But if you're interested in learning about the agricultural  history of the state, this is a wonderful place to visit. The displays and facilities are carefully and thoughtfully maintained by dedicated staff and volunteers. This museum is small town America at best.",
   "Nice place to go spend a Summer day to keep the kids occupied.  There is not a lot of stuff they can touch and play with inside so depending on how young your kids are, it might not be ideal.  My girls loved feeding the pig who is super social and calm.  You also can actually go into the chickens little fenced in coop area and feed them as well.  My daughter ended up with chicken poop all over her but it made for a nice laugh after her brief meltdown lol.  The woman who was working there was SUPER nice.  The school house bell is fun to ring for the kids too.  They enjoy exploring the historic village outside.",
   "Excellent museum showing early farm life in Delaware.   Includes some historic buildings that have been brought to the property.  Lots of history of local folks who helped Delaware to grow and prosper.",
   "Bought back a lot of fun memories.  Watching my Uncle  Jim and his family working on their farms as a child in up State New York.  Learned about more of the process I didn't know about as well\n  Very friendly help full staff",

The house and grounds are so interesting.  We love learning about peoples' everyday lives from that period.  Our guide, Chris, was knowledgeable and interesting.  He welcomed all our questions (and we had  many).  He answered all of them and we learned so much.  The video beforehand was quite useful.   The ladies at the Welcome Center were also full of information about John Dickinson and his life.",
   "I grew up in Delaware but had never been here for a tour.  It was an awesome tour.  The tour guides were terrific especially young Tyler.",
   "Been there twice. Once with school and the other time with my fianc\u00e9e. It is free and they do accept donations. It is beautiful. Mostly all the info is correct. They do events.",
   "The guides were very knowledgeable and wonderful.  However i wish they would recomend an age that children should be to enjoy things like this.  The children were very behaved but pretty much board to death.",
   "Immerse in Delaware and American history while visiting this well preserved plantation. The whole visit with the house tour doesn't take more than an hour and a half. Definitely watch the video in the barn."

   "This was such a fantastic museum, and I'd have to say the best \"museum\" experience I've had in a long time! The guide gave lots of extra information and stories compared to if I had gone through the museum on my own. She played some records on some of the older pieces they had, and it was enchanting. I'd go back in a heart beat!",

It was a fabulous experience for the entire group of people that we were traveling with.",

   "This is a beautiful building.  The staff were very friendly and gave a great tour.",
   "Great little building full of history and both the guides were excellent, providing details and stories",
   "Stopped in for a tour and was so impressed by the young woman who gave us a tour! The building itself is magnificent, but the enthusiasm and knowledgeability of the tour guide made the experience so incredible. Tours are offered on demand as soon as you walk in, so no need to schedule a time or come in on the hour (however, the walking tour, which is separate from the state house tour, leaves on the hour). Overall I had a great time here and would recommend it to anyone! (No public restrooms in the building, but there is one available nearby at the art museum. Plenty is parking available both in front of the state house itself and on the side streets nearby.)"

By far, the Biggs Museum was our favorite.  There was an Audobon exhibit when we were there along with pagers from children's books. I intend to go back soon. The exhibits change often. I'm not sure of the entrance price as I got us a Groupon, but didn't need it. Pro tip: The first Saturday of every month is free",

Amish is mainly vendors that sell it and they know what they're doing! There's also shopping in the back. Anything from clothes to personal hygiene products for reasonable prices.",
   "Super crowded and busy, but it is expected when you visit during lunch time. The pretzel booth is definitely a must-try. There's  plenty of homemade goods. Most of the items are sold and made by either Amish people or Mennonites. You will see most with thwir traditional garments as they cook and sell their items.",
   "Same as it was when I came 35 years ago. I call them the original amazon. Great deals you can catch some very good merchandise during the auction. If you need some quick cash minus all the Haggling bring your treasures log them with office  and let Spencers sell all your stuff. 2 hours later come collect your cash. Also the Farmers market has some awesome food. Homemade Ice cream cakes and pies. Hot food made by Amish very good.\nNice outing Tuesday Friday auction days",
   "Spence's Bazaar has been a WONDERFUL place to visit FOR MORE YEARS THAN I CAN COUNT!!!  I sojourn there as often as I possibly can!  \n\nThe Amish foods (donuts, meats, ice creams, desserts, candies, etc., etc.,) are SUPER EXCELLENT ~ as expected!!!  \n\nI've  purchased more foods, fruits, vegetables; tomato/pepper plants; fresh, LARGE strawberries; jewelry, hair jewelry/items; clothing and shoes [new and used]; comforters, ALTOGETHER CAPTIVATING blankets and SO, SO, SO MANY OTHER NOVELTY ITEMS at Spence's Bazaar than I can possibly EVER COUNT! \n\nEveryone should visit Spence's.  Just ONE TRIP to that place and you'll be captivated for life.  My hubby and I went there when we were just married 38 years ago, and we've remained faithful, loyal patrons ever since. We've known some of the vendors for many, many years (and some of them are truly WONDERFUL, AMAZING, AWESOME PEOPLE).  \n\nIt was burned down by some arsonist juveniles a number of years ago and the owners were uncertain of rebuilding; however, the merchants of Dover, DE, (possibly some of the vendors themselves\u300a?\u300b) and/or citizens got together and decided that THIS PLACE was too important ~ REPEAT, TOO CRITICAL TO LOSE, so they got together and it was rebuilt (Who did it exactly?  I do NOT KNOW).  I won't presume and/or pretend that I do!\n\nThere are many different vendors who rely on sales from Spence's. Those of us who are clients rely on it/them as well.  What an AWESOME PLACE TO VISIT!!! I highly recommend it to EVERYONE.  It's truly phenomenal.",

   "The most interesting thing about the Governor's Mansion is the fact that it is so accessible! If the governor is not present, you can walk by the house and in the governor's gardens. The perks to living in such a small state. \n\nThe mansion itself is in Georgian style, and it is so inconspicuous that unless there was a sign that said \"Governor's Mansion,\" you would probably just assume that it was a cool old house. The Mansion is on the National Register of Historic Places, so drive by, snap a picture, and see if you can stroll by the gardens.",
   "Food is good, price is great an the place has a relaxing feel of spring time",
   "I e-mailed twice inquiring about a tour. No response. I show up in person during the posted open hours and it's closed up. 3 employees outside completely ignored me. Very disappointing. The gardens are lovely, though.",

A nice reception building with small exhibits and clean bathrooms.  Easy to navigate on the roads.  A definitely great place for birdwatchers and anyone who enjoys wildlife.  When I visited years ago in November flocks of thousands of snow geese would impress anyone.",
   "Beautiful! Peaceful! We were too early in the season to watch migratory fowl but we did see some geese and ducks nonetheless.  Ruts on the wildlife drive but we saw that BH is getting ready to mitigate that situation. Should be absolutely gorgeous in a couple of weeks.",
   "A great place to see native and migratory bird species. Herons, egrets, goldfinch, indigo bunting, geese, terns, and even a red fox makes the rounds and poses for pics. Yes, during summer there are lots of biting flies but around August they start to die down. We wear long sleeves and a hat to step out of the car and snap photos. Very friendly people here that are usually happy to discuss birding and sharing photos.",

They informed us before they fed the pelicans and took a tortoise out of its enclosure so my 5 year-old and I could watch and pet it.  I also learned so much from Dan about the animals.\nWhen my daughter asked to pet one of the snakes, the gentleman stopped what he was doing to go and get a snake for her.  It was a great time and we are already talking about going back.",

Their parking area had a srterp drop off so when I pulled out of the lot slowly it tore up the front end of my vehicle.

It doesn't exactly dispel the notion that youth sports are all about making money.",

I have been to lots of places for tournaments and this is the best so far. 12 turf fields with plenty of grassy areas nearby each field for team warmups and teams to set up tents. Wide sidewalks connect access to all fields and parking was fairly easy. Multiple concession stands throughout with restrooms and working water fountains at each one. There are also plenty of trees planted around sidewalk and  end fields to provide shade. There is also a picnic sheltering the center area.

   "Frightland is truly an incredible experience. I've been to many haunted attractions on the east coast, and I can say that Frightland ranks as one of the highest in terms of quality, quantity, and value. The set designs are amazing. The actors are engaging. The scares are genuinely TERRIFYING and top-notch. They have some of the most creative and unique hayride sets that I have ever encountered... I could go on. It's been a long time since a haunt made me jump so much! In comparison to other haunts in the area, Frightland gives you the most for your money with 8 full attractions as well as a full carnival midway (and rides are included with your ticket purchase). The lines do get long at Frightland (because they try their absolute best the make sure that you don't run into the group in front of you). This makes the experience much more enjoyable and personal (as well as much scarier!). You may have to wait a while, but I guarantee you the experience is well worth it! Frightland will be on my list every Halloween season from now on!",
   "An absolute place that you must visit! \ud83d\ude00 Frightland is easily a traditional and favorite place to visit every year.",
   "Great actors! Good scares! Lacks a little in ambiance.",
   "I\u2019ve been to Frightland 3 years in a row about to be 4 and it never fails to disappoint \ud83d\ude01 all the low reviews about the staff being mean and rude, never happened when I was there all 3 years. The website tells you everything you need to know about going, so don\u2019t say that it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s always gonna be mainly jump scares, there\u2019s not really any other way to terrify people lol. Plus they change something or add something every single year so one bad year shouldn\u2019t stop you from coming. They made the hayride longer and added new Ghouls. I highly recommend this place. Every time I\u2019ve gone, the food has been good. And people are going to cut in line, you\u2019re just gonna have to suck it up. If you want to make it to all the attractions, start with the hayride and you will be fine. I highly recommend starting with the hayride. The first year I didn\u2019t and didn\u2019t make it to all of them. The two years after that, I started with the hayride and made it to all attractions both times. Most of the money goes to a good cause so you\u2019re not wasting it.  Go. To. Frightland!",
   "Had an awesome time here tonight! The hayride was a little disappointing in the beginning, but every other attraction killed it! You will not regret spending those $40, go for it and definitely do all 8 attractions, best bang for the buck."

   "First time of going but compared to Dover Downs Casinos I can say that Harrington Casino the payout is higher but they offer very little comp money or really cool free stuff based on the points you have accumulated from playing the slots during that month. They also don't offer much free play. When you play the slots in Dover they offer free slot play once you have accumulated some points and they also offer 25.00 in free slot play when you join to be used the very first day only and then ever few months they may offer anywhere from 15.00 to 50.00 in free slot play. You also get either 2 free night stay for 2 at the casino hotel or percentage off at their spa. So to me even though Harrington pays out more you get more bang for your buck and more incentives at Dover Downs casino and raceway.",

There's a band playing in the club if your only interested in great music.  Upstairs is sports being and poker. I play poker and I'm there for hours ago they provide comfortable seats in there as well as in the shorts being area.  The food is great as well all you can eat in certain area's of the casino.",

   "I have been to this park every year since I moved to Delaware.  This years experience was the worst mainly due to the bathrooms and shower house.  They were completely disgusting!  Not only were they nasty...they were just plain unsanitary.  There are 100 plus people using these everyday and they weren't even cleaned once that I could tell.  There was a wait for my wife and daughter to use the bathhouse every time.  They really need to build new larger and more sanitary facilities.  I found it ironic that a sign out side the bathhouse said to pick up after your pets because it's unsanitary.  How about cleaning the bathrooms!  Geez, for $35 a night I think the hosts could do a better job and making sure they were at least hosed out.  \n\nAnother reason I disliked this trip was because the WWII tower was closed/locked with no explanation all weekend???  That is one of the reasons I like to go there.  Bike trails are nice.  Beach is very crowed and the only place to go with a dog is to the truck beaches and we almost got run over by trucks on the way out!  C'mon Delaware authorities.  98% of the people on the truck beaches are not fishing!  They are partying!  I think it should be a little more enforced as to the regulations for preservation of the beaches.  JMHO.\n",

The playground is awesome,  with mommy and me swings, jungle gym and a really cool nature interactive board with a scope to spot animals. There is a huge field to play in in the middle which is great, keeps kids safe and away from traffic. Bathrooms are clean well lit and the handicapped bathroom is excellently designed! Showers are separate from bathrooms, Yea! There is a laundry with a sink. Several trails surround and spin off the campground. The lake is peaceful with a pier. Very laid back place,  great for couples or families with youngsters!",
   "We love Lums Pond! We stay here every winter. The park has been upgraded over the past couple of years so that all sites are full hookup. This year they have added a small laundry facility that is located right next to the large playground. We will be back!",
   "It\u2019s amazing that such a small state like Delaware has such great state parks. So jump on your gravel bikes and explore the trails of this park. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",
   "We came here to swing through the trees and we did just that. We were here a year or two ago and did the basic ropes course through the trees. Then we came again recently to visit this time we did the advanced course. It was totally worth it and a lot of fun."

   "I was told 4,000 snow geese flock there. I did not see any. In fact, I saw almost no birds. The area is too vast to explore by foot or car. Boat is probably the better option in warmer weather. Very peaceful though.",
   "I will return to hike the trails and to visit Fowler Beach. Mom and I visited the well equipped Ranger Station and got maps and info.\nThis NWR was unknown to me and obviously a well-kept secret gem! We spent a lot of time driving the winding roads and on Route 1 that is the only way to reach the winding beach access roads. Protecting the acres of protected bay dunes and marshlands is obviously an important priority. So expect to park and walk to area close to waterways! The dunes are unharmed and I saw a snowy egret and some turtles and visitors crabbing off a bridge over a stream.\nI watch, study and maybe photograph Nature and wildlife! Though, this refuge is a resource for permitted hunters of waterfowl in season. I saw info and tags near the eastern entrance. \nI also noticed a trail head for The National Trail System Florida to Canada. Pack lunch this refuge is purely natural. No pizza or fries!",
   "The visitor center was really nice and the man at the counter was amazingly kind and very knowledgeable. Can't wait to come back!!!",
   "great place for birds, bugs, and vistas. I loved learning about all the species of animals and plants by doing the junior refuge manager program. Similar to the junior ranger program with the national park service but different style badge.",
   "We walked the boardwalk path and the other lookout path (which is a little longer and joins with the boardwalk) with a toddler in an umbrella stroller. These paths were very well maintained, but it probably wouldn't be the best idea in muddy weather. The lady at the visitor center was extremely kind and pulled out all sorts of things for our little guy to look at. That said, even with the (very lovely) walks, we were only there a little more than an hour, and older kids would probably be bored, as they don't have very new or unusual displays. If you're looking for nature walks, it is a great choice though."

Used to always come here with my family as a child so I guess we're starting the tradition back up lol. $8 parking for out of state isn't bad. Boat rentals are fairly cheap compared to other state parks I've been to. Can't wait to stay at their camp site!",

Although some sections scared the POO OUT OF ME!!!!!!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I chose this for my 12 year old daughter's birthday present and I WAS THE ONE SCARED TO DEATH!!! My gf, my ex-wife, and my 2 daughters had more kahunas than I did!!!!!!! I finished the course though. You will definitely need upper body and core strength to complete the Tree Top Adventure. They also offer another one that's a little less harrowing. Great time had by all and an excellent choice for a fun outing!!!!! This place is inside of a state park. There are grills, picnic areas, and cabanas. The state park is huge, so if you get there early enough (the Tree Top Adventure takes 2-3 hours) there's plenty to do in the state park. Trust me, my pictures do not do this experience any justice!!!",
   "Must visit place for kids . Tree top is short duration but it's worth",
   "I loved the experience even though I had a very hard time going through the course. I must gain strength and lose weight if I ever think about doing this adventure again. Lol Thanks for the push staff.",
   "My husband and I bought five tickets a piece and decided to use it weekly to get ourselves doing some physical activity that wasn't too hard. So we bought the five tickets for the junior course! Today was our first day using it and we had a great time! We are looking forward to the next four weeks and the fun that we will have doing this junior course. We felt very safe. They are very safety conscious and check everything every day!"

   "Overall, great experience!  It's started out a little rough when the ferry left early; however, the staff handled the situation perfectly.  The ferry ride was great and definitely added to the experience.  On the island, we paid $5 extra per person for the inside tour, which lasted about 2 and 1/2 hours.  The guide was excellent and very knowledgeable.  Also, we got to see parts of the fort that aren't included in the regular admission.  One important thing to note is that this is a \"leave it as is\" site; therefore, any trash must taken with you when you leave the island and food and drink options on the island are very limited.\n\nHighly recommended!",
   "I went to the POW event weekend & they have a lot of civil war reenactors. One part of the fort is for only bat tours. The rest of the fort you can walk around & you can use the stairs to get on the top. You can see the bay from the top. The fort do have cannons. There is picnic tables but you will have to take the trash with you. We paid $24 for the ferry for 2 people to go to the island. The ferry ride is around 10min from & to the island.",
   "Great day out, and in beautiful weather.  We had a minor issue with the ferry breaking down, but the delay was minimal, and all staff were great.  The fort and surrounding park area was a beautiful and interesting place.",
   "We've lived here for 35 years.  This was our first trip to this park.  There are boats that take you to the prison.  You need to buy tickets.  There was a great ice cream place across the street.",
   "Great place to take the kids for a day! Had fun looking for ghost, like on Ghost Hunters. Hiked the nature trail biting flies,but a good walk! Kids learned a lot about the history! Been coming here since the1970's before they had electricity in a lot of the areas! Had several scouting events here, everyone seemed to have a good time! And more of the fort was opened to public than now, but still a very good place to come back to! Hard to believe that if you live in, Delaware mainly in New Castle region, and you have not been there to the island you really need to go! And not to forget the boat ride experience! Can't wait to get back there!"

However, more interestingly, it still retains remnants of an old pier that used to go into the water. This place still has it's lampposts standing. Walking around here makes for an eerie experience and you can totally take amazing post-apocalyptic photos! It's just a hop away from the nearby historic district. So make sure to go here while you're in New Castle to view some history. \n\nRecommended!",
   "It was very nice. Park itself was very clean with no trash lying around. However, few area's where there were mounds of geese droppings. So just pay attn where you walk, but all and all very nice!!",
   "Good place for an evening stroll in a culture rich part of Delaware. There are good photo spots and walking trails and even some sandy areas for a beach feel. Recommend this place for casual evening walks, small family picnics and so on.",
   "I grew up 40 years ago in this park. It has been  upgraded and discovered by thousands in part because of the pokemon go. Now during the summer hundreds enjoy the park every day. It has a waterfront walking path kids climbing entertainment area with slides. It has a dwarf, but you cannot fish. It has a sailing club. Great small town park.",

The woman there was very knowledgeable about the wines, and the wines were a fascinating old-fashioned exploration both of terrior and older, traditional Italian-style winemaking techniques. I was really facinated by the white wines that spent contact on the skins; loved both the Deleware and the Niagara.  My favorite of the reds was the Two Brothers Chambourcin and Cab blend. Recorded a podcast for my blog about the Delaware a few nights ago, actually, as that was the bottle that came back with me.",
   "We love to stop in here a couple of times a year to try out their new wines. With the Pizzadili's, wine-making is an art they brought with them from Italy. They love what they do, and they make some very good wines. They have a great little gift shop there as well, so if you know a wine lover, this is the place to buy them a birthday present. Do a tasting and they will be happy to tell you about each wine. I love it that they all are so down to earth and willing to share what they know about their craft.\n\nIgnore most of the negative reviews. Some of the neighbors are upset because Pizzadili was opposed to allowing a dirt track raceway to be built next to their business.",

Its a BEAUTIFUL place to visit.",
   "This place is an experience.  Full of rich history and breathtaking scenery.  The grounds are kept pristine and beautiful.  Do yourself a favor and give yourself at least two days here because there is that much to see.  I've been twice so far, once in the summer and once at Christmas time and both times were unique.  If you can, see the fountain shows and see the Christmas displays for sure.  You won't be disappointed.",
   "One of my favorite places to be. Always something new to see on each trip. Great to go to some of my favorite spots in the gardens & see how it looks different with each season.\n\nWonderful place to get away and just relax. Some days it\u2019s hiking in the meadow on the trails. Other days it might be sitting on a bench & watching the fountains or waterfalls.\n\nDefinitely worth a membership & the hour drive.",
   "Simply the best! Go at Christmas, it's a magical escape and it will put you into the holiday spirit. We went on a drizzly night with lots of mist in the air which created an ethereal setting, the outdoor lights diffused and eerie. Loved it! The gigantic greenhouse goes on and on and on; there was a huge pipe organ and an organist and at least 75 people participating in A Christmas carol sing along which was delightful. Everybody was singing! It was really nice that all those strangers were coming together in that moment. Make sure you look for the unique and somewhat odd bathroom area with little pods that run along a curved hallway. The hall walls have plants growing up them. Our friends showed us this and it was a lot of fun to visit the round restrooms! Hit up the on-sight restaurant; one of the best meals we've had this past year. Just outside the restaurant there was a bar area with good micro brews. Lots of fun on a Friday evening with minimal crowds. I think the rain helped us out.",
   "We went here during the orchid extravaganza in March. Had a wonderful time. The diversity of scenery (even in the winter months) is extraordinary. Meadows, forests, topiary, fountains, treehouses and greenhouses that are filled to capacity with flowers. Beautiful places to walk. Some areas paved, others are not. Definitely bring good walking shoes.\n\nTheir main exhibit at the time were the orchids in the conservatory. Beautiful arrangements of orchids on walls and hanging baskets, along with bonsai trees, succulents, and hybrid orchid varieties. They definitely put a lot of care into their exhibit to make sure it is well maintained.\n\nPrice-wise, the entrance tickets are a little expensive at $25 dollars a person. The prices at the cafe inside are also steep. Because of this though, the gardens, buildings, and fountains are very well maintained. And the food is decent quality. They definitely put the money to good use creating and maintaining the beautiful landscape.\n\nIf your in the Philadelphia area and looking for a fun day trip, definitely check out Longwood Gardens."

   "A pretty good water park near the beach. Wasn't too crowded but it was Thursday. Had 2 fun slides. 4 slower quick slides. But no lines. Lazy river was fun to just chill. No alcohol. Food at cafe wasn't too bad as far as price. Flavor wasn't bad either. Price overall was a bit high but to be expected.",
   "Great place for the family. Very clean as well",
   "Nice place to come and relax, slides are an extra fun for adult and kids. Plenty to do for toddler's as well.  The anaconda slide is especially fun due to the slide resembling that of a snake.  Food here is at a pretty reasonable price. Plenty of life guards changing up almost ever 30 mins to an hour.",
   "at first you kind of taken back by the price +$100 for a family of 3. Parking is free, and once inside your greeted with a clean crowd free activity environment.\n\nThere are water attractions for all ages and interest.\n\nThis is definitely a place we will visit again.",
   "I had a blast here, and so did the kids. Perfect size for a water park. Not too crowded,  easy to get around, areas for young kids to play (splash pads).\n\nThe food area was good as well, your typical staples, pizza, chicken tenders, fries, hot dogs. \n\nThe bumper boats were a blast. You get to pilot a small boat, and as the name would suggest bump into other floating contraptions with sentient beings inside (read: boats with people).\n\nThe lazy river was awesome. We probably went around 10 times by the end. \n\nHighly recommend a trip here. Much more fun than sesame place in all honesty."

I had 3 maps and honestly none were correct.... the DE access lots are only  free  from December 1st  to March 1st.. there is very little here worth an $8 per vehicle out of state parking charge so be warned..  use the adjunct Pa lots to avoid these ridiculously high user fees.. no state park w/o lifeguarded swimming available should be more than $3 for anyone to day use ..",

The stall and Volunteers were very friendly and very informed about the area and its history. They relayed their love for the area and their bountiful knowledge to us in a easy and fun way.",
   "This place is neat. First,  it's easy to find and Lewes is a pretty town.  The museum is free and contains items from a shipwreck along with interesting information. There is an art display upstairs. If you have any Dutch heritage this would be good to visit. Nice restaurants within walking distance.",
   "We visited to see the merman. The museum itself is lovely as well as the outside grounds. Staff were curious and knowledgeable.",
   "Interesting museum. It's tiny, two floors, so you won't be there all day. Info video on the main level is worth watching since it tells you all the stuff you should know about Lewes. Some nice art work. Staff there is are very friendly and informative. It's free.",
   "This museum/park is truly unique. I didn't go in the museum because I have my 2 little dogs with me. I learned a lot from the signs outside. The park is small and clean, and well equipped with a fully functional restroom, trash cans, doggy poop stations."

   "We had a 2nd birthday there. It was AMAZING. Olivia, our party leader was wonderful with the kids and with helping me get everything ready. All the guests had a blast and we even got vouchers for the kids we paid for that couldn't make it. \n\nThe museum itself was great. Really clean. And the exhibits had something for all kids ages. Even the parents had fun playing. I seriously can't recommend this place enough.",
   "Cannot say enough about how wonderful this place is!! We are members and visit often and our three year old never runs out of things to try! Programs and art activities are well run and simple enough to do even during a quick visit. Staff are super friendly and even when it is crowded they do a fantastic job keeping the place tidy and organized.",
   "Many different rooms, each with it's own theme. Perfect for 4 year olds, with some areas or activities less accessible to younger kids. They have a large water table that my two year old could interact with, although taller, stronger, and older in general makes it a lot more fun. Other kids helped her so it actually worked out beautifully. There are areas meant for younger kids so it depends on what interests your child has and we mainly noticed because we were there with a 3 year old so the accessibility  and interest by age was apparent. My husband and I also enjoyed it since it is set up for learning.",
   "The Delaware Children's Museum was simply delightful! I was worried about what an almost walking 13 month old would be able to do, and the answer is: a lot!\n\nWe loved the little kids'area with the trains and the magnetic gears. The mock farmers market was also great, though certainly meant for slightly older toddlers. We didn't venture into any of the areas where the bigger kids were playing.\n\nThey have very large family restrooms, for which we were extremely grateful. Diaper changes for a worked up toddler can be a two adult job! \n\nWe were very pleased to see that we could host a birthday party there, and for a very reasonable price. There are a variety of themes designed specifically with the interested and abilities of certain age groups in mind.",
   "Wonderful! My two and a half grandson had a blast. Didn't know where and what to do first. The different areas had appropriate age levels listed and appropriate items for those age groups. It was fun. We'll be back !"

In the summer we frequent their farmers market where they invite local farmers to bring their vegetables, meats, dairy products, and plants.",

I enjoy photography the bridge from the dock as well as sitting on a bench at the pier and simply enjoy the view of the Potomac. The sunsets are some of the best I\u2019ve experienced in my lifetime. A stop at the welcoming center will give you all the information and history you need to know. Ask about future events. There is always something exciting and fun happening.",

Excellent coffee shop, plenty of good quality restaurants, quite a few genuine antique shops and a really great memorabilia and film/music/bookstore that also carries some 1st and 2nd edition  rare and classic books (sometimes also signed by the author).\nReally relaxed ambiance and an amazing fourth of July fireworks show every year. Right by the water so a truly great stop anytime of year.",

   "Great Little lighthouse and bay that I've been visiting all of my life. I grew up about 40 minutes away and my dad and I would take evening trips to visit the lighthouse and go to the diner nearby for a slice of pie. This lighthouse will always hold a special place in my heart and I always tell people visiting the area to take the drive and check it out. The Horseshoe crabs that frequent the shore are awesome too!",
   "Despite being off the beaten path, the East Point Lighthouse is well worth the trip! Very picturesque, there were people taking photos for their Christmas card when we were there. It's not very tall so if you're afraid of heights it's not a problem, but it's tall enough to get a great view of the Delaware Bay and Maurice River. The staff is so friendly and informative. There are many items displayed that are from the early to mid 1900s. But the coolest feature is you can actually turn on the light yourself! Ask them how, they'll be happy to tell you. This may/is the only lighthouse you can do this!",
   "Place is scenic, good for stargazing or photography. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the history of the site. Place needs help with more donations so be sure to contribute if you can. Fair warning, it's infested with biting flies during certain warm months of the year and they DO NOT give an F about bug spray. Wearing long sleeve and pants and long socks can go a long way to protecting yourself ( cover that neck too). Scarves could be used to cover face as well if they are particularly aggressive. If you are doing photography here this is a must. Heed this warning.",
   "The lighthouse wasn't open when we went but still so much to enjoy. We were able to walk along the water, find shells and rocks. Just had a beautiful day. It wasn't crowded, cars came and left fast. It's just a great place to enjoy nature not so much lay out or swim like on a beach. We just wanted to relax and enjoy the sounds of the water so it was perfect for us. We got to see around the lighthouse just not inside it. We'll go another time to do a lighthouse tour though. We will come back that's for sure.",

Fred\u2019s thoughtful instruction in technique, and historical information about the origins of the \u201cProvincetown Print\u201d, allow students to immediately immerse themselves in this art form.\n\nFred makes this course easily accessible to artists and non artists alike, with many hands on demonstrations and one on one instruction.  He also has the unique ability to bring a diverse group of strangers together and build them into a supportive group of friends, with activities that enable everyone to get to know their classmates.  Fred proved to the non illustrators in the group that you don\u2019t need special art skills to be able to make lovely prints.  Anyone can learn this!\n\nFred\u2019s enthusiasm for the subject is so contagious that six months after taking his first workshop, our original group is still meeting weekly to make prints!  Join this workshop the next time around, you will love it.",

The depiction of animals throughout the museum are cold and not engaging for children and adults alike. I know this isn\u2019t the Smithsonian but it could be so much more, especially considering the beauty and location of this building.",
   "So much to see and do.\nMy grand daughter wants to go every other week.  Very kid friendly and a great staff.",
   "It's small and simple. It's self guided so you can go at your own pace. Lots of things to touch for the kids. Inside and a few things outside. Seems geared towards kids and field trips.",
   "Awesome place! Great for field trips, great for kids and adults both!! Unique exhibits and cool artifact stuff."

   "It's still well kept park. Cabins and lean-too are in excellent shape. As a child my parents and grandparents would rent a cabin at Thanksgiving. We took our dogs AND cats with us to enjoy it. I'll post a Pic after I find my photo album of the bunks. Our cats and dogs are in that Pic. I have fond memories of there. I still rent a cabin now n then. Need to take my daughter to show her and take a nice hike. The trails are phenomenal as, well. I highly recommend this place \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e",

   "Great trails, fairly easy to walk round. Free parking.  Some great lake views and very clean.",
   "Parvin State Park has been a wonderful place for me for the past 25 years. Fishing, canoeing, swimming. It's kinda dated, but as you can see it's absolutely gorgeous. Check out Ant's kayaks and canoes for rentals; prices were a bit steep but the service was good, and the lake was crystal clear. They had a little a refreshment shack there that covered the basics. Overall, a great family day. Have not done any camping there since it's only 30 minutes from where I grew up.",
   "Went camping here with family in mid-September, and it was a great time to go. Took canoes and paddle boats on the water and there was a lot to explore, tons of wildlife to see and everyone on the water was very nice. There was someone employed by Jersey parks who held a micro-invertabrae exploration session that was very cool for all ages. (Most of) The campsites are large and well spaced out, some lead directly to the boating areas, others lead to picnic areas. IDEAL time, will definitely return. Be on the lookout for the state police, as he verified our non-alcoholic beer bottles one morning."

Lunch was delicious,the waitress was excellent.\nWe can\u2019t wait to come back n try the dinner menu.",

   "Pizza was pretty good and only slightly pricey. I was disappointed that when we picked up 4 large pizzas they didn't offer any free soda or even plates and napkins for our takeout order. And while it tasted good, it was weird to have a margarita pizza with arugula and stead of basil. The pizzas also could have had slightly more sauce. I didn't want to ask for extra sauce not knowing initially how much sauce normally comes on it. We will try out other pizza places in Dover, but are likely to come back to this one again.",
   "Recommend to everyone. Food was great. \n\nI have been there a few times and each time it is really good.  The place is very clean and has a comfy seats. The place has a nice are inside and out with nice pictures tables and looks. Then once I got inside it became better. The staff was friendly and helped us to a table then took the order very fast which was nice. The pizza was the best it was the perfect slice and was cheap for what you get. Would recommend to anyone.  The place is very different from before. But I can\u2019t wait to come back many more times.",

   "We were down in Dover to take my mother in law out to dinner for her birthday. My niece, who is local recommended 33 West for something different to try. It doesn't look like much when you first walk in. Very simple. But not in a bad way. They have a good beer menu and the blood orange martini was on point. They have different and interesting menu items. The brussel sprout appetizer is a must! Delicious! Our table had a variety of items from burgers and tacos to my pork belly and fried green tomatoes. Fabulous! If I had a negative it would be slow service. Very friendly though.",
   "Phenomenal time at 33 West. If you're a fan of Dive bars/restaurants and enjoy a great selection of food or beer? This is your place. Not to mention the service is fantastic.",
   "Awesome food! We went last week to Taco Tuesday and the taco's were soooooo good.  Every Tuesday they have a different two taco's. Look forward to seeing what next week has to offer :)",
   "Hit The Mark! Stumbled upon 33 while in Dover overnight on business. Service, atmosphere, quality, & flavor were all just right. Eclectic vibe and diverse crowd on a Tuesday night gave all the right cues we had chosen well. 2 things that drive up the review: 1-With the somewhat open kitchen I noticed the cook changing gloves often, thanks for that. 2-One of the cooks came out to work with another guest on her special order. The Eggplant Stack was full of flavor and cooked just right. Buffalo wings brought just the right heat and a touch of sweet. Other options caught my eye, so I'll have to get back:)",
   "The entrance is uninviting but once your round the corner to the bar area it is a cozy dinner spot. The Shrimp & Spinach was great with the miso ginger dressing. The Pan Seared Tuna Steak was cooked nicely but could have used some seasoning. Overall a good experience."

Fish cakes used to come with certain meals but now we must always pay for them. Everything is still the same price (or higher) but you are now getting less. The staff is also noticeably less friendly and welcoming. It\u2019s starting to seem more and more like it\u2019s all about the bottom line and less about customer satisfaction.",

We had a large party and the service was impeccable, we never had to wait and the orders came out perfectly.

Decided to make the best of it and went out to what was described as good and somewhat romantic spot.  \nMade a reservation for early evening.  We arrived and our table was waiting.   Table wobbled.   First problem.  Second problem was the interior was ice cold.  My wife had to wear her coat to be warm and comfortable. Third problem was our salmon was served with a mixed vegetable that did not go well with the fish.  My wife requested angle hair pasta in place of mashed potatoes.  When the pasta was served it clearly was not angle hair.\nThen we were told that angle hair was not on the menu and that what was taking so long to serve it.  The night was not good and we eventually went somewhere else to eat.\nStaff was good, polite and professional.",

   "Lunch prices are fair but hubby's meatball hoagie was a tad spare. \nI got the Turkey Reuben and it was made perfectly, but again,  a little spare. \n\nBoth tasted good but disappeared too quickly. \n\nI got the tots and I thought it was something homemade. Seemed like something out of a freezer bag, and came out lukewarm. I mentioned this and was able to get new HOT fries.\n\nThe fries are almost too little for finger food and since they come in a stack they present as such.  Dumping them on the plate showed how teeny they were.  I think to be served in a stack or even eaten with a fork, they need more size. Also for more \"tooth\" satisfaction. \n\nI am a potato person so the perfect potato side could have made this a 5 star meal, even with the moderate portions. Maybe next time and I believe there will be a next time.",
   "A spectacular spot in downtown Dover for dinner and/or drinks. The only, and I Emphasize only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it closes too early! It would be a great place to hang out until midnight or later. The food is great the selection at the bar is great, but it closes too early.",

   "This place has a good atmosphere and quite good Mexican style cuisine. The burritos are my favorite, especially with beans and a side of their amazing corn cake. The dessert selection is great too with my favorite being the flash fried cheese cake. The only thing I'd say is not astounding compared to other Mexican restaurants would be their salsas as they just don't quite do it for me as they seem kinda bland compared to other places. But Overall this is a great place to go if you are in the mood for Mexican food.",
   "Waitress was very nice but service was very slow.  Waited over 40 min to get our entrees... place was not busy at all. Good overall was good.",
   "It\u2019s a tough rating for me.  I went 4 stars but was leaning 3.  Pros:   The place was PACKED.  We almost didn\u2019t go in figuring it would be forever.  Not the case.  Quickly seated.  Quick service.  Food came quick.  Servers were attentive and active.  So why leaning 3?   The food.  It was mediocre.  Our group all ordered fajitas.  I mean were they bad?  No.  Were they really good?  No too.  In the end the service bumped it up for me but it\u2019s not a place I would go out of my way to come eat at even with the service.",
   "I'm still surprised by how much the quality of the food and the service fluctuates. I've been here a good number of times and I've had a great experience. But also about half of those visits have been just terrible experiences. If you stick with non-traditional Mexican food, you'll be pretty safe on getting good food. But others are a hit or miss. Like fajitas with nothing but onions as the veggies. Overall this isn't a bad place to visit, but when they charge you 2 dollars extra for hot salsa and don't tell you, it throws you off. It's not the best for the price.",
   "They have parking all around the building. They were busy when I came in, but I still found a spot.\nThis is a stand alone restaurant that looks like it could've been a fast food joint at one point. The place had quite a few tables and a large bar area. They had a slight wait for tables, but I chose to sit at the bar. The bar had a solid tequila selection of around 50 or so with a good top shelf. The service was top notch, everything I needed I got quickly. The decor was aesthetically pleasing. My only issue was that the floor was a little slippery in my sneakers.\n\nI ordered a Modelo bottle. It was cold and delicious. I also did a couple shots of 1800 which was about $9 a pop. Not terrible, not great.\n\nChips & Salsa!!!\nChips...solid chip, tasted like it should, and could hold a topping well.\nSalsa...the red was chunky and more of a pico, but a bit mushy. The green was a solid tomatillo based salsa, just a little on the tangy side for me.\n\nI ordered Stuffed Jalapenos:Four large jalapeno peppers, hollowed out and filled with our cream cheese mixture, then wrapped in back and broiled. Spicy, creamy, and savory in every bite! $8.99\nThey weren't wrong in their description. These were delicious, fresh jalapenos, wrapped in bacon. They misspelled bacon on the online menu lol. I was like what is back exactly? They also had a bit of showtime in there, coming out on a sizzling plate. Exciting!!!\n\nI ordered Street Corn: Steamed and grilled corn with mayo, cotija mexican cheese, and chile powder (optional) $3.\nThe corn was solid, I like it a bit sloppier, but this fulfilled my craving. I go nuts every time I see some sort of elote. I gotta have it!!!\n\nI ordered a tamale, although I don't see it on the online menu. It was chicken with verde sauce and cheese that melted on top. The masa was tasty, almost dry, but not. The chicken inside was good and flavorful. I should've used more sauce on this. I feel like the pork might be an even better choice.\n\nI ordered Tacos Al Pastor: Three tacos filled with our original al pastor seasoned pork, served Mexican taco -stand style. $11.99.\nI didn't see an option to get tacos like I normally do, so I went with the Pastor trio.\nThe pork was seasoned well and delicious. The flour tortilla tried to dry it out, so I used more of the green salsa to combat it. I wasn't asked my preference, I thought \"taco stand style\" would be corn tortillas. Nopeski! With that being said, they were good on the flavor meter, and loaded with meat.\nBeans...chunky texture, nothing special, serviceable.\nRice...soft, fluffy, a little crisp, nothing special to me."

I saw some pizzas people ordered that looked delicious! Great service! Generous portions! I ordered linguine in oil and garlic with shrimp, wow I couldn't believe how many shrimp was in this dish. Big portion. Definitely a go to place for Italian food. Hardest working, attentive manager, Marco, I've ever seen. It was busy, he jumped right in, took orders, served. Owners did an excellent job choosing him. We go to Dover every year and last trip found this little gem. I will def stop for dinner again, probably more than once. We LOVED THIS PLACE!!!",

   "Such a great recommendation from my brother!\n\nThis is some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The service was prompt and so incredibly respectful and friendly. The food came out promptly and servings were enough to make two meals out of a single order.\n\nI'm a fan of spicy food and the spice here is hot but not in a way that overwhelms the underlying flavors. The sushi was also excellent and tasted fresh and you can even watch the chefs make it in the dining room.\n\nWill definitely return to continue eating my way through the menu.",
   "The owners were very smart for being open on Christmas.  They were the only sit down place open.  The place was packed and I know why..... Food and service were great!!! \nDining area was cramped, the tables too close so getting in and out of seats were interesting.  Overall very good food, lots of veggies, everyone was happy and not too expensive at all.",
   "Always very fresh and delicious! Their spicy tiger roll and hot lover roll are 2 of our favorites!!",
   "The best sushi I have ever had. My favorite sushi place. Cannot complain about anything. Great food and great service too!!",
   "Rice food was delicious! Presentation was amazing. I didn't think to take other picture but the sushi was amazing."

   "This was a little place we happened upon on our way home from the beach. We stopped for breakfast and it was absolutely delicious. Our waitress was outstanding. She was so friendly and attentive. Always right there to fill the coffee and that place was hopping. My only complaint was the bathroom situation. For a busy place, they only have 1 single bathroom for men and 1 for women, so there was a line. Must be a local favorite since it is a little out of the way, but so busy. I would definitely go back again.",
   "This place was not good. The only good thing about it was the size of the portions but the flavor was off. The problem with the eggs is that they were overcooked and under seasoned. The potatoes had no seasoning. One of our family members got a chip beef waffle and it literally came with 2 tablespoons of chipped beef. There were so many flies in the dining area that I felt like I kept swatting at them. The inside was very dated and dirty. I don't understand why people are giving this place such good reviews. One thing that was nice is outside there is a little overlooked that allows you to feed the fish below. That was fun. But I review based on food and restaurant and this place has a lot of opportunities for growth.",
   "Service was exceptionally good and the liver and onions are to die for! The red snapper was perfect. The crab cakes have a little too much filler for me, but I usually make my own and dont use any filler. I'd go back again.",
   "Please do not eat anything other than breakfast here! The seafood is frozen and was served semi-raw. The scallops were chewy with NO flavor. The crab cake and stuffed shrimp were also completely filled with bread. Both the manager and server were not very apologetic about our experience and was told \u201cdont worry about it\u201d, when requesting a partial refund.",
   "If you are in Dover, this is the place to start your mornings, take a break for lunch, or settle back and enjoy a peaceful evening dinner. On our five day trip to visit family, we enjoyed two meals here. Breakfast and lunch helped to make our trip to Dover a most memorable trip. The breakfast for me consisted of scrambled eggs, french toast, and bacon. Simple items but they were darn near perfect! Both visits we were blessed to have excellent service! This place is not to be missed if you are in Dover! Enjoy the wildlife on the mini deck overlooking Silver Lake too! The kids will love it..."

   "Great flavors, great menu, great selections and GREAT customer service! The Slow cooked Beef Brisket is to die for, it melts in your mouth. The sweet potatoes, mac n cheese and Sweet Tea set it off \ud83d\ude0b",
   "This location catered food at my place of employment the end of last year and it tasted amazing. I went on 2/15/20 and had the pulled pork, pulled chicken, Cole slaw and green beans and was totally disappointed. I'm about to toss the rest of the food because I'm not going to eat it. So disappointed. I guess it depends on the person. My friend had the ribs and he thoroughly enjoyed them. Try it for yourself. Great cause so I'll continue to support them occasionally.",
   "OMG!! What is not good about this place?! I don't know! Everything was delicious, the ribs were just like they are supposed to, falling off the bone. The brisk was tender and delicious. The sausage was good... The mac and cheese \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f!!! The string beans were really good also. The Turkey sandwich delish, even thought it looked dry, but it wasn't! The corn cake was one of the best! The pull pork was so flavorful. Also, I loved almost all of the BBQ sauces they had. I cannot forget about the staff!!! The best customer service I have had in such a long time. They were all so wonderful. I somehow wished I lived here to have it again. Love this place.",
   "Excellent all around!  The Cashier was friendly and helpful, the prep guy was great and they brought out desserts for us since it was our first time there.  Great food, great service, will absolutely come back.",
   "I\u2019d give it 100 stars! Perfectly cooked and prepared. Minimal wait after order at register. Seating in clean rustic canteen style with ample seasonings and paper towels at each table. Much genuine military and responders memorabilia displayed throughout."

   "Would definitely come back here. Food was very good and our waitress was friendly and attentive. The hostess, not so much, but that was a one minute contact until we got seated. Nice view onto lake. \nStuffed meatballs and roasted corn appetizer. Jambalaya and Kitchen Sink burger for entr\u00e9es. All were very good. Restrooms clean and attended. When we went the bar area was \"buzzing\" so it might be a little difficult for anyone with hearing sensitivities. Many menu options including entr\u00e9es, burgers, sandwiches, and salads.",
   "We love McGlynn's! Great food and specials. Attentive staff. You will enjoy the view.",
   "Food is great, Service is even better, location is amazing during the day and if you can see Silver Lake, decor and atmosphere are amazing.  My only gripe...As someone of Irish blood, is one would think that a place that has an Irish name, Irish decor and themes; that they would serve more typical Irish food. Guinness Lamb stew, corned beef,  Shepard's pot pie, potato and leek soup.  But no, I see nachos, fish tacos, burgers, and bourbon on the salmon. Don't get me wrong, what they make is really good, and worth going back for more. It just doesnt fit. I think a menu revamp would serve this place well.",
   "The Kitchen Sink burger is big and very tasty with lots of toppings. The colossal crab sandwich was good but I wouldn't call it colossal. Could have definitely eaten another one to be satisfied. Good selection of drinks and free popcorn. Great location right on the water!",
   "Had the kitchen sink burger, some Yuengling and plenty of local entertainment in the form of fights and singing. DJ was pretty good too. We got in late and needed some food, everyone's was pretty decent and didn't take very long considering it was a Friday night and the bar was packed. There was however a nice fight that broke out, barf in the bathroom, and some pretty rowdy patrons but hey, it's a bar. We had fun. Food was good. Would go back"

People drive by because of the location on main road but definitely worth the stop. Food leaves your stomach warm and full. Completely listen to the server's suggestions on what to order. Quickly became a favorite place for my husband and I to have a lovely quiet meal. What I would call a diamond in the rough.",

   "I really loved this place. The food was great and the staff friendly. I'll be going back soon!",
   "Really good food!  I always get the chicken kabob wraps or ginger chicken w/ rice.  The chutney sauce sets it OFF.  The prices are very affordable, if you dine in, service can be slow but take out is prompt.",
   "This last experience was disappointing. The Chicken Tikka Kabab were NOT fresh. It was little cold in the middle and had no taste and flavor. The worst thing, it was cold from center and was definitely made from frozen premade. \nI'll be honest and upfront. I visited this place almost 3 yrs ago and it was not like this. The kebabs I ordered were freshly made and had very good flavor. \nThey are adding an Indian grocery store to this restaurant.\nI hope they will improve on their food preparation and maintain a better quality fresh product."

   "Wow!  The Mama Grotto Pizza is so good.  I never knew there was such a pizza.  It's just delicious.  Thank you for fast, efficient, and friendly service.  The store was very clean and Tonya was quite helpful giving me plenty of napkins, plates, and packets of parmesan cheese.  The restroom was spotless.  Thank you Grottos for my beach experience in March.",
   "I just had to laugh at our experience. Stopped in on the way to the beach as it was late evening and we wanted our favorite pizza. 4 tables total occupied in restaurant, we were seated, 2 employees passed by us probably 20 times neither one saying a word or looking at us. Waited 20 minutes for a girl to say she would be right with us (same one that kept waiting table right behind us). She knew we were ready to walk out. Big mistake coming here, pizza was delicious so that's why I gave it a star but wish I could give negatives. What we hoped to be a semi short stop, ended up an hour. No sense in complaining to staff because they all stood around on phones or talking, obviously didn't care to check on us. I have NEVER  seen a popcorn machine this dirty, looks like it caught fire..nope..girl closed up machine for the night and left it as is. Never EVER will go back to this one, this location gives Grotto's a bad look!! Visited 7/17/19. 8pm",
   "While on our way to a wedding in DE, we decided, on a whim, to give Grotto Pizza a try for lunch. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very family friendly! An open, spacious dining room, arcade/game room for kids, and a bar for the adults. \nPizza was the obvious choice for lunch, as I was anxious to give it a try for the first time. Unfortunately, it didn't pass the test for a decent pizza pie. The crust was too soft and undercooked. A bit more crispy would have been ideal. The sauce wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't anything that stood out. The biggest \"killer\" for me was the over abundance of cheese. Way too much, to where the pizza was loaded with grease, and it almost made it difficult to swallow without the cheese getting stuck in my throat. \nI'm sure it's a great pizza for the locals and that is absolutely fine. But I've had excellent pizza in my travels, and unfortunately  Grotto Pizza is not one of them."

The salads were fantastic, but the sodas were just seltzer water, without syrup.the waitress was friendly and understanding, and brought out fresh drinks. I ordered the crunchy spicy California roll which was delicious. The Hibachi chef was friendly, and good at what he does. The chicken and shrimp combo was delicious. I am only giving 4 stars because I (and it seemed like other patrons) was uncomfortably hot. Hibachi places tend to be warmer, but this place more so. I also give 4/5 as the price tag was a bit higher than what I have seen at other hibachi places for a nearly identical meal.",

I don't know, I do know, I'm nitpicking but I would rather a full 14 in than an emtpy\u2019ish 16 inch roll.  The pizzas look really good.  Good overall experience.",
   "The jumbo shrimp is only the size of a quarter, and was overcooked. The chicken fingers were overcooked. The containers were caved in because they were cheap aluminum. The calzone was put on a thin paper plate and shoved in the bag with the sauce. Tasted okay. The pizza was just okay, not great. I don't know why anyone would want to wait so long for this. Pretty pricey for the quality.",
   "Food, Service,and prices are excellent. The owner still visits each table to chat and make sure everything is good.",
   "This place has a nice variety of comfort foods on the menu.  I had a fried shrimp basket and was delighted to see that I could get onion rings instead of fries at no additional charge......... under $10. My companion had a chicken fingers basket and that chicken had big fingers... More like large chicken tenders. He said the fries were delicious. Our friend had pasta and cheese baked dish... I think it was stuffed shells. It was quite a nice serving and cake with salad and bread. She took half of it pasta home because it was just too much. I believe her dish was about $13. As we we're leaving we saw people eating pizza. Boy, that looks delicious too. And since we used to eat at their other location which is now closed, we know how good it is. We'll be back.",
   "This has got to be the best pizza place in Dover! We are a family from Connecticut and New York so we know our pizza and this was spot on!!  I don't know what one reviewer was talking about with her racist comments because when we went there the place was packed for dining and the take out line was out the door; all walks of life were in there AND NOBODY WAS TREATED DIFFERENTLY.  The staff was extremely busy yet friendly and the kitchen was clean.  This is now our go to pizza place!!!"

   "My wife and I walked in a half an hour before their buffet ended. When we told the man at the reception what we wanted he gave us a quizzical look and said he would have to talk to the manager. \n Mind you there are less than 10 other customers in the restaurant at this time. We waited 5 minutes for her to come out and say she didn't want to make any more buffet food so they wouldn't give it to us. \n So then we tell them we want to do normal dine in. They say ok and then we wait a few more minutes as they show each other some stuff on their phones before the man sighs, grabs 2 menus, walks us over to a booth in the corner and quickly drops the menus on the end of the table, spins on his heel and walks away without a word. We waited close to 10 minutes at the booth without anyone bringing us water or asking for our order before we got up and walked out.",
   "Wow, delicious food!  And large portions.  Stopped for Iunch while Christmas shopping and had a great meal.  The atmosphere is really unique, inside and out.  The waiter was very attentive, and the food was served fast.  Everything was warm and fresh, and of course warm tortilla chips & salsa.  We will definitely be back.",

I went inside the restaurant and told the guy I would like to try the tacos also I never had a taco! Hoping that they will make a good first impression however I was seated then got a bowl of chips and sauce which was lovely. My tacos came out and I was like what?? I could have done this myself it was horrible! Not what I expected.",

Overall the taste was decent whole time but the prices are a bit steep. Be safe when going, a bit sketchy but good food."

The appetizer was good as well.\n\nThe bad- we waited a long time for our dinners to come out. I ordered chicken with asparagus and tomato, and literally had two tomatoes and two pieces of asparagus on top my chicken. It came out cold. Additionally,  my broccoli was raw......\nMy husband ordered a steak and fries, and salad. The salad was good. The steak and fries were barely warm. The steak was thin, about half as thick as one from the texas roadhouse, and then once home he has had bad heartburn tonight.\n\nAll in all, do not recommend,  and we won't be back. Two stars ONLY because our waitress tried! Even she felt bad when she saw we barely touched our food.....and are out $68........",

The atmosphere is so great I've been going there for two years now. It's a wonderful place where everybody knows everybody,  it's like the TV show Cheers.",
   "Solid bar if you're out of town on a football Sunday and need somewhere to watch the game. There is a decent contingent of Buffalo Bills supporters as it's the local Bills backer bar. There are also a lot of Ravens, Eagles, and Washington fans, which makes sense considering the proximity. \n\nFood was pretty standard fare for a bar that knows what it is. Above average wings, respectable appetizer selection that comes across as competent. \n\nThey have the room to accommodate the crowd on a Sunday afternoon. Which means it comes off as roomy and comfortable on days when they aren't as busy."

   "This is a nice quaint Vietnamese restaurant located on Dupont hwy in Dover, DE. As a newbie to Vietnamese cuisine, I truly did enjoy my meal. First dish out was my appetizer, a nice fresh Shrimp Spring roll that was partnered with a delicious peanut sauce. I choose to order Pho combo # 2. This was a full bowl of rice noodles, mildly flavored Vietnamese beef broth that was boasting with tenderloin steak, brisket, tendon and meatball. My taste buds have now been officially elevated and I certainly will return!",
   "Visited here last week and the Pho is delicious! The broth has good flavor and there are sauces available if you want to spice it up. They bring out a plate of bean sprouts and basil to add as well. This bowl is a medium on their menu. The portions are very generous. Staff are friendly.",
   "The portions are really large, even medium sizes. I ordered a Beef broth soup. I started eating at 11:50am. It\u2019s 12:22pm now and the bowl is practically full.\n\nThe spring rolls are awesome too. I wish the music was more traditional Vietnamese.\n\nI\u2019d come again.",
   "Now this is a noodle place but that's not what I had. Pineapple fried rice w/ chicken caught my eye and I had to try it and egg roles. Loved it! The restaurant was very clean, service was busy but on top of things. Everything came out on time and very well presented. Servings are very large I'm looking forward to my left over. My wife did have the noodle bowl and loved it to. Definitely recommend giving this place a try. Cheers! \ud83c\udf7b",
   "We recently stopped in at Pho Viet on our way home from visiting Wilmington, Delaware. It's conveniently located just a few minutes off the highway and there's plenty of parking in the back. We grabbed a seat inside, ordered the vegetarian (tofu) spring roll as an appetizer and then got two entrees. Caroline got lemongrass chicken and I got chicken pho. Both were delicious. The pho broth was perfectly seasoned and salty and the portion of noodles and chicken was generous. It was also piping hot and came with fresh basil and sprouts. The lemongrass chicken was a high quality cut of chicken and also super flavorful. The staff is super friendly and eager to help. We'd definitely make a return visit. It was awesome. Next time we go I think we'd try one of the Louisiana/New Orleans specialty items on the menu."

The food was very good as it looks in the pictures, lots of flavors and spicy if you wanted it spicy. Since we went late at night there was almost no wait time. The tables are lovely decorated with beautiful carvings resembling typical scenarios of latin culture and don Freddy is wonderful host (as long as he is not busy :) but he'll always try to please you)",

   "Very good right from the door. I don't think I've ever ordered food served looking exactly like the photo on the menu until now. Delicious and served fast... Loved the atmosphere and the wait staff was very friendly...",
   "Food was great. Service was excellent even though they were busy. They gave us enough time to eat our salads before bringing out the main course, which is a very underrated skill. Thanks",
   "Great bar staff food was tasty and came out quickly! Complementary desert for my birthday",
   "Outback is a great chain restaurant. One thing I can say from a couple experiences at this location. If you have an issue with your food manager will come to your table. They will work until it's to your satisfaction and take care of you. Very courteous and professional.  Not something that is practiced well today. Thanks Outback and your wonderful staff!",
   "I went for my 42 birthday. Waited 2 1/2 hours to be sat. What does call ahead seating do for for parties of 8 or more if they aren't gonna have a table prepared for that many people you call for? Seriously!!!!!"

   "I normally like places that aren't chains when it comes to pizza, but this place is pretty good. I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. It's all good. I really like their appetizer egg roll cheesesteak! The pizza is good too.",
   "okay so I've been here two times. I can't even begin to express how much I love this place. The food is so good. It's always fresh. The salads are phenomenal. There are plenty of salads to choose from and I'm not talking about your average garden salad. Pretty much something. The dressings match the sounds perfectly. When you get the food it actually looks like the pics from the menu. The establishment is always clean the staff are always very friendly and they never botch my order regardless if I'm ordering for 2 or 6. It's fairly new so it's common for new restaurants to provide outstanding service. let's just hope in time that everything remains the same and I will remain a customer because I recommend this place to lot of friends I've even been here with my family two out of the three times and they love it and the elderly people in my family are really picky so gold \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\ude09 KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! PS-the prices are slightly higher than the average pizza place but this isn't your average Pizza joint so I think its right on the money!",

Our server was Kristen. She was personable and attentive and did a great job.  The food was very good. I will definitely go back.  I reserve 5 stars for high end dining experiences so a 4 star rating is a top rating for Pat's from me.",

   "They cook and serve free Thanksgiving dinners.  They also make a very good cheesesteak.  Pretty cool grandmother eclectic mix of stuff hanging on the walls.  The three people behind the counter seemed to be getting along very well as they cranked out a lot of food at 10:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning in January in Dover.  The other half of this Cheesesteak was hard to give away but the person I gave it to was very excited to have it so that eased my pain, a little.  Great overall experience.  Yes, they got some well deserved \u2018Great People\u2019 points.",

   "This is surely one of the finest restaurants in the neighborhood. Always when I visit this place I am so pleased. They keep their very high  level service and the highest level of cooking  they serve. You are always happy with this restaurant. Warmly  recommended.",
   "My experience at King buffet was GREAT.  I love the atmosphere and the employees are so nice and caring.  Maggie ALWAYS seems to come check on her customers to make sure everything is ok.  I have seen her go out of her way to make sure things are right.  Thank you for the great service that you give.",
   "DO NOT EAT HERE!!!. I expected a restaurant with an average of 4.3 stars to be at least acceptable. King buffet left a bland taste in my mouth with their old and dry assortments of Western dishes. If the owners focused more on affordable Chinese dishes instead of seafood and American dishes then the quality of food will skyrocket as well as keeping food costs down. People are going to take advantage of buffet crab legs as much as possible (even the employees seem to hoard the crab) so save your some money and focus on stocking up fresh, easy, cheaper, and delicious foods that people actually expect from a Chinese buffet. If the food wasn't dry and the assortment more focused then I would visit here again. Please save yourself some time and do not eat here, there's many more options for Chinese here in Dover.",
   "I've been coming to this place since I was a child. Maggie is such a great host she makes you feel welcomed and part of her family. She always greets everyone with a smile and assist with any issues if abay.\nGreat food and just a great atmosphere"

   "How do I begin? -\u2606\n\n I research restaurants before I go in hopes that I'm able to find something good especially since there are not a lot of places in our area. Based on the reviews we willingly  drove 30 minutes away from our home.   I called ahead to ask if they had oxtails. We were told they were in the process of cooking the food  that was at 3:14.  We arrived at 4:08. Walked in very excited as we saw people waiting in line for their food. When we spoke the the lady taking orders we explained that we called ahead for the food and arrived within the time she said it would be done. 1 hour and 22 minutes later  ( I watched two episodes of love it or list it watched countless people come and go In the pouring rain) and after 3 times to check and see if the food was ready. At last the food was done cooking. No apology, no offer of a free beef patty, not even a drink. I get home and expected to be \"Delighted\" in my tropical dish and the first thing we noticed was dry plantains. How  do you mess that up??    The oxtails need to be cooked longer as I was unable to bite, pull or chew on the undercooked meat  (that took me 2 hours to get) \n\nI like to support small business especially since we are in a time that many  businesses are losing money. We even took a menu in hopes to reorder food in the future and share it with friends. \n\nWhen we called to talk to the manager to explain our frustration about the long wait and the fact that the food wasnt even cooked properly they laughed and said sorry we can offer you a free plate. Why would I want more of the same? Or even risk get your extra special sauce included with my next meal? \n\nPlease save your money, go on pinterest,  call a friend make your own food as it would come out faster and taste better then the food that is cooked here. \n\nGlad I own a pressure cooker, I'll see if I'm able to save my $40 meal.",
   "I waited 30 mins for my order and it wasn\u2019t even a busy time. The people are not even friendly at all. They don\u2019t greet you, they don\u2019t smile, they look miserable and they don\u2019t care period! At least let your customers know if there\u2019s going to be a delay on your order right? But of course they won\u2019t. They just take your money and make you wait. Didn\u2019t I say they don\u2019t care? \n\nSo when my food came, they did not apologize for the wait and it was not even hot. I expect that it would be pipping hot because it might be freshly cooked. That might explain my wait but it\u2019s not. My food came drenched in sauce but it was mostly bones with very little meat. This for $16.99 are you kidding me? Look at the photo attached. What a horrible experience and a complete waste of money! DO NOT GO! The one in Loockerman street is way better!",
   "The food is Caribbean style soul food they have lots of great things on the menu. We have used them for catering events. Stop by and pay then a visit it will be well worth your trip",
   "I love the fried chicken and the fried whiting fish. The mac& cheese is very moist with cheese & flavor. The greens are not watered down. Yams and potato pies are very good. There are a storyteller of prices portions are ok only cause you could do much more. The beef patties and tropical food is delicious also. Papa & Mama be breaking it down they be burning \u201c Mr. Dave is keeping it moving and smooth. It\u2019s well worth driving to the other side of town for, go and spend  $ 6 to 12 filling $.",
   "I ordered the ox tails, rice & peas, cabbage with a side of mac & cheese.  This was my 1st purchase. Disappointed that the cabbage was over cooked, very soft. The serving of mac & cheese was an extremely small portion which I paid $3.75 for but only worth 50 cents. It  was dry/hard and and seemed to be leftover scraped from day old pan. The rice was mushy. The rice was mushy. I have been to Jamaica many times and ordered from a number of restaurants in this country.  Worst ever. I know what I should be getting."

It didn't arrive, and I attempted calling the business over 10 times, with 3 of those times going to voicemail. Assuming the business was closed, attempted to cancel the order and get a refund. Still nothing. At 8:45PM, after cooking a meal at home and eating, we recieved a knock at the door with cold Chipotle. It had a tag that had been written saying the order was ordered at 6:30PM and delivered at 7:00PM. \n\nWe didn't receive our order at any reasonable time, was not notified of any delay, and there was still no communication from them. If I could, I would rate this as zero stars, as this is ridiculous! \n\nThe only thing we want is a refund for an order that was over an hour and a half late and was colder than room temperature on arrival that we didn't need or want anymore. Tried calling to speak with a manager after we received the order, and yet again it went unanswered.\n\nUpdate: was contacted by the corporation and was refunded the amount spent. Raised the Stars in the review to reflect this corporate service."

   "You really can't beat the buy one get one free deal. The roast turkey is my go-to. It's always delicious, especially with some mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. The meat loaf is also decent. I like that you can order online and pick it up in 10 - 15 mins. They're always really fast.",
   "It was an enjoyable experience and the food was very good. I was disappointed with the time and a accuracy of them taking my orders. The treatment of some patrons vic others was very noticeable.",
   "The food was hot and fresh. The wait staff was courteous and the restaurant was clean and well maintained",
   "First time going to this Boston Market location and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The food was fresh and everything they have for sides was there to pick from. Good cooking not fast food stop by and enjoy."

   "Parking was easy, the restaurant had plenty of spaces surrounding the building.\nThis is a small stand alone restaurant just off Rt 13, about 5 miles from the Air Force Base. The place was clean inside with many booths, and a few tables. The floor was slippery, like it was greased down. Be careful folks! Service was excellent, anything we needed, we had in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nI ordered a bottled water to drink, cold, refeshing.\n\nChips & Salsa!!!\nChips...good flavor, a little on the stale side, but decent.\nSalsa...the red had good fresh flavors, not as much cilantro as I like, and had a punch of fire for a few seconds. The green was fresh, refreshing, with a small touch of heat. I preferred the green and used it on everything.\n\nI ordered chicken flautas: served with refried beans, rice, and salad.\nThe flautas were fried perfectly, chicken was seasoned well, moist, and tender. I prefer when they toss the salad on top of everything, and this salad was pretty lacking in size for 5 taquitos.\nBeans...almost a soupy consistency, tasted good, solid refried bean game.\nRice...sticky, a bit dry, but serviceable. Mix them both to make it all right.\n\nI ordered tacos choosing chorizo, lengua, and steak. They were out of pastor, so I was a bit sad.\nChorizo...wow!!! excellent char, melt in your mouth, flavor explosion. This was my fav chorizo taco on the journey so far. Outstanding!!!\nLengua...cut into small cubes, seasoned well, just wasn't doing it for me today. The green salsa helped me get though the couple bites I took. I'm hit or miss on the tongue, not today.\nSteak...seasoned flawlessly, not too salty, you can taste the steak, and wasn't dry at all. The tortillas were good and had a little crunch to them.\n\nI ordered a pork tamale.\nIt was wrapped in a banana leaf and had some of the fire red sauce in with the pork and masa. It was ok...quite dry, and the red sauce made it less enjoyable. Not my kind of tamale.\n\nI ordered a carnitas sope.\nI enjoyed it. The meat had excellent flavor, and a solid mix of meat to fat ratio. It could've used more refried beans spread on the tortilla. I used my beans, and it was much better. The tortilla was a little tougher than I prefer, but was still pretty dang good.",
   "So yeah, La Delicia makes me think \"delicious\". Except not in reality.\n\nThe counter person was not personable at all, shading towards unfriendly. \nAs for the food:  for starters, too much salt in their cooking. Salt should enhance and no more.  They went a bit heavy.\n\nWe had chicken, steak, carnitas, and lengua tacos The lengua was a bit tough and gamey.  The carnitas was fine, wife disliked the chicken and steak was okay.\n\nThere was also a burrito that should have been pork, but was chicken. \n\nThe chicken tamale was not good at all, and went unfinished.\n\nWe asked for both the red and green salsa, 2 small containers were provided.  (picture enclosed) The red had decent spice, green was flavorful.\n\nLastly was the grease....ye gods, was this greasy. (pic enclosed showing some)\n\nSome people liked this place, so maybe our experience was an aberration.  I won't chance it.",
   "I love their enchiladas the only thing I wish is that they be more helpful to people not familiar to authentic mexican. I know I look like I could be spanish, but I'm not. Feel like your expected to know the menu already.",
   "This place is on point. The food was incredibly good.  It had great flavor, good portions for the money as well.  I had the tacos; al pastor, chorizo, & lingua as well as the chicken tamale and the fried plantains.",
   "Delicious food! The staff is friendly and welcoming.  I was introduced to their pineapple juice that they make fresh with a few other fruits   I'd come back just for a large cup of that!"

   "Very hole in the wall feeling! Seating for around 10 but from reading other reviews is seems many people take it to-go.\n\nI had an omlet, which was very tasty! Reminded me of home cooking.\n\nWould suggest stopping by if you are looking for something unique. Not expensive at all.",
   "Cobblestone Cafe is a very quaint restaurant. It is located at The Green in Dover DE which is full of rich history. It is run by its owner and there is a steady stream of business from the local offices. Most customers take their food to go but there is a tiny place to sit and eat which is recommended if you can. If only to watch the people come in and out. The food is tasty. A fun place to visit.",
   "Tiny hidden gem. Excellent  service, fresh, tasty food, and super cheap too! Charming decor with dolls, tea sets, and nick nacks.\n\nDetails: it is tiny as it can only seat about 8-10 people.) Small menu that includes breakfast (omelettes and bagels) and lunch (hot dog (beef frank), grilled cheese, a few sandwhiches.) Good coffee. Great service.",

   "The food is constantly well prepared and tasty, cashiers provides excellent service. I love how neat it is and ambience. Will visit here again.",
   "I've always loved Pizzadili as the quality of their food has been second to none. However, last night we ordered a pizza for the first time. It was pretty bad. I'm  certain it is prepackaged with a biscuit-like crust and mediocre sauce. It was so bad that I think they should take pizza off their menu. Now their subs and sandwiches have always been really delicious. But maybe last night was truly an off night. I ordered a cheeseburger sub. It was all roll and very little meat and no cheese!! Add-ons were meager: a little bit of lettuce, a few thin slices of tomato, hardly any onion and a light spread of mayo on the roll. It was the driest, dullest sub I've ever had. I had to doctor the second half of it. So disappointing.",

   "We saw this online and saw the awesome menu and pictures of the food and environment. Well apparently they moved 8 months ago from that location and changed the menu. It took an hour for me to get a breakfast sandwich. They had live music which was cool but was way to loud for the tiny restaurant. It actually hurt my ears. Though the band was extremely talented. The food was good however they forget the cheese which is a dollar more. The menu is completely different that what\u2019s online. There\u2019s half as many items and the price is literally double. My meal online was $5.50 and in there was $9. It also appeared to be under construction as it was pretty junky. What you see online is completely opposite from what\u2019s actually there. I\u2019d give it another chance if the goal it to restore to what they use to have that was giving them so many positive reviews. I give 2 stars as the food was great. Also it wasn\u2019t busy when we went. We were the only ones who didn\u2019t have food and it still took an hour which doesn\u2019t make sense.",
   "We all know Dover isnt that great, but if you are craving a bite to eat..please take the time to fill up here. This is the place. The food, the atmosphere, and the people. ",
   "Very clean restaurant and staff is very friendly. This was my first time trying grits and my server went out of his way to explain what grits were like. Additionally, the restaurant was very clean and aesthetically pleasing with art made by local artists. Highly recommend others check it out!",
   "Great food, and cool events. \n\nOut of most of the places downtown, The BnL seems to be one of the few trying to cultivate a homegrown art scene. They have a open mic reading series, occasional music acts and art work for sale on all the walls. I wish them luck because it's a great endeavor!",
   "Incredible food! From the perfectly seasoned home fries to the equally impressive and delicious Brunch and Lunch burger, this is a must go restaurant when in Dover."

   "Five stars for a five-star experience! I want to give a huge shout out of appreciation to the Dover MOD Pizza team.\n \nThis evening my family utilized their online ordering services. The system was incredibly user-friendly, and the in-house service was equally as excellent. The experience exceeded all expectations for a casual pizza dinner - the pizzas were delicious and prepared without error (something that seems to be a difficult task for most).\n \nIt's important to note that the restaurant was bustling when I came to pick up my order. However, despite the rush, the team made it a point to welcome me as I entered the restaurant warmly, and their customer service never gave way to the crowd. It's the little things that create a great experience.\n \nKudos to the team and their management, who cultivate an environment where excellent customer service is a priority for their team. Keep up the GREAT work!",
   "First time at Mod pizza and it was great.  Nice decor and very clean.  Staff were friendly and engaging, and patient with the kids ordering.  Pizza was really good, cooked in a real oven not on a conveyor.  We'll definitely be back.",
