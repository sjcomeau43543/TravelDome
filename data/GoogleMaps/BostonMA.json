I would advise anyone visiting,  to remember that there are private homes surrounding the reservoir.  Please be respectful.",

We always stop and linger against the old stone walls of the pump house which get warmed by the Sun and whose Stone arches provide protection from the wind so you can really soak in the rays. A great winter walking spot.",

I work for a medical company in Lexington MA and I travel there once a month where Zaaki food truck offers best quality food for the company\u2019s employees. I didn\u2019t have any cash with me but the debit card and the debit card machine wasn\u2019t working. The gentlemen who was taking food orders told me not to worry about the money. He requested to just enjoy the food and pay money to a needy people instead whenever I can. He offered me free food because his debit card machine wasn\u2019t working and I didn\u2019t have any cash. I asked him to give me his address so I can send a check when I go back to Nashville TN but he said it\u2019s ok and not to worry about it. I now believe that there still kind people live in this world. \nI just want to say thank you for the food it was absolutely delicious. Thank you!",

The crispy chicken and beef buns are the best item on the menu. I will order from Bess\u2019s again and highly recommend them to friends.",
  "Little Chinese restaurant that seems to be family owned (not sure). We ordered the pork belly buns ($8), the beef scallion pancake/wrap ($8), and a spicy noodle soup ($12).  Was really excited for the deep fried buns but they happened to be out when we went.\n\nFood came out quickly, and the beef scallion pancake was great! However, in the future, I will steer clear of the pork belly buns. The pork belly was fatty but far more chewy/rubbery than melt-in-your-mouth as I expected. They have other filling options like chicken, etc., which may be better (haven't tried). My friend had the noodle soup, which was nice and he enjoyed.\n\nMight come back for the deep fried buns but not sure! Felt a bit overpriced for the quality, but maybe I would feel differently about a different selection.",

( you can park on the street ) \nThe restaurant is small but clean. Especially the bathroom... is spotless!! The food was absolutely delicious!!!\nWe try the Dan Dan Noodles ( the best I ever had ) Beef Wrap & Pork Belly Bun ( full of the favor )  and the best is the DUMPLING !!! She cooked really well and fresh. \nI highly recommend it. Me and my friend will coming here again. \nThanks for the good food!!!"

  "I love this place. I have been coming every Thursday since I found out they had finally opened. It's got the Japanese equivalent of pub food and makes it well. The options are all refreshingly authentic (to an American with limited knowledge, mind you) and delicious. The sushi options are wonderful and they have everything you could want to tailor to your tastes. They do one with a braised tuna and olive oil that is to die for, but that may be the Italian bias in me. The only thing that falls flat is their ramen, which is only redeemed by the fact that there are so many other tasty things to eat instead. I even made a friend while sitting at the large table with a stranger. The wait staff is also wonderful and kind, they work very hard and it shows. They even remember me when I come in now. The food is quick, but it helps that I go at an off-time. Please show this business some love, they deserve it",
  "If you've never tried Yakitori, you're in for a treat. Think of the most delectable kabobs you've ever had and multiply it by 50. I recommend the bacon-wrapped scallops for newcomers. Grab a pitcher of Sapporo with your mates and settle in for a great night!",

We had some apps to started with, both beef with enoki and grilled squid are tasty and good. The sushi was amazingly fresh and delicious. \nThe service was excellent. Our waitress was super nice and friendly. Overall this is a great restaurant to hang out with friends. We will come back to try out their Omakase and yakitori selections!",

It's of the Americanized Chinese food variety. \n\nThis place also sells some packaged Chinese snacks (like shrimp crackers).  \n\n",

  "First time coming here. I used the app and ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich and it was ready by the time I got there (I got there ~8 minutes after I placed my order). Here they toasted the croissant, which I appreciate. Some other locations don't do this and it makes the sandwich feel soggy. Overall, the service is good and the inside is clean.",
  "Great location! Wish it were something other than Dunkin Donuts. I did buy a donut and chatted with the friendly staff; the fact that they dropped the word 'donuts' from their name should have been a warning to me. Still, I hope this store does well; this corner could really use a boost.\nPS, the storefront could use some more street appeal; so easy to walk right by the place.",

  "Again, a place where you can drop all pretence, open your heart and get some delicious food at unbelievably affordable price. Snobs putting strong emphasis on scale/class/professionalism might want to avoid. I always rate those criteria critically where they apply. Here, it's a different spirit altogether. So with humility have the joy of trying the fabulous empanadas, the grilled half chicken...and many others. I insist that you try those traditional stuff first rather than the pizzas and burgers only.",

The place has a good vibe, servers were friendly and quick. I ordered the morning madness. It comes with a choice of eggs, sausages (awesome!), house fries and toast. It was a good sized portion and did very well as a brunch. My friend got blueberry pancakes, which were delicious as well. Overall it was a good experience. I would recommend either going a little early in the morning to beat the crowd or having ample of time cushion.",

One thing I was extremely happy to see were the tamales on the menu and enjoyed the chicken tamale immensely - that is something that can be hard to find up north. Seating is limited but it is a great location for take out. Well worth your time and money to stop by.",

  "The food is amazing but don't expect to choose most of your ingredients.",
  "Great place, they take food very seriously and they won't ever lower their quality. They use not so common ingredients for their food that make the flavor unique and totally worth the prices. Given the fact that they just raised the prices recently after 5 YEARS, because they care more about the experience of having GREAT, HEALTHY AND ALL NATURAL FOOD, than the revenue. Keep in mind, that for you to have the best, they have pay premium too and it gets to a point where you refuse to bring down your quality just to save a few cents. \n\nAlso, reading the comments about the menu not being clear or prices not being listed...THEY ARE! They don't like their business to be misunderstood and they explain in all the menus the prices for \"upgrade\" meats, how much it will be extra for each dish you might get those meats with. There is nothing wrong with asking questions when in doubt, it is way better than assuming!\ud83d\ude0a"

  "I recently followed a -grammer who said this place is better than Kung Fu and just a notch shy of Gong Cha. That was enough to pique my interest, so on a spectacularly warm March day, we decided to walk to Boba Me in Mission Hill. The space is open and well-lit, and there are nice games like Jenga, etc. on the tables for you to play while sipping your boba. We got the black sugar boba, 25% and it was really tasty. The boba were a bit on the smaller side, and less gelatinous and more chewy, and just a tad sweet -- all in all, very yummy. The tea itself was also quite good, although light on the tea flavor and heavy on the molasses. I actually loved the smokey, spicy bite of the molasses but I could see it being a little bit much for people who are more used to traditional milk tea.\n\nWe also couldn't resist the flaming hot Cheetos crinkle cut fries. While I'm pretty sure they're just microwavable fries topped with crushed flaming hot Cheetos dust and sour cream and cheese, it was AMAZING. Slightly spicy, crunchy, greasy, and yummy; good portion size too.\n\nAll in all, we paid $10 for the two items and enjoyed ourselves a lovely game of Jenga. I'll be back!",
  "Nice staff, clean place but all the drinks are made with powders. I expected fresh fruit for the mango smoothie but it's all powder!!!!",
  "I\u2019d be happy with any new boba tea place in the neighborhood but this is an excellent one. Friendly service, cute environment and amazing tea. Will be back!",
  "Not a lot of food but there's a wide variety of flavors of tea. Additional toppings such as boba, jelly, popping pearls, etc. add an additional 50 cents. They added Vietnamese (iced and hot) coffee, a Vietnamese type of sandwich, and flaming hot fries. They're soon adding ice cream (flavors(3): Vanilla, Ube, ???(Maybe chocolate or strawberry)). I love the black rose tea drink with additional lychee jelly. It's sweet and the lychee jelly has a very nice chew. Also, you can ask for a cup of any topping for 50 cents! It's only about 1/4 of the cup, though. Nice decorations and they have table games you can play with friends. Modern caf\u00e9-like aura.",

  "Update: the quality has deteriorated over the time and it\u2019s no more the place I described previously as below but still it\u2019s worth try there once.\nBest and reasonable North Indian food in nearby area. The taste is good and they prepare many food fresh like bread and Kababs infront of you. Since many food is prepared fresh, there would be some waiting time. I vote like second best Indian/Pakistan cuisine at Boston. The proprietor 8s very friendly and they take your feedback too. Very reasonable price and nicely located near by public transport. If you want to try Indian/Pakistani food at Boston, today's date this is the best according to their location, quality, quantity and price.",

  "I can\u2019t get enough Nachlo! The food is amazingly delicious and the employees are some of the most kind and caring people I\u2019ve ever met. Walking in, you immediately feel like you\u2019re at home. Everyone is incredibly kind and welcoming and then you get to eat the tastiest food on top of that! Everything on the menu is amazing! Chicken seekh kabobs, biriyani, chicken tikka are all must haves!Always be sure to ask if they have anything off menu for the day (they usually have at least one secret item!) and don\u2019t forget to get creative by blending Mexican and Pakistani foods! Butter chicken burrito, burrito wrapped in naan, seekh kabob naan wraps, etc... the options are deliciously endless!!!",
  "I have been looking forward to trying this place since I walked by and saw the concept before they opened - and now that I have tried it I can say for sure that it was worth the wait! The inside is inviting and has a few different spots to sit (with more seating downstairs). The food was what I really appreciated though, it felt like everyone working there put their own flair and heart into the food. At first glance, the food doesn't appear to be \"fusion\" so much as either Pakistani or Mexican (with the different cuisines having their own respective sides of the menu), but what really brought them both together were the homemade sauces. I tried the Chile de Arbol (their spiciest sauce offering) on both the quesadilla and the Chapli Kabab and it was delicious with everything they offered. I also got the Chicken Curry which was well spiced and expertly prepared. Those three plates were definitely more than enough for two people, but I'm glad I was able to try them all.\nOverall, the staff was inviting and the food delicious, leaving me excited to come back as soon as I can! Can't wait to recommend this new restaurant to my friends in the area as well!"

Then the \u2018restaurant\u2019 ... it\u2019s a cluttered room no more than 10x10 with this guy lounging in an easy chair and talking on the phone. He was very chill and polite. He showed me into the kitchen which was ... I don\u2019t know. There were four metal cafeteria serving trays. Cassava leaf, cray cray, and two rice. He gave me some of each. They both have chunks of chicken full of bits of bone, so eat carefully. He asked if I wanted to eat here. I didn\u2019t see any place to do that, so I paid (do I need to say bring cash?), and went on my way. \nIt was worth going for the experience. I can\u2019t really say if the food was good, having nothing to compare it to.  I\u2019m glad I went, but I won\u2019t go again-especially because I don\u2019t live in Boston.",

  "Went in here for the first time and it looked a really nice place.  The staff was friendly but the service was a bit slow.  It was a busy night. However, the food came at a reasonable time.  The food was really good. Portion sizes are reasonable.  \nHowever when paying, there is already a 15% service charge already included in your total.  And then the option to tip comes up too.  So you're basically tipping twice.  So check with your server before paying to be sure.",
  "I walked in and there was no waiter readily available. I waited 2 minutes before being waited on. The manager saw me and didn't even acknowledge my presence. I ordered moi moi and plantain ($7 menu item), which totaled to $8.54 after a hefty 15% service tax. The food was not good. The moi moi tasted like rubber. The waiter, nor manager did not even offer me water until I was done with my meal and requested the check. They offered other patrons water as soon as they were seated. The food is mainly Nigerian, so SUYA isn't about \"African cuisine\".\n\nOverall, poor service, poor quality food, expensive food, and poor/little variety. It's a major major no go!",
  "Ordered food online at close to 7pm... they close at 8pm... 4 DoorDash drivers went there in separate occasions to pick my food up and the food was not... Never got it and the restaurant eventually cancelled the order after I waited for over an hour. Their services is probably the worst in Massachusetts but good food though.",
  "So its after 9 PM on a Thursday.  My friend and I are hungry and  places are starting to close. We walk in and their dining room is closed but they offer to do a togo order. After we explain that our hotel is far away and we have no place to eat they let us sit at the bar and order. \n\nThe food was delicious. I have never had any of these stew dishes before. The peanut stew was a little sweet. It reminded me of peanut butter cookies. Very tasty. The vegetable stew was a little spicy and had a strong seafood flavor. Again very good. \n\nI don't know of I will get to go back. We are not local. But if you need an inviting welcoming place to get a tasty meal definitely check out Suya.",
  "Love this West African (mostly Nigerian) restaurant. Food is great, and their meat patties make for a nice snack. Friendly staff, who are eager to please, and good conversationalists to boot. If you love African food and are in the Roxbury area, definitely check them out."

Second,  unlike all other Caribbean restaurants in the area where the customer service is nonexistent, the actually have some. They say hello when you walk in the door, don't seemed annoyed because they are at work. Very friendly to say the least. And don't leave with out a pack of patties. They have like a few different kinds but I like the jerk chicken and the shrimp. I would like to take half a star away because of the limited drink selection. 4 and half stars.",

  "Great restaurant with authentic taste and vibes. This is the spot the local Somalis go to eat GOOD FOOD first and foremost. This is the epitome of mom and pop shop. All food is made to order fresh. Oh and did I mention that they have the best Halwa (Somali dessert treat) rivaling the infamous Halwa Kismayo from Minnesota.",

  "This cafe has my very favorite iced coffee and it's just as good late in the day as it is in the morning. Also, they sell an incredible bean pie in the cooler. It's a sweet pie and it's delicious. Good for sharing with a couple of friends, great with coffee.",

  "Excellent food and service.   Soothing music pleasant place to bring your laptop and relax.  Surprisingly peaceful experience!",
  "Unprofessional. They don't answer the phone during business hours, don't update their web pages when business hours change, and don't take customer feedback. Idiots run this place.",

  "The go to place for authentic Somali food. If you like lots of flavor and local, ethnic restaurants, go to Deria. ",
  "The most authentic Somali food I have ever had...and their Halwa is the best...even better than Halwa Khismayo",
  "The food is ok--not great, but good enough and its cheap. My issue with this place is the lack of basic professionalism. The staff are cold, slow, and prone to ignoring customers. Their posted business hours are incorrect. As others have noted, there's also issues with how well the place is maintained. The options for Somali food in Boston are limited so this place has a captive customer base to an extent, but I personally will not be going back. I don't need to spend my money at a place where they feel totally comfortable ignoring you when you're waiting at the counter to pay.",

The place is a bit small but it doesn't bother me. The only downside is sometimes certain foods weren't available. There was one time, I wanted morcilla. There was none available. I had drove from Roxbury to Boston just for it. The guy felt bad & didn't want to disappoint so he quickly made us some. Either way, there's moriclla (as I've previously mentioned) chicharrones, platanos fritos, arroz con gandules, yucca, pernil, etc. It's a lovely place & the decorations are nice as well.",

  "This was our first visit to Victoria\u2019s and was amazing. The staff was extremely friendly and efficient. The menu is large, unlike their prices and the food is really good. I highly recommend the chili!!! The chicken fingers and fries awesome. The fries are made with good quality potatoes and are thick and slightly salted.",
  "It's a long-standing diner that's been around since 1949. Great variety of food offerings from breakfast and burgers to sandwiches and steaks. Service is usually very prompt and it's opened  24 hours so you can get breakfast or desserts anytime. Parking is available either in their lot or on surrounding streets. Decor is typical for a diner, casual and quite spacious with a dining area in back. Prices are reasonable.",
  "I usually come here for omelets. Their portions are big and their home fries are bomb! This time I had the plant-based Impossible Burger and it was pretty good!  I had a carnivor try it and he gave it a seal of approval.\n\nService is always consistently good here. Food as well",
  "Great service and professional personnel who takes care of you all the time. I was there on few breakfasts and did not regret it at all. Food is tasty and always fresh and the coffee cup is always filled with tasty coffee. Place is big enough to fit loads of of people too.",
  "We got there around 3 am. We were in a group of 6 people. Because we arrived in two groups the manager didn't allowed us to sit all together. They even told us that if we had arrived all at the same time they would.be able to place us in the same table. In addition, the place wasn't even full, it had less then 30% of its capacity. We were very polite with them and nothing changed."

  "Been here tonight for dinner and the first thing that comes to mind is how huge this place is. It doesn\u2019t seem like a large place till you get in. The decor and lighting are perfect. There are some new $5 cocktails and drinks on the menu. They forgot to put mint in my mojito which I had to politely remind. My friend ordered a strawberry margarita which was splendid. \n\nBeing a vegetarian, I was short of options for food but whatever we ordered did taste real good. The molten chocolate cake is the best out of all the desserts here. We also ordered a tiramisu which came in frozen and it actually took effort to break it. We returned it back. Quite odd for a chain that specializes in Italian cuisine to mess up with an iconic dessert. Apart from that I found the prices to be reasonable but they could do a bit more portion wise. I would definitely recommend a visit.",
  "Super busy on Saturday but the wait wasn't too bad. About a half hour. The waitress came right over and took our order. Got drinks, salad and bread sticks quick! Food was really good. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it took a good 15 minutes to have the waitress give us our check. Other than that a nice dinner and experience",
  "Unfortunately this review is for this location as it is been largely a mixed bag there. I've been approximately 10 times in the last 4 years. We have had a few bad experiences that almost turned me/us off. Ultimately the food is good for the price and I enjoy the soup and bread sticks, always gets me.",
  "Great meal, way better than I expected. The meal was amazing the wait staff was phenomenal. And the price was excellent. I took my whole family there and we all came out happy and full. I will definitely visit Olive Garden again next time I am in Dorchester.",

It's too bad.\n\nThere is plenty of parking right outside.",

  "Considering this was the only bakery 2 steps away from our hotel, we got curious & gave it a shot: and I guess we were in luck - service was ok both days we had breakfast there. On the first day it really took a while till we got the bagels (we were told they had some trouble in the kitchen), but on the second day we just ordered \"to go\" and they stepped on it - & the sandwiches were fine - maybe a bit too small (according to my husband). \nWhat I particularly liked: the delicious muffins!"
