   "Magical winter wonderland in Montpelier, VT. Be sure to stop by if you ever visit Vermont. We were in awe at all the beauty of this fabulous forest covered in snow. Definitely recommend a visit to this place.",
   "Beautiful trails lead from downtown to historic towers to deserted forests, there is a trail for every ability level, and friendly knowledgeable locals with their great dogs",
   "Love walking the different trails watch out for the snakes love the wild life and so close to town",
   "Great park. Plenty of space for a game, a walk, or even just a place to get peace and quiet. Some days have more dogs than others. As long as I've been in town I haven't seen any litter in this park.",

   "This is one of the coolest places I have ever been to. Visiting from Canada, the tour was excellent. Learnt a lot about the history of the Legislature. Our tour guide was excellent and he was really funny too. He really cracked us up and made the tour interesting. This is one of the places that if I visit Vermont again, I will surely stop by again.",
   "Magnificent capitol, both from the outside and inside. It's quite picture-worthy, especially at night when the building is lit nicely.\n\nThe free guided tour was very informative. Definitely join one if you are visiting. I was quite surprised to learn that the legislature only meets for about four months in a year, during the first quarter! We were able to visit the legislative halls since there were no on-going sessions. At the end of the tour, visitors can stay and head to the cafeteria for food and drinks. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful, especially the ladies at the gift shop.\n\nIf you don't have time for the tour, you can check out the virtual tour on their website.",
   "Visited here during a weekday, and the entrance was free! We were given audio devices and maps the explore the whole House. Beautiful architecture!",
   "Quintessential building with history lessons in every step. Well worth the visit.",
   "I loved visiting the Vermont State House! When I arrived on Saturday, I wasn't expecting to be able to go inside or take a tour, but I'm glad they were open. The docent was outstanding and the building, beautiful! I recommend stopping if you have free time."

   "Nice small museum. It will be great to see that even this museum dosen't charge any visitor fee like other Museums in US.",
   "We got in for free during an event day offering free admission which was really great for us. We travel full time so paying for tons of museums and outings can add up. It\u2019s a small museum but decently done. I do wonder if there could be a little more local vermont history or more detailed history Added around. Some was more broad and general stuff that most anyone would know. Sure sheep and cows and such were used for farming. But I would have liked a little more in depth history on things and how things were done in vermont compared to other states. How roads were carved and built in and through/around the mountains. History of covered bridges, maple farms, quarries etc. but I also admit I was a bit rushed on a time crunch before closing so it is possible I rushed pass some of these things without realizing. \n\nOverall it was a nice museum and laid out in a horseshoe so it was easy to walk through. But this is a huge building. It would be nice to have more floors of history to explore. Looking at the pricing it seems fairly priced for what is here. $7 an adult, $5 kids and seniors and under 6 free, $20 for families. \n\nI also bought some nice postcards in the giftshop.",
   "Small, but really well done museum describing Vermont history from the time of early human settlement to the present day.  I found the section on colonial and early American history especially interesting, especially given the complicated and often strained relationship that Vermonters have had with New York, New Hampshire, and the Crown.  Takes about an hour to go through and it is well worth the time and money.",
   "Nice visit to add along with a tour of the state house.",
   "Thoughtful and interesting historical displays.   Lots of historical artifacts arranged in relevant groups to illustrate Vermont's rich heritage: colonial settlers, land disputes between Grant's and Yorkers, native American heritage, wars,  industrialization,  railroads, everyday life and art... and much more.  Wish we left enough time to visit more than just the first floor."

   "We had a great time today visiting this winery at the owners home. We tried a superb variety of white and red wines. The owner was very interesting and  knowledgeable  on wine making.  He introduced us to some tasty hard apple cider with a delicious wine jelly on crackers.",
   "Our experience here was incredible! A small, off-road adventure just a few miles from downtown Montpelier led us to one of the best wine tastings we\u2019ve had in New England. The owner gave impeccable descriptions of his wine and took such pride in the making of it. It\u2019s rare to find people who have followed their true passion and I can say this owner certainly has! As Californians we have high expectations for wine tasting and this winery met all of them. If you\u2019re even passing through Montpelier it is worth a stop!",
   "Not only is the wine and cider awesome, but the owner is extremely informational about winemaking. He also has a very interesting background. This winery is definitely worth the trip! Also, don't be put off by the fact that it's run out of a house :-)",
   "We visited John at North Branch for a wine-tasting on a Friday afternoon and he spent almost an hour talking to us about his wines and vineyards, and then gave us a detailed tour through his wine-making operation. It was a very enjoyable and informative experience, and the wine is absolutely phenomenal."

It's not a long walk to the service booth or activities. \n\nBring your charcoal and grill a lunch under the trees but bring a trash bag for your mess. Swimming and frisbee golf had a reasonable fee but it's obvious the money goes right back into maintaining the grounds! \n\n The bathrooms are pretty plain with a concrete floor and some old but well maintained bathroom fixtures. If you need modern accommodations, the restrooms may leave you dissatisfied but we found them clean and well maintained. Some funding toward bringing this area will lock in the five star rating. \n\nThank you to the people and organizations that maintain this area so well; I'm looking forward to many more trips here and feel this place has set the bar high as a standard other places to model.",

Westaff did a great job educating usabout cheese differences, the process for making cheese and what each member of the family could eat without having to worry. It's great to be supporting this co-op of family farms and the great staff here. Looks like a specialty grocery store (and it is) but it's also a fabulous tourist stop. Come in and delight the entire family!",

There also is a very Large selection of higher end specialty items. A very nice visit Recommend to all.",

Snowmobile Vermont gave us a coupon for a free apple cider donut so we decided to check it out. \n\nThe store is absolutely beautiful anything Vermont related items you can think of they had it and the apple cider donut was one of the best I\u2019ve ever tasted! \n\nI took away 2 stars because the cashing out experience was lacking. The woman that assisted us didn\u2019t greet us at all or acknowledge us standing there waiting to be checked out. Finally we get called over and we\u2019re cashing out (we purchased about 20 dollars worth of stuff). I showed her the coupons and she looked like wasn\u2019t happy about seeing the coupon. She just took them scanned them and gave us our items. Customer service plays a big role in any business and I do feel that in this area it was inadequate.",
   "Those apple cider donuts are just one of the many incredible things offered by this place. Food and baked goods are just so hearty and yes, fresh. We liked their coffee and sandwiches. The different Vermont goods offered are so delicious and tell a story. A must visit place and an experience",
   "Cold Hollow Cider Mill is worth a visit for delicious apple cider and cider donuts. You can watch how the crushed apples are made into cider through a window for free. Cider (not hard cider) samples are also free and self-serve. Souvenirs and food products (e.g. maple, honey) are also sold here. Definitely a great shop for gifts. \n\nThe cider donuts  was delicious, denser cake-like donut. Best enjoyed with some apple cider. \n\nMy friend used a purchase of $25 voucher to get half a dozen donuts. We chose to just get 3 donuts, since we wouldn\u2019t be able to finish it.",
   "The store is a wonderful place to visit for cider, maple syrup, jam, and other lovely quintessentially Vermont products.  HOWEVER, and it is a big however, there is a working heating stove on the floor in the middle of the store, which was extremely hot the day I visited this past weekend.  The stove is sitting directly on the floor blasting heat with no screen, gate, or other protection for the customers.  \n\nI had no idea the stove was even there when I was walking around the store with my toddler son.  He was not running or being disruptive and was never more than a few feet away from me.  We turned a corner and before I even noticed the stove on the floor, my son has walked a few steps and put his hand directly on the hot glass, which again was not blocked or protected by anything.  He immediately screamed and took his hand off the glass, but by then he had received second-degree burns on all of this little fingers.  He has suffered greatly this week and remains at risk of infection. \n\nGranted, we left the store very quickly to take him to an urgent care clinic, but no store employee approached us to see if he was ok.  I then called the store this past Monday to inform them of the accident and kindly request that they place a screen or some sort of gate in front of this extremely hot stove easily accessible by anyone walking through the store and at perfect child height.  I was told I would receive a call from the owner the next day, but have not yet received one. \n\nI remain shocked that this stove is left unprotected out in the open of a very family-oriented store and at the lack of care the staff and owners have showed us.  Needless to say, I won't be returning, and I urge visitors, especially with young children, to watch out for the stove."

   "This campground is everything you could ever want in a state run park. It's gorgeous and heavily wooded, situated on the shores of the Waterbury Reservoir. Most sites have waterfront views and some even have water access. They sell firewood and ice (block and cubed). If you have exact change you can help yourself any time of day. Super friendly staff, very helpful. This is now my go to car camping park in Vermont.",
   "Absolutely beautiful place to camp in the fall , I drove up here to celebrate my 30th birthday all by myself . All the sites have what I would call a great view , bathrooms in walking distance and the shower takes quarters , and the pressure and hot water both work great! Picnic table and fire pit on site , more private sites are available for anyone interested. I can't wait to try this place in the summer !",
   "Little River was a fantastic camping place! You can buy firewood and ice from the site. Each camp site has it's own fire pit, many have a grate to make grilling or cooking over the fire easier. We were in spot 51 that had a really pretty view of the water but we were kinda close to neighbors on each side. Would definitely return to camp again. Theres so many trail hiking options as well.",
   "Hiked only. The trail we were on was in good condition even though it was not blazed .  Drove around the campsites and made us want to camp again.  This place is pretty awesome, though around the rivers, it can get very buggy. Employees were very friendly. FYI, It does take awhile to get to this park from the main road even though it is only 3 miles off it, it\u2019s mostly a dirt road.",
   "Best state park. Best. Cabins are particularly nice, and each of the car camping spots feel private and wild, despite being numerous. The History Hike is a favorite, and the Stevenson Brook Trail has some really cool water and rocks. The springtime high water is pretty impressive as well, and makes for tough crossings where required and where no bridge is present."

I highly recommend.",

Mad River Glen has continued to provide a haven of natural beauty and a variety of technical and enjoyable terrain for any skill level on skis.",

I started out on a snowboard and then switched to \ud83c\udfbf for only $5, so I was able to try both. Personal I had more fun on the snowboard, but thought the \ud83c\udfbf would be easier for me because they are for most people. Only about 30 minutes from S. Burlington and was easy to find. Would love to try the trails when I get more experience under my belt, but still had fun learning how to \ud83c\udfbf on my own...",

We had fun night skiing on Friday and had our Welcome Party at the Village Cafe. Everything was lovely, the food was great and the staff friendly. Nice Mountain for children and teens. Ski terrain is limited but there is something for everyone. Lots of green and light blue on the lower half of the mountain.",
   "Bolton employees were extremely friendly and helpful.  My group arrived in an RV. We called Customer Services and they sent out one of the employees out to greet us. We were granted 'RockStar' parking considering it was temporary for the day. The skiing/snowboarding is most challenging in the glades.  The glade area closed at 3:30 so you have to make certain you have the plan and time to do it!  Highly recommend.  The view from the top is amazing!  Overlooking Lake Champlain and NY State was gorgeous.",
   "This mountain is a little gem. I've been skiing the east for 40 years and somehow managed to miss this place. Probably because it is so close to Stowe. I will say it is worth taking a day off from the larger places to check out the sweet cruiser glades of Bolton. I would have given 5 stars if the staff were better. Everyone seems like they are doing you a favor by taking your money and the ski school almost killed my daughter's desire to ski, but other than that, I really liked the mountain.",

The lake, roads and trails are well cared for.  And the view...it's pretty amazing.  If you're renting a house, be sure to get one facing the mountain.  And with a hot tub if you can.  Nothing better than jumping out into the cold water then back again.  The park itself has a great hiking trail to firehouse tower.

If you're into 10-30' cliff jumps, the gorge has got some 'daring' options. Water is super clear, and very refreshing. \n\nUpper and lower gorge is recommended for kids and inexperienced swimmers. The risk of undercurrents is almost nonexistent. \n\nThe heart of the gorge is the danger zone. \n\n This place is not for everyone. You need to be hyper aware of water level, and monitor currents as you swim around. I've seen someone drown here. From what I remember, someone has died here almost every summer.\n\nThat being said, in my hundreds of times swimming in all areas of the gorge, I have never experienced a stronger current than I could handle.\n\nBe smart, all will be well"

   "Oh my gosh!  I loved this little roadside detour.  We watched a web be be harvested right in front of our eyes.  Fascinating!",
   "A friend told me about the spider farm when I was driving through Vermont and decided to make an impromptu stop. I am so glad I did! The guy who owns it is in his 80s I think. His son helps him with the \"farm.\" The spider farm was featured in Obscura \u2014 a book and a magazine. \n\nThey feature many different size webs for sale so you will be sure to find something in your price budget. And he told me how they started to make inexpensive wooden items for families with children :-)\n\nIn an adjacent barn, they have windowless panes hanging where the spiders \ud83d\udd77 build webs. They spray the web with paint and then pass a board through thus capturing the web as art. The spiders are also hanging out in the shop which is pretty cool. So don't jump too high if you see one. Haha!\n\nHim and his wife have been doing this for 40+ years. He was a sailor back in the day and he showed me a bunch of rad tattoos that were over 50 years old. \n\nI was thrilled to get a piece of spider web art from the farm!",
   "The owner gave us a very informative and interesting tour (plus she was very charming). There is a very impressive collection of wonderfully preserved spider web masterpieces! It was inspiring to see someone's clear passion and dedication to something they love. PLUS - This HAS to be the world's only Spider Web Farm... How cool is that?!",
   "Awesome spot to visit. Unique, for sure. Ignore the bad review. Realize, spiders aren't always active and enjoy the experience.",

Marilyn found them and put them in a safe place. \nShe followed up with lost and found the next day, tracked us down, and even delivered the items to us an hour and a half away WITH a wonderful story to tell our daughter about one of her racing experiences. Some day our daughter will be sure to pay this forward. \nSmall ski hills are hard to find. Customer service like this is nearly impossible. Thank you Marilyn!!!! We will definitely be back to make some turns when we are in the area.\nSteve",

   "\"Daddy, I want to win a gold medal like Barbara Ann.\" 30-year Cochran's skier here. Come with the right expectation. Cochran's is about kids first, racing second, and everything else third. If you want to tear up steep and deep woods, Cochran's 350' vertical drop isn't for you. But you won't find a cheaper place to ski, thanks largely to the outpouring of community support that Cochran's receives. If you are learning to ski, teaching others to ski, or just like hanging out with Olympians in a historic and convenient and affordable family-friendly environment, then Cochran's is definitely for you.",

Just when you\u2019ve spend 90 minutes and think you\u2019ve been everywhere, you realize you\u2019ve only touched probably 10% of it. It was very satisfying to finally complete it.",

Looking at this order, there doesn't appear any indication to me as to why the shipping would display \"Canceled by Sender\", but I do absolutely see that is the case, and the package did not go anywhere.\"\n\n\"We would be happy to issue a reshipment, if that's something you would still be interested in, and we can absolute have your shipping costs refunded. Would this still be going to the same recipient address that's listed in this order?\n\nThat's it.  That's all they did to correct the situation.  My response:\n\n\"It's not Valentine's Day anymore.  Please issue a refund. Really disappointed. I can't trust you again.\"\n\nI absolutely do not recommend Vermont Teddy Bear.  If there was a way to give them zero stars I would.",
   "Wonderful tour of the facility. Our entire group of adults and kids had a great time. The gift shop was well stocked and so was the snack bar. Restrooms were clean and big enough that there wasn't a line to use them on a busy holiday weekend. Overall really wonderful positive experience.",
   "It took 50 minutes to get a hold of customer service (its valentines so that's not horrible) and the lady I spoke with was very kind and helpful. HOWEVER they lost my order and FOUR HUNDRED other orders on VALENTINES DAY. so now my surprise teddy to my S.O's office wont be delivered until 4 days AFTER valentines day...\n\nLastly if your calling customer service use option 3 and then 3, because option 3 and then 1 leads to a dead line after 6 minutes of waiting on hold.",
   "A must stop during a trip to Burlington. Cute bear cutouts for photos just outside the factory building. The tour is informative and you get cute bear buttons as well as little fur bears to attach. The tour is short so it's great for little kids with short attention spans. They even get to hold bears during a part of the tour. The store was fun too, so many bears to choose from. I got a teddy bear 30 years ago on a family trip and it was so nice to bring the kids to get teddies of their own.",
   "So disappointed.  I ordered on the morning of 2/11/20 and still haven't received a tracking number.  It was supposed to be delivered today (Valentine's Day)  which obviously it won't be.  So glad I paid for the upgraded shipping.  Worst of all if you try to call after 8 minutes the music stops and the phone seems to go dead.  I understand they are busy for the holiday but don't say it will be delivered by x day if you can't make sure it is going to be there."

   "Shelburne Farms is a nonprofit education center for sustainability, 1,400 acres (570 ha) working farm, and National Historic Landmark on the shores of Lake Champlain in Shelburne, Vermont. The property is nationally significant as a well-preserved example of a Gilded Age 'ornamental farm', developed in the late 19th century with architecture by Robert Henderson Robertson and landscaping by Frederick Law Olmsted.",
   "Shelburne Farms is magical. First of all, it's pretty cheap to get in. It's less than $10 per person to spend an entire day here. Once you get your ticket, you can walk to the farm or get transported by a tractor. Since the property is HUGE, I'd wait to be transported.\n\nOnce you're at the massive historic farm that looks more like a castle, you'll be entertained for hours. They have chickens, rabbits, cows, donkeys, horses, sheep...so many animals that you can pet. They have programming throughout the day. Our daughter loved the chicken egg hunting! \n\nThere's a farm-to-table food truck there every day serving burgers, sandwiches, etc. \n\nIn the back of the property is the inn, which is beautiful. \n\nThere's a general store at the entrance/exit that sells jams, honey, and cheese. THE CHEESE! It is AMAZING! Eat all the free samples plus more.",
   "This is a beautiful and outstanding working farm with so many programs going on.I took the cheese tour which showed us all the steps of making their famous cheeses, plus seeing the cows and babies and milking operation.I love how they are committed to sustainable humane clean agriculture and will now buy their products.\nThe farm barn is a beautiful incredible building!",
   "Wonderful place to walk around, enjoy the relaxing time in the park, many events for kids with animals. Taking tracker(shuttle) was also great fun. Having drinks at shelburn farm watching the beautiful sunset was super cool. I appreciate my friends who took me here. We had such great time here.",
   "Such a beautiful place... lots of open spaces and trails to walk. Plenty of great views and places to explore. If you are visiting Vermont, this is definitely something you want to schedule on your itinerary."

Many short hikes. Many more long hikes.  The weather was perfect for hiking (70's) while my fiance and I were visiting. June 9-11. Little chilly at night (40's) but it was not to cold for us in a tent with a hefty sleeping bag. Overall had a very pleasant stay at this camp ground and would certainly return for another visit.",

For example they have a roller coaster, a pool, and much more for Family members that don\u2019t ski. For skiers you have so many options of trails, any ski school lessons for old and young, and amazing chair lifts To keep you warm on the way up the mountain. It is my favorite ski place I\u2019ve ever been in my life.",
   "Skiing Killington in Vermont is the some of the best skiing I've ever experienced. The glades were the best I've ever skied. The downfall was how huge the mountain was (as crazy as that sounds) it was hard to become intimate with the mountain because it was so big. There were so many options, but it was hard to remember where specific glades were or where you were even on the mountain. It took us all 3 days to finally figure it out! Overall though no complaint the people were great, great snow, good lifts and the scanner makes lines a thing of the past. There were 2 great terrain parks while I was there, made by Woodward and Burton! My buddy was hoping they had their big park done when we went (mid January) but due to a warm winter they were just getting started on it. There were great options for all ski levels. Highly reccomend this place. I'm looking forward to comparing east coast mountains to west coast next year (hopefully). Stay tuned... Overall I give this ski mountain a 26/30 only because if you're not there for a couple days you will be lost (there are plenty of maps but you just end up not where you were expecting to be)",
   "I\u2019ve been skiing 3 times so far and I\u2019ve only ever been here. Go big or go home, right? \ud83d\uddfb\ud83c\udfbf The mountain has trained me well, I\u2019m already frequenting the blue square trails! \ud83d\udfe6 Absolutely love the life of this place, super friendly staff, killer mountain and loads of fun all around! It\u2019s an amazing environment, we\u2019ll be back next weekend for sure!",
   "All the recent improvements have added to the skiing experience. Much safer and better for the beginner and intermediate skier. The construction of tunnels has changed the safety of all skiers. The long Great Eastern trail is great for beginners, intermediate and fun for more advanced skiers. The lodges offer excellent food and \u201creasonable \u201c prices. Efficiency at food services excellent. The new lifts have greatly improved the wait times. I truly believe the Killington experience is the best in the East! Jaykap",
   "Visited for the first time this past weekend and had an amazing experience from the rental facilities, ski lessons, customer service, bar service, and more. The lift lines moved quickly and many of the slopes were well groomed even on the warmer days. \n\nOur group had beginner and intermediate skiiers and everyone could find a trail or slope to keep them challenged but not overwhelmed. The efficient shuttle system from the lodge to the hotel was also a huge plus.\n\nAt one point someone in our group left a bag in one of the gondolas and the staff were eager to help us recover the lost articles and ensure we felt taken care of.\n\nWould definitely recommend a trip for anyone interested in a day or weekend on the slopes."

   "Was interesting, but definitely  more geared to/ fun/more to do for toddlers. We are one adult and a 12 and 10 year old. Was finished in about an hour, and that was pushing it. So almost  $50 bucks to all get in was way waaaaaaay over priced for what you get. Should be 5-6 bucks a person, absolute MAX...Not 14 and 17!  And that doesn't even give you full access.  :(\nYou Would  better off going out to a movie and all get snacks and drinks for that price.... and would  last longer.  \n\nThe more I think about how much I spent the more peeved I feel... as  this only occupied us for an hour.  at least it supports the animals they keep, who seem responsibly cared for.",
   "It's our local haunt. Present exhibit is butterflies. Very cool. Older kids are not going to find as much to do for repeat visits. But you've kids will love it again and again and again. Great place to go to get out in the winter. Break the cabin fever.",
   "Great aquarium and marine science center. There are exhibits that work for a good range of ages (including adults). They have a small movie theater as well as seasonal exhibits. We were able to see the butterflies this time. The membership applies to multiple places throughout the US.",
   "We visited this museum looking specifically for the butterfly seasonal exhibit and we got a lot more than we expected. Unbeknownst to me, this museum also has a specific focus on turtles as well, which are my wife's second favorite animal after butterflies(which she says are animals, don't blame me). What more is there to say about a museum? It was clean, informative, and fascinating with plenty of interactive exhibits to entertain even my adhd-addled brain. Certainly worth a visit if you find yourself able to make the trip",
   "Nice educational tour to understand the wildlife of Lake Champlain and surrounding area. We spent about 2.5 hours there and were entertained most of the time. We saw an Eel feeding and played with all the interactive exhibits. It was nice to see a wide variety of marine and reptile life up close.\nWe would recommend ECHO as a stop for anyone coming to Burlington for more than a day. See my funny face with a Muskie."

It is one of the best sunset parks in the area. Not as busy and crazy as waterfront park while still having similar amenities. The only feedback I have is that I wish they cleared/plowed the bike path that goes through it during the winter time. If its winter, walk at your own risk the path gets incredibly icy.",
   "One of my favorite parks. The Earth Clock has special meaning to my husband and I. We were engaged here. There is a small beach and trails around the area, and it's along the Burlington Bike.",
   "Oakledge Park is the ultimate getaway, especially in the summertime. There are plenty of things to do in the park, like play on the swings, use the tennis or shuffle ball courts, or relax by the water along the rocky cliffs and take a quick dip. The summer sunsets here are perfect and the cooking/eating areas are well-kept. The perfect spot for anyone visiting Burlington!"

   "Great outdoor adventure for kids and the family.  You enter and exit through the gift shop.  From there you head out on to trails with artwork and fun places to stop.  Along the way there are buildings that host presentations on wildlife.  Presenters are informative and fun - and kids like seeing wild life up close.  There are also areas where you can view birds and other animals.  There are bathrooms in buildings along the way.  Our favorite part is the canopy walk that goes up into the tops of trees.  The fencing had wire mesh over the boards, so I wasn't worried about my toddler going between slats.  \ud83d\ude0a A fun day visit.  But there is enough to do that you could come back at many points and find something new each time.",
   "We stopped here once in 2008 out of curiosity. Since then this is always one stop on our vacations. You will be in awe of not only the raptor but their staff is caring and full of info. Now every time we look to the sky we challenge each other on what type of raptor we are seeing. Please go bring the kids you won't be disappointed.",
   "VINS provides an amazing experience for everybody at all ages.... The staff is very professional, friendly,  and knowledgeable. The aerial walk is simply a structural wonder and so much fun!!!! The cause for rehabilitating birds who have been injured and releasing them back to the wild if possible (or providing a home to birds who otherwise cannot live in the wild on their own) is a very admirable one and they do an amazing job! We highly recommend this place and we will be back yet again.....",
   "Canopy sky walk is fantastic! I'm afraid of heights and I still loved it! The viewing area for the owls and raptors is wonderful as well and I can't wait to walk the trails next time. You can borrow snowshoes free of charge...great day out",
   "This organization does great work for ornithological preservation and history.  The overall atmosphere and energy is very friendly. Intelligent. Clean. Well organized. The new skywalk is wonderful. A must visit place when you're in the area."

   "Nice farm and history. The place has staff around that informed you of the history and we're dressed for the period. Well kept and clean, great for a family outing. If you grew up around farms maybe not so interesting. Plenty to see though, would recommend on a nice weather day.",
   "A walk back into Vermont history.  Displays how three successive families lived in the upper Connecticut River valley.  Tours conducted by the National Park Service so you can enjoy every detail of life lived over the past 200+years. Don't miss it.",
   "Really cool farm in the middle of nowhere really. Lots of cool animals. My son loves the animals and petting them. If you\u2019re around go here for sure.",
   "Although historically interesting with beautiful architecture, this is a wonderful place to just get outdoors.  There are lots of tree covered carriage roads and hiking paths that weave the property.  We hiked up to the Pogue, which is a beautiful pond, especially this time of year (fall) with the foliage peeking through.  \n\nParking is convenient and plentiful across the street.  There is no entrance fee to the park, but if touring the buildings, there is a charge.  Reservations are suggested for the house tours.\n\nThere are lots of activities everyday, so check online for the schedule ahead of time.",
   "This is a very cool national park, built on the idea of sustainable conservation. Definitely worth a visit!"

From the food and drinks to the service, it was beyond excellent. If I lived close I would be a regular here. \n\nPictured is the Smoke on the Water \ud83c\udf78, Bread Pudding, and Seared Beef.",
   "Fantastic little restaurant near the State Capital. They unlocked the door to let us wait inside as it was about 2 degrees outside and we were a little earlier than expected which was greatly appreciated! Staff is very friendly and seemed to know about three quarters of the guests that arrived on a saturday morning. Nice casual and almost homey atmosphere. Food was excellent I had the sausage and biscuits which was enough that I couldn't even finish the whole thing, had an interesting flavor to it as well that made it stand out in a good way! Will definitely go back here when I am in the area and in need of a delicious meal that is locally sourced and very filling.",
   "Brunch is excellent! They had such fun cocktails (like a ginger mimosa!), a variety menu and great service. It's a smaller restaurant, while we only had to wait maybe 20 minutes for a table at brunch I can imagine this place fills quick for dinner. I will definitely be back!",
   "Absolutely perfect food and wine list, in a lovely atmosphere with beautiful humans! I can't wait to go back. 10/10 will dine again!!",
   "Best Restaurant in Montpelier! Pork was exceptional, French onion pudding was great, fish was good, breakfast was exceptional. We went three times in our short stay! Go, enjoy, make reservations ahead of time though!"

   "HOLY SMOKES IS THIS PLACE EVER GOOD!\n\nPrices are very reasonable. $20 for one of their nicer meals and I promise you couldn't be more satisfied.\n\nGo get some delicious Italian food. You won't regret it. \nI'm from the coast of Maine and even I think the seafood here is absolutely delicious!",
   "If I had to judge this restaurant based on my last visit I probably would question myself on whether I would go back or not. I have been there three times before.  Twice for dinner with reservation, and my last time was for lunch. Both times for dinner were a great experience. I would recommend this place for dinner because it felt 100% different during the evening than it does in the daytime. My last visit was for lunch, we were sat on a table with the water view, our first 15 minutes after sitting down we were greeted once and barely payed attention to. The sun was beaming through the window so hard I couldn't see anything from the reflection off the table and silverware, I had to move seats and sit the opposite of my friend in order for us to not be blinded by the light. The soda I ordered was extremely flat it tasted like sugar water, when I told the waitress she got me a different soda and it still tasted the same. I was upset I even paid a couple dollars for that. The service at that time was very mediocre, the waitress wasn't very attentive or happy. The one thing that shocked me the most about this place and I'm not sure if it was the time of the day or because we were sitting by the window where we could see the silverware well, but they were not polished at all, in-fact they looked really gross and dirty. My friends spoon was very greasy as well. Overall I was not impressed with the cleanliness and the service that was received on my last visit, it changed how I feel about this restaraunt. The food was very tasty though every single time I have been there and I would still recommend this place for a nice evening time dinner.",
   "Very good , very Italian food, very helpful service. Could use a few more vegan options but they've adaptable. We love it!  Not inexpensive but no more than any truly good VT restaurant. One of my favorites!",
   "First, I was amazed at their gluten free sections, WOW!  My daughter has Celiac and going out to eat can be a bit scary, especially Italian food.  \n\nThe food was delicious!  The portions were perfect and the staff was outstanding.  I really can't think of a single thing that was fantastic about this place.",
   "Solid choice with great menu options from salads, to pastas and pizza.  The mussels with tomato broth were excellent.  The Apple salad and Caesar were the perfect size for dinner."

   "Visited The Blue Stone for my first time tonight. Went with my wife and brother. A very nice atmosphere. The smaller dining area makes way for a comfortable and less crowded and noisy atmosphere of other local restaurants. Steph, our server, was very courteous! Always had a welcoming smile and was super attentive. It was only when we were leaving that we learned she was serving alone. Didn't notice, she was such a delight!!! Didn't come across stressed or overwhelmed once (I hope her manager reads this). The menu selection was huge! Lots of unique delicious choices. Will be frequenting this spot as one of our new favorites for sure!",
   "Cozy pizza shop with a great street view. Seating is limited, but the pizza is delicious. We got the 10 inch namesake plus two sodas for $20, or you can also get a deal for $8.50 with two big slices and a soda. The bartender was friendly and attentive. Highly recommend!",

   "The food hit the spot! The pho in particular was perfect on the cold day of our visit. Service was friendly and reasonably speedy. The only issue was there was no customer service staff when we arrived so we didn't know if we could just grab a table or wait to be seated. We stood for about 5 minutes before someone emerged from the kitchen. A sign at the entrance would have been nice.",
   "My husband and I have eaten great Vietnamese food in many parts of the world and we both would rank this restaurant very high. Not only is it very reasonable in its prices but the food is delicious. We ordered the lemongrass stir fry and the spring rolls and both were outstanding. We will come back again for sure. Also, the service was great and our waiter was so friendly and efficient..",

   "The food is delicious.  I had the seaweed soup which was pretty good, although I personally like the tom yum better.  As for my entr\u00e8e, that was absolutely amazing.  Perfect level of spice, fresh and crisp veggies, the egg noodles had a perfect texture, and the chicken was of better than average quality.  \n\nThe service was where this place lacks a bit.  It was slow and there appeared to only be one waitress and one bartender, but several tables full of customers (so we figured the food must be good).  I personally work in the service industry and it seemed that this place may be a little understaffed, but the food was worth the wait and they definitely make sure it's done right before it gets sent out.\n\nI know how it gets in the industry, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and still left a decent tip.  I will be back and I will be recommending this place to my friends!",

Cubano sandwich was fantastic! On house made bread. Everyone enjoyed their food, maybe slightly more for the wait, hunger being the best spice. No parking... local clue; park behind city hall and fire department ;) Easily visible from the street. I'd give 3.5 stars if possible... not quite 4. Not super keen on the dog in the restaurant. Pretty  sure that's not cool with code... Overall, the nonchalant attitude, rough presentation, and delicious eats make a reasonably authentic experience. Worth a visit for sure, just don't go if you're already hangry.",
   "Loved it. Tasty tacos and fair in downtown Montpelier with a certain local feeling of deliberate attention to food prep. Deliberately devoid of fanciness but full of elbow to shoulder taco fans patiently waiting their turn to pay and enjoy. Follow the locals to this favorite destination for a New England serving of grub and beer you won't regret.",

   "This is an excellent place to get tacos in Montpelier. They have a wide selection of beer, including Heady Topper and Focal Banger from the Alchemist Brewery. They also have an assortment of about half a dozen hot sauces that are rated on a 1-10 scale. My favorite are the Kimchi Tacos with the Shallow Days hot sauce.",

The whole restaurant has a beautiful layout and the tables are made to seat large parties. We had a group of 9 and the environments allows for great conversations. The staff was wonderful! I had the wagu and shrimp special and it was so good! Finished the meal off with a brownie sundae and an expresso. This is by far one of my favorite steak houses!",

The steaks were of course amazing, cooked perfectly. My rare was rare. \n\nAnd because it was our anniversary, they gave us a beautiful desert which was absolutely delicious.",

We even say not to worry about changing into a plate we will just eat it direct from the container..... he was so extremely rude ..... we couldn\u2019t stand his rudeness, so we decided to leave.\n\nWE WILL NEVER EVER ORDER IN THAT RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN! \nTHE FOOD IN NOT EVEN THAT GOOD.",

   "Good food and service. Live music and beer too! Bagels could be chewier. Super confusing choice to serve bagels, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, and Indian food- maybe a more focused offering would be more successful? The restaurant is up for sale for $66k all in if you're interested. See attached pictures for full menu",
   "The beauty of this place is the openness to other languages and musical traditions. Live traditional music from Ireland or Italy are some of the events that are presented. Perhaps a bit of cleanliness would make the place better. Also, there are crates at the entrance offering books for exchange. They only had newspapers. I just had a cup of tea at this place whose forte are bagels...",
   "This place was really cool. I walked in on an early morning for a bagel and there was a folk violin group jamming out. Bought a bag of cinnamon bagel chips too. They were fairly good. The bagel itself(everything) was ultra fresh and good.",
   "Great niche place with a relaxing vibe and interesting concept (bagels and burritos). Friendly staff and tasty burritos.",
   "Very good bagels and cream cheese! Awesome coffee too. I love this place."

If you have a party bigger than 4, expect to wait. Few tables for big parties. All in all, a great place!",

   "You're safe if you stick with burgers or soup, easy items. I am sorry I ordered scallops. They were in a dish full of hot butter, no taste and rubbery. The coleslaw or whatever it was was swimming in bottled Italian dressing. The rolls were good. Will order something safer if I ever get stuck there again. Cannot believe how packed the place was, and always is. Shows how few good restaurants there are in that area."

The food is delicious, and the coffee and hot chocolate are incredible as well. Not only is everything delicious, it is consistently good. Some restaurants around here are very hit or miss, but we have never had a bad visit here. I can always trust I'll get a good meal when I come here. The owner is incredibly sweet as well. She is so kind and always smiling, and she gets to know her regular customers. Love this place! Check it out.",

   "Excellent addition to the Montpelier dining scene! The falafel small plate was spectacular and the dynamite mushrooms very good.  We also enjoyed two of the gyros; great pita and everything tasted so fresh! Friendly service and good prices. Highly recommend!",
   "Stopped here for a quick takeout lunch and WOW! Super friendly service, and it was the best falafel sandwich I've had in VT! \nThey know what they're doing."

They had many on tap but I would of liked to see more local beers or even more house made brews",

In the meantime he ordered another drink,it never came!! Finally he got his steak and I asked about his beer,and she finally got it.  Desert.. I paid for..not one thing was comp.  Definitely not happy .. always bragged about J. Morgan's..not sure if I will again. As my family goes there for Easter and mother's day!! Really disappointed.. it was a special occasion ( my birthday) .\n Waitress was great, tipped her over 20 percent,as it wasn't her fault!!\ud83d\ude2d",
   "Good food but definitely not the J Morgans of old. Service was slow, Bread is now a menu item ($3), Salad is extra (even with a $46 steak), Menu is paired down compared to what it used to be and the seafood selection leaves something to be desired. Too bad really, our family, kids included, used to look forward to a nice dinner together here. Time to find a new spot I guess.  I will qualify that the food is still good but everything else has really changed for the worse.",

We would've stayed longer but the political vibe of the band Umlaut was very off putting and put a dent into our enjoyment.. If we want to go to a politically themed rally we could have done so elsewhere. But we came to enjoy ourselves to good music and we're looking forward to the drag show that was planned that night. Unfortunate that we felt the need to leave before the show.. We will be back another time for sure. We did meet Melissa, nice owner, she's got a good gig there...played a round of billiard as well.",

They have a sea shanty sing along night, live band karaoke on another night, other live bands, food deals, and enough drink variety for a small place.

The crepe was cold, and the spinach was raw.  It should have been wilted.  And the salad was sparse, like three small leaves of lettuce.   I remember the salad while not large could be considered more than garnish and the crepes were warm and delicious.   Next time I am in town, I will go somewhere else."

Someone could have atleast told us sorry for the wait or stopped us while we left. It would take a lot of me to come back to this place. How unfortunate! I'm very upset! Ruined Valentine's Day! :(",
   "Delicious. Fresh sushi.. Best I've had in a while. We went for a Christmas work dinner and it was great! Nice area in the back for parties and waitress was friendly.",
   "Sushi are nice, sashimi are not super fresh it's more frozen fish, but some like salmon was fresh. But overall food was good and atmosphere too"

   "My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. We had the spinach and artichoke dip and burgers with fries. The food was hot and delicious.  Our waitress was very polite. We had a great lunch with a wonderful atmosphere.  It is worth the drive to this beautiful restaurant.",
   "If a fancy Italian restaurant and a greasy pizza joint made love and had a baby, this would be it. I mean that in the best of ways.  We had the garlic bombs which were great and the marinara sauce that came with them was phenomenal, however they served us 7 of them. This type of thing bothers me so much because there's always one extra and it creates this awkward social situation at the table. Just give us 6 or 8.  Pizza was good, very traditional Italian inspired flavors and the dough was very good. Nothing to write home about but it was a good meal. It should be said that the atmosphere was awesome, really nice decor and the whole firehouse history is pretty cool.",
   "Went here with a party of 9 last time. Not one complaint from the table. In fact I have been here several times with no complaints. The menu has everything you could imagine on it. The only problem I ever have when I go is what do I get this time?",
   "Great fare at even better prices. The attractive woman who owns the place is so sweet and very gracious. I highly recommend trying this place!",
   "Absolutely a must see for the firefighter. Ladder 1 grill is the best restaurant around, amazing food. Completely amazing how they turned a old fire station into a grill that has different items on the menu from firefighter around the area. Tons of firefighter pictures and tee shirts and more on display."

   "First time going there tonight. It was delicious. The owner/one of the cooks (not sure which roll he had) came out and explained what the different dinners and specials were. All sounded good. And the one I picked was pretty darn amazing. Everyone who worked there were very pleasant!",
   "Always delicious ramen. My go-to is the Spicy Korean Ramen and it is wonderful. Flavorful, fills you up, and fresh. The Singapore Curry Ramen is also good- typical a special on weekends. This restaurant adds great cuisine variety to Barre. Go support them!",
   "This restaurant beats expectations and is a great place to stop. To my knowledge there isn't much like this around Barre, and I hope that works to their advantage. It's a small restaurant with not much seating, but it's worth stepping into. The owners are very friendly and willing to accommodate for vegan diets and allergens. They make you feel welcome and promote a great dining experience. If you're looking for a good bowl of ramen try this place and you're sure to like it.",
   "Beautiful presentation, absolutely delicious food. I will definitely be eating here again.",
   "Food is pretty good but service and hospitality is phenomenal. They are a family business run by a bunch of super nice guys. Offer you extra bowl with tonkatsu broth for sharing ramen, extra hot teas, and even free steamed dumplings as they cooked extra."

   "If you happen to get your order right, congrats to you.  Simple order..substitute lettuce for onions on my gyro!  \" oh I'm sorry sir, I'll try to do better next time\"  well how does that make up for this time? \"Well I could give you a couple dollars off your next order\"  how about you give me my meal next time? \"Well I cant do that without asking a manager\" \n\nSo like really, i need to tell you to talk to your manager to give me what I just asked for?  So I'll just post this for all to see!  I simply wanted lettuce instead of onions!  Oh!!!  And this is not medium cooked!!!!   Looks like it's time to get people who know the menu, And people that know how to cook!!!\n\nUpdate:\nRecalled after an unsuccessful first attempt wanting to speak directly to manager or owner.  Was able to do so and made the situation whole!  Thank you.",
   "Good food. One of the few options for delivery in the area. Usually comes within half hr/45 mins. The Calzones are so big it\u2019s like folding a large pizza in half over itself. The portions on a lot of items will leave you with some midnight snack leftovers. Definitely recommend giving this place a try!!",
   "My family loves Basil's, we used to go to Vespas in Essex, but now they have been surpassed by the Basil's! Wooh!",
   "I love their food. they do pizza right. I had a great lunch. great staff.",
   "Good food, delivers, local, friendly staff"

   "Arrived before a Sunday dinner \"rush\" and was met by welcoming staff. The menu was apparently new and the waitress couldn't answer a couple of questions about it but it wasn't a huge deal. What threw me off was the number of times a waitress went by and none of the cups on my table were getting refills. Flagging someone down for a water refill isn't common but I attribute that to a fairly young or new staff.\n\nThe food was exactly what I wanted! Crunchy tacos and burritos made to order. The tacos are surprisingly expensive. Three crunchy tacos are basically the same price as a fully loaded burrito that has five times the amount of food inside. The chocolate toffee mouse cake was delicious - but had a negligible amount of toffee.",
   "Nice Mexican restaurant in a small town which surprised me. The food was great & the staff were pleasant. I would definitely go back if ever in the area again.",
   "Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the tamale fritters. Big thanks to Nile for suggesting the summertime white sangria. Street tacos were perfect for lunch.",
   "I\u2019ve only been to Julio\u2019s a handful of times, but every time has been a great experience! They play fun music, their food and margaritas are delicious, and I\u2019m super impressed by their customer service!! I had Tabitha as a waitress tonight, and she is so attentive and fun. Highly recommend for amazing salsa and a fun night out!",
   "Tasty food at a great price and a good selection!"

   "This was without doubt the worst Chinese food I've ever had. In fact it was kind of impressive. I would recommend to lower your standards and humble yourself.",
   "Always a fabulous experience!",
   "Great service and even better food. A nice quiet atmosphere. You got the fish tanks to look at also.",
   "Went on a weekend evening. Place was not that crowded but the buffet was virtually empty of food. New food would come out of the kitchen but at an extremely slow pace and in small batches. Honestly,  everything tasted off.  Final straw was having to wait for clean ice cream bowls for the kids. When they finally arrived, the ice cream machine was empty.  Feels like they are really struggling and cutting any and all corners to stay open.",
   "Great food and service."
