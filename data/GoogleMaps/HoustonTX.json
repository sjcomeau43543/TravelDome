  "Good burgers. They have a nice spice flavor to them. The buns and fries were great too. We enjoyed our visit :)",
  "Great service. The Rancor burger was cooked perfectly, the caramelized onions were excellent, bacon crisp but not burnt. The Chicken Biryani has a great flavor that you wouldn't expect from fast casual. The seasoned fries are a must.",
  "Very tasty food. Got the double burger ( can\u2019t remember the official name on the menu) but it was amazing. Beef was cooked to perfection and the seasoned fries were just as good. Slightly on the pricier side, just a heads up!",
  "Nice place and clean. Good service and smiling  faces.\nThe BURGER was hot & delicious. It taste like a kabob. My family liked it very much.",
  "Terrible experience. I heard a lot about this place. Had my expectations held up and crashed into pieces.  \n  Burger is just meh. Buns weren't even toasted. Come on now! The sauce that makes the difference, but honestly there's ways more better places. \n Got the philly fries, big mistake.  All soft and soggy. And there was no chili, just a few chunks of beef patty \ud83d\ude44 and really little on the sauce.  That was $9?! And for goodness,  $1 for extra sauces! Ridiculous! \n  The wings were just fried chicken and poured flavored sauce on it. Ordered a chicken taco, the lady said: \"No, too spicy!\" I mean, I I guess..\n  Overall, \u270b\ud83d\udeab"

We were the third customer in a hall that could probably seat and couple hundred people. The  food was horrible. The dahi-baday tasted as if made in lemon. The fish was ok but the somosa was petrified. Burnt and hard rock. The filling had a weird smell. All the eateries in the surrounding area had a waiting and after we ate here it was obvious why this place was deserted. Bad bad management.",

Of late, I am seeing his brother taking charge, and it has been downhill since then. Recently I ordered bhel, they just mixed dry ingredients and gave it. No veggies, no spicy/sweet sauce, nothing (see photo). Hope Nirmanz will take control of his restaurant again. Else, another Indian restaurant bites dust.",

What it came and what we ate was like Goat tomato.. a tomato curry with 4 to 5 pieces of goat meat.. quantity was also not much and surely it's not worth a price. I didn't dare to order anything else but left half of our food there and went somewhere else...   Guys, work on the price,quantity and quality as well..  If this kind of food is continued then it wont take long for people to change their preferences for restaurant... Good luck.. Definitely, not going back.",

Multi spice levels offered. Samples are even given, if you ask. We will be returning again for sure - many things to check off the menu :)",

  "Great food, service and decor. While visiting family we had to do the Friday lunch at Perry's. The food is always superb and the service is terrific too. \nEveryone went with the pork chop. It's a huge and flavorful double cut that will be enough for lunch and dinner. \nPlenty of other steakhouse choices too.",
  "We had reservations and were seated fairly quickly in a nice little room off of the busy main dining area. It was quieter and we could easily converse. \n\nWe chose Friday lunch for their famous pork chop that is offered in a lunch portion on Fridays only. The smaller version of their 7-finger (high) roasted pork chop is served with mashed potatoes and house-made applesauce. \n\nMy husband ordered that with creamed spinach and I ordered the salmon, served with mashed potatoes and assorted vegetables. \n\nI helped him a bit as my salmon was no way near his generous serving. The chop had a very delicious glaze and was tender, though not as tender as it was on our last visit. My salmon was cooked just the way I ordered it, medium with a touch of pink. My vegetables were crisp and plentiful.\n\nThis is a lovely location and the server was attentive and friendly. I asked the front desk attendant for a favour and she cheerfully accommodated me with no hesitation. \n\nWe don't come often and feel gently pampered when we do!",
  "We were in the area to see the Illusionists at the Smart Financial Center and wanted a special dinner. We made a 6pm reservation online, valet parked and were sat immediately on arrival. We soon realized after we were sat and ordered drinks and an appetizer that the show was at 7pm and not 8pm so we promptly let our server know and placed our order. She was very accommodating and put a rush on everything. Food and service was amazing, only wish we would have had more time to enjoy the experience. We did make it to the show  with a minute to spare.",

I think the waiter forgot to put in one of the appetizer orders and then one of our entrees was also 15 minutes later then the rest. They are always super busy so I don't believe it was the new year Eve rush.  Overall it took us over two hours to get out of there. Never again.",

Yesterday I ordered macaroons and before I could head that way I had a call from the Manager saying they were out of those but could pick something else. Once we got there they let us pick out any 4 pastries since we had already paid in the app. Great attitude and great customer service!! Thank you Jennifer and team!!",
  "This is the worst Panera location. This is my sixth complaint at this location. They have forgot meat in my bowl twice, forgot avocado, added cheese when I said no cheese, no side, and the portions are HORRIBLE!  The worst customer service by far was the manager on duty. He upset me even further by stating they have to measure out all food when i showed him the bowl was practically empty he said other cooks didn\u2019t measure. Every time I visit a different location I have a positive experience and good portions. This one gives child\u2019s size portions with terrible customer service. I wish I would have taken a picture for $11??? I will never ever spend another penny at this location! Even though it\u2019s blocks from my home. Oh forgot to mention it takes forever to order in line no matter what time you go."

Many of the 'burger joints' one goes to have gotten the burger down to a fast science, but here, every sandwich is raised to a high art.\nAll ingredients were prepared in-house, including the grinding of the Angus beef for the burger patty and the slicing of the cheese.\nI was surprised to find that they even bake their own buns in-house daily.\nI shall be back to sample many more of the"

Guy behind the counter was having a very loud conversation with a guy in the kitchen area about how many hours they were getting between two locations.  He took my order and went right back to their discussion.  Food came out pretty quick but when I got home I found that the rice was too dry to eat. The chicken was dry with very little sauce and the broccoli tasted like it had fish oil  on it.  Even the fortune cookies were stale. Should have just thrown that $10 in the trash...  so sad another good place down the toilet......looks like I should have read the reviews before stopping in.",
  "Before I get into my review, I want to preface it by saying that I really love PeiWei. That said, this location has gotten oddly bad over the last several visits. This time was the worst, and I have to say it appears to be all about the staff. The young woman that took our order had the attitude that she'd rather be any place else. Out order was messed up (as were the orders of several other customers in the short time we were there.) The place was just dirty. The floors were sticky and most of the tables were dirty. The staff would come and clear the table, but never wiped them down. The area where the tea and fountain drinks are was a mess. The entire place just felt dirty and unkempt. When the food came it was just not the same experience we are used to. My daughters order was just wrong. Mine was a pile of rice and a little bit of beef, and the Kung Pao chicken in my wife's bento box was unbelievably salty...all of which are unusual for the restaurant. I sincerely hope someone from corporate sees this review and pays this location a visit.",

Also we got carbonara and basil pesto pasta \ud83c\udf5d \nIt\u2019s nice environment and is a good one so I recon you to come here and enjoy it as well!\nCheers \ud83e\udd42",
  "This is what I call a fast food Italian pasta place. I'm a huge pasta-lover. The environment is very casual and allows for small talk. The lines clear up quickly. You could build your own pasta and have no limits for toppings. The regular sized bowl is pictured...which could easily make for two meals (which you would feel full both times). I have never tried their drinks, but their water tastes clean and very refreshing. The only downside may be the extra meats that you could add are a little overly salty and have lack of special taste. I used to love their grass-fed meatballs...I'm not sure why they changed it up to be not so tasty.",
  "The place I wanted to go was closed, when we accidentally stumbled upon this place. It was Italian so I did not think anything could go wrong. And I was right. The food was absolutely delicious. We dined inside. The benches were a little uncomfortable after sitting for so long oh, but the food was worth it. They had three different options of how you pick at your food prepared and I recommend there lemonade versus the one from the fountain drink. I recommend anyone looking for good food and good customer service to try Piada Italian Street Food.",
  "I like the concept of fast casual Italian. It was really easy for our group to order and get our food. The portion sizes were ok and overall it's a good deal. The biggest downside was the service. Not a single employee was friendly or welcoming.",

  "It is a delight to take the family to AGU Ramen. The food is delicious and of good size. The staff is really friendly and attentive.",
  "Service was awesome at this Ramen location located in the heart of Sugar Land's City Walk area. Waiters were very friendly and willing to guide us through the different culinary options available. Food was great but there were certain bites where the temperature was off. Almost like it had been heated up and hadn't done so throughout. It was tasty but the temperature difference kinda threw it off. Definitely worth the visit, on the fence about a return though. If you're in the area, it's worth checking out.",
  "Great soup, not salty, the noodle is very chewy, not to soft. Garage next to the restaurant, easy to access. Strongly recommended!",
  "I had high hopes that this could be a regular Sugar Land stop. After reading mixed reviews, decided to give it a try. My husband ordered a couple of appetizers and I went straight for the spicy ramen! He liked his food well enough. My ramen had nice enough heat at #2, but the house-made Thai chili sauce seemed a bit oily. The broth flavor was quite nice. The noodles were not my favorite. The cha-siu was over-cooked and looked dry. When I bite into it, it should hold its shape, not fall apart. The egg had good flavor, but it was firmer than I'm used to eating. The server was very attentive and friendly. Don't know if we'll be back for a second try.",
  "Pretty good Ramen... One of the best in Sugar Land. Would have have it five stars but service was slow, the workers seemed not very concerned and not timely. Nothing crazy... Just not what I expect. Either way, will be back if I'm in the area and want ramen."

  "Ordered Tosilog breakfast plate, was more than enough food and very delicious. \nLeft full and pleased. Will be back for breakfast again",
  "Cute little restaurant. simple delicious items that reminds me so much of what my mom used to cook even though we are Vietnamese. the little sour soup had no veggies floating but was awesome and at the perfect temperature for me to consume right away. the sausage was sweet and juicy and very tasty. the chicken was delicious. as for their gulaman drink if you like tapioca drinks, you probably gonna love this Filipino version. it was all clean and there was no music, which is a pleasant change from what i'm used to.",
  "So happy I found this place. I am constantly craving Filipino food during my 12-13 hr shifts and this place is so close to work. Great people, great food and great prices. :)",
  "Food was delicious, but the selection was not too great at 4pm on a Sunday even though the restaurant was open for another 6 hours. There were no egg rolls and not a single pancit diah. There is hia left me a bit puzzled. There  were several meat dishes but none of the delicious vegetable dishes you'd normally find at a turo turo. I'd have given them 5 stars for a better selection.",
  "We used to come here often when craving Filipino food. If they go back to serving hot meals like before, it will once again be very enjoyable to eat here as their style of cooking is very good, almost like delicious home-cooked meals. (I dislike having to eat Bangus that is not hot - eating hot Bangsilog is part of the fun.) I think the all-day breakfast combination deals where you get to choose from about 10 dishes is a really good set up. I love their Tortang Talong (Filipino Eggplant Omelet) and Dinuguan. They also have excellent Turon (Banana Eggroll). And Goldilocks products are available here. Please be better again."

  "The crust was cooked perfectly. The toppings were a little scant but fresh and tasty. Love the balsamic glaze on top. I love the blood orange lemonade. Service was good. Wish there were plates to share your pizza with. The patio overlooks a very pretty view with a lake and ducks and turtles.",
  "I wish I could leave zero stars. I ordered a pizza from here and they charged my card, but by the time I got there ten minutes later, they said they were closed. I have been fighting them for 2 weeks trying to get a refund for food I never got. Go to Pepperoni's or Pizza 101 instead for better service and they will definitely not steal from you like Blaze Pizza stole from me.\n\n*update* I'll change my review to 2 stars because I FINALLY got not a refund, but at least a pizza out of them after fighting for 2 weeks. I will definitely never come here again though after the customer service nightmare.",
  "They serve customized hot krispy pizzas with lots of choices of meat and vegetables available. There are many seats available outside by a stream with many ducks floating around. It's a nice restaurant with good scenery, and I'll be back again shortly...",
  "I love food & currently I have been on a plant based diet, this is my perfect cheat meal. Cauliflower crust, vegan cheese, all the veggies I want! Delicious \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b edit* they are out of Cauliflower & Keto crust till March but still advertise it! I waited in line for 20 minutes to hear this",
  "Great service and staff.  We asked for high rise and didnt give us high rise dough when they were putting the veggies on and corrected it.  They gave us our whole meal free to our surprise.  Food was fresh tasting and hot."

  "Enjoyed our visit to Bar Louis, with one exception. The bartender was convivial and knowledgeable, making great cocktails with good service without being pestering. I quite enjoyed my Manhattan(s).  The exception to the great experience was the presence of persistent fruit flies. I know they are difficult to eradicate, but they were annoying.",

  "My wife brought me here for a celebratory brunch. The location is perfect as it is situated in a serene, mall with lots of attractions left, right and center.\nThe wait time is long but they have a neat system which basically allows you get on the queue remotely. It tracks your progression through the queue and notifies you when you\u2019re up.\nThe service was prompt. We received our food within minutes of placing our orders. We ordered the Southern Belle. It was delicious.\nThe only drawback for me is that the portions looked little small to me (especially the sweet potato fries).\nOverall though, I would highly recommend this spot.",
  "This place is simply delicious. Every-single-thing I've tried I've loved, simple as that. Although the \"Angry Rooster\" pizza is still my favorite, I keep trying new stuff every time we go there.They have so many and so different really good tasting food to choose from. The place is nice and clean, the atmosphere is super friendly, relaxed and cozy. You always have a nice view of the square. The service is great and doesn't take forever to get your meal as on other pizza shacks around town. And if you think it's costly, you'll be surprised. The place is not that big, so I recommend you get in the waiting list online so you don't wait at all when you arrive. Been a regular there and will be for much much longer.",
  "Absolutely amazing food. Great for comfort brunch and drinks. They gave a selection if comfort food, breakfast, and pizza. Make sure you try the waffles! They serve an impressive selection of beers and great mimosas.\n\nThe staff is great and friendly. The atmosphere is casual and trendy. There restaurant is clean. There are outside seating options available. It's located in front of town hall, to the right of the grassy area. \n\nThe ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars is due to the wait to get in. I've been here a few times and there's often a wait, especially weekends before 2. Obviously worth the wait because I keep going back.",
  "First, the menu is just really fun to read over: great titles, descriptions, and more. Second, the food was fantastic! Fluffy waffles, syrup and honey, breakfast food you will wish you could have everyday and any day. Third, even what they use to bring a check out was unique! It arrives in paperback book. \ud83e\udd23 Definitely planning to go back!",
  "Must come visit for lunch! Lunch menu is very reasonable and offers a wide variety of plates that work well to share among friends. All food was delicious and fresh. Excellent place to relax with family and friends and even let the kids run around outside while adults enjoy the meal and a few drinks. Highly recommend this place."

They were so thoughtful that they even brought samplers for the kids too! Their kids menu has lots of options and my kids loved the food. Their fried calamari was a super hit with my kids too. I took the fish taco and it had a nice twist in the flavor. I loved the ambience and my kids also enjoyed the place. Will certainly go back again!",

It is the best I have had outside of New Orleans. The grilled shrimp is also very good. If you enjoy non-pretentious seafood at a reasonable price this place is for you. Very, very good.",
  "This restaurant was casual and welcoming which I actually liked. And I enjoyed the peach mule and hurricane cocktails which were both good and well made.

This is now one of my favorite places. Our server, Jenny, was super attentive and patient. I'll ask for her again. Randall checked on us several times and was a joy to talk to.

Joya is usually our server as we typically visit on the same night each week and she is always fantastic, serving with a smile! \n\nOne particular evening the croissants were all out and after checking in the back for some she came out and told us there weren't anymore and it would be about 20 minutes before a new batch was ready. With that, we decided not to have croissants that night. Well, as we were nearing the end of our salads, here comes Joya with fresh hot croissants just for us. She said, \"I know you said you didn't want them tonight but I wanted to bring them out to you anyway since they were ready before you finished.\" She was so sweet and thoughtful to bring them out to us! :-)",

They didn\u2019t charge me for something they didn\u2019t give me, so that\u2019s fine I suppose, but I would have loved what I asked for.",

The French Toast was really good, as we divided it up just so everyone could get a taste. On top of that they had warm syrup! \ud83d\ude0a I ordered the West Coast Arnold which was a recommendation from my younger brother and I must say it was a GREAT decision! The poached egg was perfect with the generous size bacon slices. We also had a few shots and mimosas to start the morning which were both really good. I think we actually had pineapple mimosas. Prices are definitely high, not a bargain place but the food was exactly what I wanted. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

  "Cute place with tasty food and friendly service! A friend and I spent a couple hours here during breakfast. Our server was nice and polite, keeping my coffee filled and offering suggestions on breakfast starters. We ordered the vegetable scrambled eggs and the Golden Gate omelette. Both of these places came with fruit, a biscuit and this hash brown thing (or grits). Portions were good! I was able to take half my omelette to-go! I would definitely come back to try their waffles or French toast. Also free parking in the parking garage not too far from the restaurant. Quick service, clean restaurant.",
  "It was fairly busy when we arrived at about 10am on a Saturday. However, our wait was under 15 minutes. I noticed that the place looked clean, bright and family friendly. I started off with a good and refreshing mimosa followed by a delicious Philly scramble with perfectly seasoned slices of prime rib and sauteed mushrooms. The side biscuit had a nice outside crunch, and was soft and warm on the inside. Also, the hashbrown casserole was creamy and delicious. I must add that our server, Stephanie, was amazing which enhanced our overall experience.",

Our servers were David, Angie, and Laura. Our order came out correct, hot, and prompt. I appreciate all you checking in on us to make sure everything was ok. We will definitely be back. The food was delicious. They also have BIG texas size pancakes. Our visit exceeded all of our expectations\ud83d\udc95 P.s. Once we were served the whole table went quiet and smiles came out!

  "My wife and I chose the Sweet Boutique as the baker of our wedding cake (02/02/2020) after a disaster between us and other original baker. They were kind and patient and help us out in a bind since we were running out of time before our wedding. However, they pulled off an exquisite geod cake that we always wanted and it was clear we should have chosen them from the start. The cake layers and sheet cake were moist and held up very nicely. Their coconut cake and passion fruit filling was to die for, lemon cake and strawberry filling was the perfect amount of tart and sweet, chocolate cake and ganche was a perfect combo, and almond cake and amaretto was so much better than we could have anticipated. Everything was perfect and we cannot thank Christine, Martin, and their team enough for making it all work for us. It is simply unbelievable that she was self-taught and can't wait to see her compete in the Spring Baking show on the Food Network.",
  "I absolutely love all their cakes! I got my wedding cake here and have lloved their variety ever since! I get all my cakes from here! Every time we do a family party or special event we know where the cakes will be from! I especially love that they are light and fluffy and just the right amount of sweet! I took these two cakes two hours away to a town called Palacios and they always arrive perfect which is always amazing to me. Just love love love this bakery!",
  "After seeing these on Insta, I had to try them! I don't like donuts but I sure love mochi. \n\n1/2 Dozen Mochi Donuts $20\n\nMochi Donut Flavors: Matcha, Blueberry, Strawberry, Nutella, Mango Cream, Pistachio Rose\n\nMy intial reactions after one bite each:\n\nstrawberry - frosting was too sweet but yumm, chewy texture\n\nbluberry - pretty good, mochi custard, yummy, will get this again\n\nmatcha - Mmm chocolate base and very deep matcha flavor, so gooood!! must try\n\nmango cream - wow the mango cream on top is really mangomango, tastes so delicious\n\nnutella- chocolate nutella taste, nothing special, not really chewy either\n\nrose pistachio - rose taste, kinda bland, looks cute though\n\nI was lucky because today they had on the same day pickup, I ordered at 10am and was able to pick up at 11am! Located in Sugarland Town Square, a lot of parking spaces. \n\nWhen the weather is hot outside, 80F, on the way back home (ex 20min drive) the cream on top might melt and be sticky. \n\nI liked how these are not too thick and thin, perfect sized. Would I get this again? probably like a gift for friends :) It's super cute and if I do go again I want to try other flavors. Overall I think my drive was pretty worth it!",
  "I pretty much get cupcakes and cake pops once a  week lol. Always fresh never dry! Red velvet and tiramisu has to be my favorites hands down. Definitely my go-to spot in Sugarland.",
  "I came in for dessert after dining nearby, and I got a cupcake to go, in the hopes that I could sneakily eat on the way home out of the grasp of my toddler monster's tiny arms in the backseat. \n\nI open the box in the car to find a Chinese finger trap, designed to keep the cupcake secure enough to send through the mail. I needed both hands to free the treat, much to my dismay, as I'd intended on using at least one hand to drive. \n\nI'm a lady. One way around this overwhelming dilemma would be to do the unthinkable and go icing first. You just don't go icing first. Eventually I won against the overpriced sugar bomb and stuffed it into my mouth, as a lady would. \n\nFour stars."

  "My family went to this location to celebrate a birthday and it was a very disappointing experience. We were a party of 12 and were sat at two different tables because supposedly it was going to be so busy and we would be taking up too much room to put the tables together. We ordered drinks and appetizers which came out in a decent amount of time. Once we ordered our entrees, that's when things kind of fell apart. There were such long periods of time were our waiter didn't come to refill drinks. Once our entrees finally arrived, one of them was cool to the touch and we were told it was because they were trying to time them to come out together, but we were still missing an entree that didn't come out for another 20 min. After such a long time of no refills, two of our party took some of our glasses up to the bar themselves to get refills. The waiter never acknowledged the drinks again after that. Every part of this experience took way longer than it should have. We were there for 3 hours. Oh, and they never sat anyone else in the section where we were told we would have taken up too much room. It was empty the whole time we were there. After all of this, the waiter had the arrogance to tell me if I had any questions about tipping, the suggested tip amounts were at the bottom of the bill, and repeated his name in case we wanted to ask for him again. This makes sense if your customers are having a great experience, but it was pretty obvious that none of us were. So I'm not sure if he was being sincere or ironic. Either way, I will not be returning to this location or recommend it to others.",
  "Starting with the servers. The one that took our order was so energetic and had a good vibe. He even tried to make a drink that wasn\u2019t even in the menu (it came out good). The food came out super quick. But man, the food was so flavorful! At the end of our visit, he treated our table with anything we needed like boxes or drinks to go. I would definitely come back!",
  "Had a burger, fries and a glass of wine here at the bar on NYE while solo after a comedy show nearby.  It was very tasty.  Stephan waited on me.  Very attentive and we toasted on midnight.  Staff person made Hennessy cupcakes which were delicious and appreciated!",
  "We had our company gathering at this location and everyone had a great time. The food was served buffet style. Everything was delicious. Not one complaint! Servers went above and beyond to ensure everyone was satisfied and happy. Would definitely recommend this location for a company outing!",
  "Food was pretty average. They have a wide selection of beers. Their pizookie dessert is really good. It's a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with a few scoops of ice cream."

  "My visit was worth a positive review because of the remarkable service we received. We had arrived a few minutes before happy hour would end. And because our server came by quickly, we were able to put in orders for drinks and appetizers. I really enjoyed the Mexican martini which just seemed to have been perfectly made. The stuffed shrimp rouxpour was delicious as well. Everyone at the table had positive feedback about their meals and service.",

He brought to my attention a possible food allergy reaction in which he rectified promptly.  With that said, spoke volumes about this restaurant.  Marlin, thank you!!",

  "I've been here many times over the last 10ish years and it's exactly what you'd expect from a British-style pub. I think the food is above average and the drinks are priced well. There are a good selection of pub games. What sets baker Street apart for me is the generous specials and variety of seating. Great crowd almost all the time",
  "It's a pretty cool place too meet up with friends. They have multiple TVs if you are trying to watch the game. The main focus is more or less the bar. They have a long happy hour, but the drinks are pretty weak in my opinion. Considering that it's a Pub I won't be too critical as I don't drink beer. The food was decent and the service wasn't bad.",
  "Distinctly British atmosphere that lacks distinctly British menu. Baker St. hit the nail on the head in regards to the look and feel of a British pub, but with a dinner menu that only has two British dishes, shepherds pie and fish and chips, it unfortunately really misses the mark. Most of the menu is regular old bar food and Mexican foods, which really didn't make sense. \n\nThe food was somewhere between okay and good, service was slow due to our server being the only server working during Sunday brunch hours (not his fault, but it took forever). Fish and chips was 15 dollars for 2 pieces of fish, a half order was 10 dollars.\n\nBottom line: I won't be back due to the menu not matching up with my expectations, fairly expensive for what we got in both amount and quality.",
  "Would have been 1 star if it wasn't for a nice bartender and a cool couple at the  bar. Between problems with the draft system making a good beer impossible to a 45:min  wait for a dinner salad. That was sitting in water in the bowl. It was sad",
  "Baker St. Pub & Grill serves up English classics like fish and chips with a side of beer. They usually have live music performances. The design of the restaurant adds to the atmosphere of actually being in a pub. The food is good and service is not bad. During the week it is a bit quiet so try going either at night or on the weekend. I do not usually go here when I am in Town Square, but it is fine."

  "The food, drinks are fantastic here, this review is the for service received last night. My husband I have been going here for years, it\u2019s a favorite. We always sit at the bar and have our favorite, the Shaggy Dog, and an assortment of sushi. We\u2019ve always had outstanding bartender service. Last night Steven styli our drink and food order. We were promptly delivered our drinks. We ordered another round just before 6 to receive the happy hour price. Usually the bartender correctly understands he will charge it, then pour when we have finished our first drink.. he poured right away and drinks sat there getting warm.. but no biggie. A half an hour goes by, and people that came sat down and ordered after us, were receiving their food. We asked Steven to check on our meal. He comes right back with it and said \u201c you ask, you receive\u201d. Really ?! No apology for it sitting there and WE had to ask?!",
  "Very delicious and reliable restaurant in the heart of Sugar Land town center! The Mexican  Japanese fusion is so unique in style and taste! Anyone looking to try sushi but is worried about taste or flavor should definitely try this place. I've been coming here for years and have tried a little bit of everything. \n\nParking can be found right behind the restaurant in the parking garage. \n\nHad the volcano sushi and shaggy dog. For appetizer it was Jalapeno cream cheese. Dessert for \"heart attack\" (warm cinnamon roll-type cake with ice cream) - definitely try this!",
  "the food is good, but it\u2019s gone downhill quality wise over the years. it doesn\u2019t taste as fresh. nonetheless there\u2019s still Japaneiro\u2019s go-to appetizers, like the crab puffs, dumplings, or spicy garlic edamame- and of course the shaggy dog is a great original. I really like other rolls as well. biggest thing is that the service can be slow and the food is pricey unless you do their amazing lunch special deal on weekdays",
  "Awesome atmosphere, professional hostesses who handled the waiting crowd well... Shout out to Chris at the bar!!! \ud83e\udd17\ud83c\udf79  Delicious food, can't wait to return! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83e\udd38\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe",
  "I've frequented this establishment for 4+ years and the quality has never disappointed. The sushi rolls are done with a finesse; their by the piece is fresh and melts in the mouth. The staff have always been amazing so it goes to show they really know how to employ the right people for their atmosphere. I decided to go for my birthday a couple of days ago and they really made it special with flawless service, cuisine and a personal touch of amazing for the candle lit dessert they presented me. I strongly recommend this place for any occasion from a quick stop in to a group gathering/celebration. If you love fresh ingredients, delicious drinks(non/alcoholic ), stunning service then this is definitely a place you should check out for yourself."

  "Benihana has been a place for personal celebrations for years. We went this time \"just because\", but that didn't diminish the experience at all.\n.\nAll the regular things were still great. The show was fun, if a bit campy by now. The waitress was super attentive at the right times. The food was terrific; I'd actually forgotten how much I enjoy Benihana dishes.\n.\nMy wife added scallops, which were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. I had the trio, and while the shrimp were fine, they didn't add much for me; I'll skip then next time.\n .\nOverall, this is hard to beat for a weeknight special night out, or \"just because\".",
  "Interesting restaurant where you can enjoy the cooking time. This is kind of Japanese's style restaurant. And the food is so good. Drinks is also impressive.",
  "The food was mediocre. Too salty. Their soup was delicious. Good chef comes and makes the food on table. It was busy and took time for food to come out. Not a bad experience, the service was good and the chef was entertaining.",
  "Just hope you do not have birthday coupon to redeem or that when you go there is no one there. Went with my wife to celebrate her birthday, as this was her favorite restaurant, and we planned on redeeming the coupon that Benihana sends for birthdays. Wife and I share a plate but always order a ton of appetizers and extras(extra steak and lobster, etc) so that way we can meet the coupon requirements. First, the manager comes out and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure if you read the coupon or not but you need to purchase two entrees\u201d. The coupon does not say that. Next, since we were the only two guests at the time of dining, the chef \u201cTom\u201d was rude, cooked the food poorly and just looked mad the entire time he has to cook for only two people. It\u2019s not the consumers fault the restaurant is not busy. In addition, he is asking about the coupon requirements himself. I understand the manager asking, despite how he asked, but now even the chef. We came here all the time but how they treat people when it comes to birthdays and discounts sent by the company itself is ridiculous. The waiter was the only saving grace for the experience but it\u2019s a shame that special days are handled in this manner and that consumers are treated differently at different time of the day and level of how many people are there. The place has gradually lost its customer service and respect over the years.",
  "Went here for an early dinner on Memorial Day with my mom and sisters and we enjoyed it very much.  We had made reservations but didn\u2019t really need them as it was pretty empty at 4pm, were seated as soon as we walked in.  We were all dressed pretty casually and didn't feel out of place.  I got the filet mignon and lobster tail, both were cooked very nicely.  Presentation was good, service was good, place was clean, nice atmosphere, overall it was a great dinner.  No complaints. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd17"

I love that you can get a slider size burger as I can only eat half a full size one generally. Overall, they have good options, but there\u2019s something about it that keeps it from being really great. \n\nThe vibe is laid back and comfortable. They have a small patio that\u2019s covered and fills up first on nice days. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s an enjoyable experience for burgers and fries. The crepe I tried was meh though."

My only problem was with a credit I had earned when doing a previous large catering order. It was two 25 dollar credits only good in July. I asked if I could use them both and was told no. I was not jazzed about that but understood. I was also told that I could not use my cards if anyone ordered a special on the menu. With 4 people ordering it was embarrassing to tell them not to order a special. To me that is being pretty nit picky. If you reward a large catering order with a discount let them use it... Don't split hairs.",
  "Their food and service are both very good. There was a mistake with my order and the waiter was quick to fix it and even gave me a new plate. The quality of food is amazing. Even a simple plate like spaghetti was wonderful and very fresh tasting. The pork fish was also very flavorful and yummy. The desserts were very good, especially the apple one. We\u2019re never going to Olive Garden again! For a few dollars extra you can get delicious Italian food that is much better quality.",

We wanted to do something different so drove from San Antonio to have great Turkish food in a place I thought was the best. I told him Turquoise Grill has great ambiance and great food. I was very very wrong. \nThe place was empty, the food was bad, the service was  careless, nonchalant,  and rude (I asked a question to the waiter - in English-  he looked at me like I was from an outer space and walked away without even acknowledging me). \nIt is a shame that the hired band members were friendlier than the in house staff. I will neither recommend not ever go to that place again...",
  "We went on the last day of Houston Restaurant Week. Turquoise Grill is in the heart of Sugar Land's Town Center, just down from City Hall. \n\nAs we walked over, a line of people were posing on the front steps of City Hall. It must have been a human art display because it was dark when we walked back and they were all sitting with heads down in the same spots. \n\nA lot of the shops were closed for Labor Day, but the restaurant had several tables of customers on the sidewalk patio. We chose to eat inside.\n\nIt's a pretty little restaurant. We hadn't been here in a while. Glad we came. My husband had the shrimp-topped Scottish Salmon with shrimp cocktail as appetizer and rice pudding for dessert. His salmon was perfectly grilled and the best I've tasted in years! The cocktail had five big, tender shrimp. The cinnamon-dusted rice pudding was fine, but would have looked nicer served in a little glass or ceramic bowl rather than a styrofoam cup.   \n\nMy choice was the sampler appetizer, grilled lamb chops and baklava. I have to say that it was really, really good!\n\nHummus + falafel + quinoa tomatoes + baba ghanoush + dolmades + pita bread = happiness! I could have stopped eating after this platter and been fine. The smokiness of the baba ghanoush was wonderful.\n\nThe medium grilled lamb chops are pink inside and so tasty! There was plenty of mashed potatoes and just enough grilled vegetables. The only issue I had was that the baklava wasn't as light and crispy as I've had. It was a flat-ish healthy version, with no honey drizzle on top. \n\nOverall, the exceptional entrees and my Mediterranean sampler made for a memorable dinner."

Whatever you get here you can't go wrong!!",

Ask for the vegetarian menu, they have a separate menu for that. The original menu doesnt have a lot of vegetation options in it. We got the grilled mushrooms Lupe and puffy tacos. The Lupe was amazing, never tried something like that before. Their beans has great flavor and is not bland like other Mexican places do. They added corn and tomatoes to it which I think enhanced the taste. \n\nThe  puffy tacos were huge and not your typical taco size. They had a lot of cheese in it and we loved it!",

So for years we have been eating lard not knowing so a very big thank you goes to Chevron but with a D. Not to mention he is very good at making sure we were well taken care of. If your in the area on the Saturday or Sunday evening ask for Devron he\u2019s one of the best there.. He gets all 5 stars!!!",
  "We went there for dinner early on a Saturday evening with friends and we had 4 kids ranging from 1 year till 4.5 year old with us. Most of the place was empty when we were seated. It took a long time for our server to come and take the drinks order and longer for him to bring the drinks out. Once we ordered our food (it was hard to flag down our server and took really long to place the food order) it took very long for the food to come out and then also they got the order wrong. I am gald they gave us a table next to the patio as half of the time we were outside entertaining the kids while waiting for the food. The food was very delicious and the cocktails were good. The problem was the service - it was very very slow even when the restaurant was not full to begin with. Had they taken the order early on I bet we would have enjoyed the food and the place lot more. Kids would have been in much better mood as well. Would like to visit again and hopefully the service will be better then.",

  "Service is very quick,the menu is limited but tastes good.I usually order the bowl with the clianto rice and steak .\nIt's a clean and warm space.\nYou can decide to eat outside in the patio.",
  "I love coming to this location for lunch! Not only are you guaranteed a delicious, healthy, and satisfying meal but you're always greeted with a smile as soon as you walk in the door. The staff really takes care of you and goes above and beyond when a customer needs it. One time I dropped my entire bowl on accident and the staff was quick to reassure me that everything was fine - didn't even make a big deal about it, cleaned up the mess on the spot and hooked me up with a brand new bowl just the way I had ordered it. I really can't praise them enough, thanks guys! Five stars all the way!!",
  "Quick service.  Staff is kind. Food is good.",
  "Took 2 veggie bowls with tortillas.\nWhen making the bowl we asked the guy to put everything veggie only.\nWhen we were paying, we were charged extra for the Quesso in the bowl.\nPerson making the bowl should have notified us before putting it as least. If nothing else they should have sign on the Quesso container that would tell the customer it is not included in the standard pricing for the bowl.\nAlso we were charged for the tortillas which were suppose to be included."

I've seen 2 managers so far, they were both very nice. I love the prices and items for the kid's meals. I also love the lunch specials. I highly recommend this place.",
  "The service was good, food was no good. The first and last time I will visit a Red Lobster. I was really looking forward to it as I'm from a different country and had always heard people talking about Red Lobster. If they opened a store in my home country, they wouldn't even last a week. Only thing I enjoyed was the cheddar biscuits. Definitely not value for you money either.",
  "Jon, was his name. Our server made the dinner an awesome feeling. He made sure all was right for us. Great job oh, the food was awesome lobster cooked just right, king crab legs not chewy. Dinner was delivered at right time and no food overlap. You know what I mean, not done with appetizers and dinner shows up. This is the best restaurant in Sugar Land.",
  "Great service. Good food. Food came out in a timely manner, was cooked well. Prices have gone up....hooray for inflation. \ud83d\ude12 All in all, good decent place to eat.",
  "Nice clean restaurant the service was excellent the food came out nice and hot and full of flavor. They give you nice bit of food for your money. Ps this has been one of the best locations I have been to. I will return."

  "This place is awesome! With very good not so common drinks that are a must try you have to check this place out! The Sugar Refinery has great snacks and a really good stake night! They even have flights on the menu for you drinking pleasure haaa. Over all a great place to sit and catch up with friends. The bar tenders are very nice and super knowledgeable. They ask the wright questions to get into your brain and serve you just what you never knew you were looking for. I will be a long time guest of this place! The smoked old fashioned was very delicious.",
  "With not too many places in Sugar Land with a night life lounge feel to it Sugar Refinery is our go to. Great drinks, good music on the weekends and service is good. They can get busy so have to patient sometimes. But Zach the manager and Albert the bartender are usually there to make sure you have a good time.",
  "Huge drink menu; something for everyone! Good food, music, and ambiance!",
  "I was there on Tuesday afternoon, such a great ambiance! We got there early, our table was set up and our waiter was ready to take drinks orders. Lots of cocktail options, the best was their old fashion with smoke!!  The service was great and the food was good. Wish there\u2019s more food options! But overall good experience"

Apart from the usual Mexican rice and various beans that most places serve fajitas with, there was the option to get cilantro rice, fried plantains and grilled vegetables as sides also.

  "Dear Assistant Manager, \nCustomers who order and pay together should\nNot have to mention they would like their food served either at the same time or close together. One person should not receive their food 10 minutes before the other just because one meal takes longer to cook. A NORMAL restaurant would time the cooking of the food appropriately so both meals come out to the customers in close proximity or together. It\u2019s not wise to tell customers the burden of explaining that concept is on them. I won\u2019t be back. This is a second occurrence and there are too many good rating options seconds away to deal with this ridiculous expectation. Good luck.",

  "Almost every time I order from this location, some aspect of my order is wrong, whether it's forgetting sauce, swapping a regular sandwich for an unlabeled spicy sandwich, or just giving me burnt and dry chicken minis.\n\nOn top of that, their breakfast menu is half the normal selection. They don't offer the chicken bagel, the bacon egg cheese, the sausage egg cheese, or the grilled chicken muffin. Just chicken biscuits and minis, which are good, but sometimes I want something different.",
  "I had a great experience here. I arrived close to 2 pm and the place was crowded...inside and drive through. Yet the staff was courteous, and friendly and the lines moved surprisingly quickly, I was able to place my order expeditiously and received my meal to my table very quickly. The chicken strips were rather small they looked bigger on the menu. My fries were cold and soggy but the staff happily changed them for me and gave me some freshly fried... definitely will return to this location.",

Customer service was friendly and sweet, but  i hate the only thing I can order from there is the wraps... I do love the avacado dressing",
  "I pull up an the girl offers to help.  I tell her i am there to pick up an order for Joe.  She doesn't say a word and walks off.\n\nThe second employee approaches.  I tell her I am there for a pick up for Joe.  She can not find the order.  After a few moments she says pull to the window, they do have it.\n\nI pull forward in Lane 2 and tell the police officer I am.here to pick up an order.  He says did I order?  I tell him, no, I am here to pick one up.  He says I am not understanding him that I need to get back in line.\n\nAs I pull around, I tell one of the supervisors I am here to pick up an order, I have already gone through the line, but the cop wants me back in again after I already went through.\n\nHe says okay get in line.  My response:  no I am not going to wait again I will just cancel the order.  The employees response: nonchalantly says okay and displays no care to resolve the issue.\n\nIf Chic Fil A had a low standard, this was by far the restaurant that aced the low standards exam.  I almost thought I was at McDonalds for a moment with the care free attitude and poor handling of service."

It moved too easily and wasn't that comfy. Other than that, the portions are really big and the food was good. I would come back.",

I was told it was quite spicy, but it wasn't that hot.  However, it was super delicious.  It was also plentiful.\n.\nThe decor was modern and simple. It was also clean. When the adjacent couple were done and left, the single employee hurried over and cleaned thoroughly and with sanitizer. Impressive.\n.\nI enjoyed the meal and this easy entry into the world of poke. I look forward to going back."

  "Amazing place!!!! Best dark chocolate I've ever had (try it melted, it will blow your mind). They've got fair trade chocolate, hot chocolate/drinking chocolate made in store and shredded chocolate (milk and two kinds of dark Peruvian and Dominicana) to make your own. They make their own marshmallows!! Ask to try the sea foam chocolates if you like caramel but not the sticky gooey part. Its crunchy and covered in chocolate and delicious!!!! The owners are very sweet and knowledgeable, they let you taste most things in store to see what you like and honestly there's so much awesome stuff here it's hard to even describe it all. From caramel apples made in store with half a dozen different toppings, sea salt turtles, truffles of assorted flavors, fudge, ice cream, marshmallows dipped in chocolate on a stick, cakes with ice cream, etc etc. There are even gummy bears/worms and lemon drops and malt balls. I could keep going but really you should go here yourself if you like chocolate or sweets at all!!",
  "Amazing selection of chocolates, fudge and delicious ice cream! I also wanted to say thank you for responding to my google maps chat so quickly! They are open and available for curbside pickup. I picked up an awesome looking chocolate ice cream cake today.",
  "Stumbled across this gem after reading the Sugar Land/Missouri City newspaper and I'm super stoked that I did. Tonight was our first time visiting Kilwins and I must say, hands down the BEST ice cream ever! Can't wait for the family and I to go back and try their other gourmet treats.",
  "Nice new addition to Town Square. An assortment of candies from fudge, clusters, chocolate covered pretzels, and more. Variety of ice cream flavors that I would love to try each and every one. They also have ice cream cakes to buy and toppings for your ice cream. Plenty of staff to help who were very friendly. \n\nCandies are bit overpriced, but they do provide a good serving amount when you get ice cream. Kilwin\u2019s track, Banana fudge pie, and peach were delicious.",

  "The appearance is really clean, trendy and well-lit. It felt bright and cheerful walking in. \n\nYou order at the counter and they bring your order to the table. There's a self-serve water station.\n\nThe staff is very welcoming and friendly, and so helpful with recommendations. There was a staffer out in the dining area making sure things stayed neat and customers didn't need anything. That was a big plus. The sinks are outside the restrooms, making it convenient to just wash your hands if the delicious sauces get all over. \n\nThe chef came out to assure us that he picked the best lamb chops for our order. Pretty thoughtful! \n\nFood came out hot. The sides, creamy corn and coleslaw were really good. Two from-the-cooler bottles of their sauces are places on your table. The garlicky one is so good, and the hot sauce is pretty good. \n\nMaybe it's how they do it, but my chicken was somewhat over-cooked. The four lamb chops were very, very flavorful, but ... not tender. Chinese lamb dishes are so tender, I guess grilled lamb is different. \n\nMaybe we will give it another try.",
  "I happened to be in Sugarland and decided to eat and ended up at this place, we had no idea about this place.\nLet me begin with the ambience of the restaurant. It was well lit, very welcoming and trendy spot. The women who took our order was extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. She was very informative about the sauce and even let us try it out before we made a decision.\nNow on to the food. Hot Damn!! The chicken was delicious. It was flavorful and moist. We got the Hot sauce and it was just the right amount of spicy with still getting the chicken flavor. Rice was aromatic and cooked to perfection. The fries had a lemon  and spice flavor and I couldn't stop eating them. \n10/10 would recommend.",
  "I've had this location on my list for a while, and was delighted to make the visit. Our order was taken by a friendly staff member who made us feel welcomed. For two of us, we got the All-for-one combo which had two quarter pieces of chicken and one regular side. Although the leg & thigh piece was smaller than the breast & wing, I thought it was more flavorful. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and I will recommend a visit.",
  "Excellent chicken,  great concept.  I have tried Nando's Peri Peri in Washington DC and this was quite similar.   You order and pay at the counter and they bring your food out to you. We ordered a whole chicken, corn, cassava fries and a rice bowl.  Everything was delicious. The space was compact but well designed.",
  "The place to be to try the best chicken... I would say better than Nandos. Vegetarian options also available. Must try the hot sauce. Courteous staff and a very pleasant atmosphere."

  "Read the menu before you go:  it's pricey for using so many canned ingredients. The overhead pinatas would be cute if they weren't so faded. Try somewhere else if you want fresh Tex-Mex.",
  "Lunch was very good! Reasonably priced and filling. The service was exceptional.",
  "Cockroach Alert!!! The restaurant was hot as hell and it was only 59 degrees outside. Basically a hot spot for roaches... the man brought us to go boxes with a suprise... A Roach!!! Ugh. Also the waiters need to learn how to speak in a soft voice if they want to use vulgar language.",
  "Our order was taken quickly. Meals were served in big portions. I love Mexican food and have eaten in different restaurants in different places. Sadly, I must say that I didn't enjoy the food here at all, neither did my family. Great service though. I must warn you: Don't order the tilapia - it has an aftertaste!"

  "Came right before the lunchtime rush. Staff was really friendly and the food was delicious! It's a small space with plenty of seating, and a calm peaceful atmosphere. I look forward to another visit~!",
  "The food is amazing here. Didn\u2019t know about this place for a long time . The food choice is Lott and they do have vegetarian options . Loved the chicken rice and shrimp  mee goreng.. the meat pie was okayish ..the quantity is huge",
  "We been to Singapore few time recently, this food is similar to some of the food there, not as bold but good enough. The lunch special is great, good and reasonable.\n\nWe had the Hainanese chicken\nSalted fish fried rice\nFried flat noodles with chicken",
  "Met my beloved aunt & uncle there for lunch with my mother - had a great time because of the great people I was enjoying lunch with and the cafe's excellent food and ambience.\n\nTried five different dishes that I've never had before outside of the normal restaurants we go to and each was a pleasant surprise. Super price during lunch and each dish was fresh, looked good and most importantly, tasted great! Tried the salted fish and chicken fried rice and it was the best I ever had! Had to try to ubiquitous Hainan Chicken & Rice since the name is \"Singapore Cafe\" and that too was mighty tasty and prepared with love by one of the owners.\n\nSo if you got some time during a busy day for lunch, I highly recommend this little mom & pop eatery - support local but you're getting big time food as a bonus!",
  "Am I glad I found this place. There's just number of Singaporean food in Houston and this was highly recommended thru a friend who really know his food. \nWe can in on a Thur lunch time, when we just arrived around 11 o'clock, place was very quiet. It got super busy later on and became just bit nosy. \n\nThe owner stayed in different countries in east Asian, so his menu has some influence and dishes from all over those place. I have never been to Singapore however Malaysia. The dishes that from Malaysia was pretty good. Very similar to the one I had there. \n\nDishes that we ordered:\n1. Sambal Shrimp with Okra: Shrimp is very fresh. I like the texture of the Okra, not too soft. bit crunchy. And the sambal sauce is superb. \n2. Roti: One of my favorite. We finished it in no time. Love the spicy sauce they put on the side for you to dig in. However you can eat with or without. \n3. Hainanese Chicken rice: We had the lunch portion, rice is very good, different than the regular rice and its soaked with chicken broth, smells good.  And the chicken is pretty soft yet  juicy. \n4. Homemade Rib soup: super delicious. They put some Chinese herbs in it and the sweetness of the ribs came out mixed with the herb, very good for your body. \n5. Seafood stir fried flat noodle: I was shocked when I got this dish. It's different from anyone else. It was bit more soupy. I thought it might be weird, but on the contrary very flavorful. \n6. Singapore milk tea: A must try, it taste like the indian pulled tea yet you can taste the Chinese milk tea in it as well. \n\nI would definitely come back for the Malaysia dishes that's on the menu. I think they would do great on it too."

It wasn\u2019t really busy when I came in so I got to the counter and ordered right away. Very clean inside! Service was prompt and friendly. Very quick too! Half a dozen oof kolaches, a dozen of donuts and 2 donut holes later.. my staff was well fed and major food coma too! Best feeling :)",
  "After being deeply disappointed at Dunkin on SH 6, I decided to give the Shipley a shot. \nThis Shipley location had Bavarian creams and some powered donuts. I asked for three of each for a half dozen. I would have only picked up one or two, but it\u2019s $5 minimum cc charge/debit and I didn\u2019t have cash. \nTasted fresh enough in the middle of running my afternoon errands and it lasted a few days as we had 1 or 2 a day, for breakfast. \nRecommending this location.",
  "The lady behind the counter was personable.  However, below average quality donuts.",
  "Shipley Do-Nuts is a Texas symbol. Go ahead and mention Krispy Kreme or Dunkin to Texans and they'll be quick to lay you know. . that's not a real donut lol. I love coming to Shipley when I come into town for two reasons: \n\n1) their hot regular glazed donuts \n2) THE KOLACHES\n\nWhat I love about their donuts is that they are yeast donuts. According to their website, \"The donut that started it all was a glazed yeast donut. This donut has a light interior with a slightly crispy outside and smothered in the traditional glaze or a variety of other toppings including icing, sprinkles, nuts, coconut, and cinnamon-sugar. When eating one of our yeast donuts, you can imagine the sensation of biting into a cloud.\"\n\nThe cloud aspect, is true. When biting into a Shipley donut, you question \"what Krispy Kreme?\". \n\nNow the kolaches. To be honest, I never had one until I came to Texas. I didn't even know what one was until my boyfriend introduced them to me a couple years ago. Everyone I go, I get the same one. The jalape\u00f1o and cheese one. Amazing every time. \n\nOur order when my boyfriend and I are together are the same. \n- 3 glazed \n- 3 kolaches \n- 2 bottles of water \n$12"

  "If I could give ZERO stars, I would. The girl that took my order was really friendly and took the time to tell me the different deals going on within the store, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, my card declined and I had to call back the store to give them my other card, no biggy. HOWEVER, when I called back the store, the manager was EXTREMELY rude towards me. I understand that I placed my order about 15 minutes before they closed, but you DON'T treat the customer rudely. I've worked for Pizza Hut before for almost three years, we believe in BLAST, and we always treated the customer with the utmost respect, no matter WHAT time it was after we opened, or minutes before we closed. Even the driver that delivered my order was friendly and I appreciated him being honest when I asked him questions about who took my payment information. I tried to look past the manager being RUDE towards me, but once I got inside and looked at my order, I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The bacon cheese stuffed crust was NOT how it should have been, extremely greasy and the bacon cheese cylinders were not proportioned the way they should have been. I specifically asked that my wings be DOUBLE FRIED and they obviously were not fried twice as I asked, and therefore were soggy and not crunchy they way they should have been; had they been DOUBLE FRIED. Even the cookie I ordered wasn't fully cooked and still tasted doughy. Again, I get it, I ordered roughly 15 minutes before closing time, but that still isn't an excuse as to why I was treated rudely by the manager taking my payment information, and why my order wasn't fulfilled the way I asked. I don't plan on ordering here EVER again after my experience tonight and recommend anyone considering ordering here NOT to at night.. prepare to be disappointed and treated rudely by the manager.",

  "FOOD WAS TRASH!!!\nI  drove 8.5 miles to this location because l had 3 horrendous experience at the store right down the street. This location wasn't any different, the food was absolutely horrible!  I just threw it in the trash to include the Sprits which was only carbondaled water.. It appeared to have been recooked (more than once) and it was still cold. It took about 10-12 minutes to return home.\nWARNING. CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!!\nWith everyone (Pandemic) going  to \"Pick Up or Delivery Only\"  a lot of establishments are forgetting product quality.",
  "Very rude customer service! Smoke covered the dining area, probably from poor ventilation. Awful place!",
  "Nice people but they wouldn't discount the chicken anymore even when we ordered 100 pieces! Love Church's chicken but this order was for a church function!!!",
  "A week of this place... Very friendly with the exception of a couple times i had to check the attitude, afterwards smooth sailing. The food was fresh hot and delicious everytime!",
  "This place is HORRIBLE!!! The customer service for the drive thru clerk was simply pathetic..... The rice was greasy and watery.... who makes cajun rice watery.... that must mean you dont know how to cook rice outside of your job... sad! Then when I looked at the chicken it was friend extra hard and half way burnt. She looked like she had an attitude when I told her to just refund me my entire order..... As long as I come to this side of town I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION"

The building is easy to locate from the street with a wic logo on the front next to the library's name. It was quiet and calm on early Thursday morning compared to other offices I've been to which is perfect if you have a newborn or healing from csection. They are open on every Thursdays, then every 1st and 3rd Friday some Saturdays as well. The staff are kind and friendly. Make see sure you have everything they ask you to bring. The wait time was reasonable and nothing to complain over. I would highly recommend this location and its in the library so you can read a hood book while you wait which is a bonus. Please like this if you found it helpful",

I would recommend everyone go there. Its located inside the Blue Ridge Library. Easy to find. They are open every Thursday and Friday but open every 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month. So go ahead and make Blue Ridge WIC office your new WIC office. You're going to love it.",

From the permanent staff to the volunteers. They are caring and always willing to help. Mr. Dru is super nice and helpful, and the kids love that he's so funny. I love that he says what he means and means what he says. Honesty goes a long way and there should be more people like Mr. Dru in charge. He does a great job at welcoming and getting to know the kids and families that go to the library. Even though this particular library doesn't have the books I was looking for, I can still place a hold on them and the library that does have it sends it here. So it all works out. Overall, it's a great library!",

Ms. Jacqueline is always ready to assist us when she is there, she is knowledgeable and always wearing a smile. Mr. Drew is also nice and helpful.

I've been there several times this year, but the last few weeks have been disappointing. The crawfish are small and dirty. They are not rinsing them properly before boiling. They are even saltier than before. I don't know what is going on there now. I will not be going back. I used to drive past many other crawfish places to get there but, I will have to find me another crawfish spot.",

  "Update From My Friend: So owner or one of the owners reached out to me today. He was very apologetic and assured me that I should have absolutely been let it  in (i mean... Have you seen me? ) and that he was very disappointed in his staff that night. He supports tattoos and anyone with them (just not overly explicit or gang bangers.... Sorry mom). He's reteaching and instructing staff upon company policy and defining it more clearly for staff and general public. He did give me his direct number and asked that I hit him up if we ever come out that he'd like to take care of us.\n\nI am appalled that this place is even in business. A Beautiful woman was not allowed in this bar because of her neck tattoo. Now to clarify, her neck tattoo isn't a gang related thing or derogatory in any way but a stunning piece of art. I've attached a photo so all can see how ridiculous this is. I am just stunned that this happened and will make it known to all I can that they should never go here!",

Sorry the only way I could post was by clicking on a star. This is an undeserved star",

  "We got the Captain Crunch and Boston Cream donuts, fried chicken donut sandwich (\ud83d\ude0b), veggie burrito, and iced tea. If we had only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the tea, this would have been a 4 \u2b50 experience. Not impressed with the donuts. Didn't have much flavor and seemed dry even though it was only about 9:30am. Veggie burrito had sad potatoes with a strangely rubbery texture.",

This is a great menu item here.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Texas pecan coffee was pretty damn good too.  If you buy one of their SS coffee cups you get one free refill at each visit.  Pretty awesome.  \n\nWe got there on a Saturday morning around 9:30.  The place was hoppin but we only had to wait a couple minutes to get a table for 4.  The food came out pretty quick for them to be that busy.  And it was great.",

It's very family friendly and customer's faces become familiar as they are friendly as well. I brought a few family members here today and they loved it. When I left I realized my order had egg on it  which I don't eat. One phone call corrected that problem. Customer service is usually not a problem at this establishment. I would definitely recommend if your looking for a sweet fix or tasty lunch.",

  "After gym me and my buddy came to this place for a quick bite. After looking at the menu I was carried away and couldn't decide what I wanted. I end up getting combo gyro meal(chicken and lamb) , which comes with fries and fountain drink and also I got chicken shawarma to go( forgot to take pics of that). \n\nIn few minutes our food was served. I was impressed with the portion of gyro. It was nicely packed with chicken and lamb.\n \nGyro was very delicious the pita bread was soft and delicious. Chicken and lamb tasted delicious. They both had a unique flavor and burst of both flavors complemented each other. On the other hand fries were on the different level, they were seasoned with  spices and herbs and they were amazing.\n\nMy wife ate the shawarma and she told me that it was delicious. Next time I will have to try it on my own to explain.\n\nOverall experience was good, great food, great entertainment and a great service!",
  "Healthy is misleading. Good gyro meat though. The combo plate meal photos are misleading. The image for a schwarma for instance shows the wrap cut in half over a bed of veggies and rice. All I received was just the wrap not cut in a foil wrapper. When I inquired about the veggies and rice, I was told I could get fries. \n\nAll of the fountain drinks are super sweet.\n\n A little pricy for sub par \"Healthy\" options.",
  "Ate here for the first time and it was so good. First time trying hummus and LOVED it!!! Everything was very fresh and tasty. Will definitely come back when in the area.",
  "I came across them by luck. I am very glad I did. I had the gyro fries. They were friendly when I ordered. They were quick. They brought it to my car. The process was smooth. The food was delicious. I recommend giving them a try. They also have great lunch specials I saw on the window.",
  "The Gyro Guys is a nice enough place to eat with a variety of offerings. I have sampled the gyro (lamb), mixed plates (lamb & chicken), and the garlic fries.\n\nThe Gyro is pretty good; the bread is soft, meat is juicy, and the taste is there. The only problem is that I've gotten mixed consistency with the preparation of the gyro. At times it has been delicious, and other times, not so much. The size of the Gyro is pretty big so it definitely fills you up.\n\nMixed plates are a go-to; with lamb, chicken, rice, a salad, and different sauces, it's a pretty well-rounded meal. And quite delicious, too. I find the small plates a little too small and the larger portion difficult to finish.\n\nI tried the garlic fries on one occasion; although they were alright, they had gotten soggy really quickly with the garlic sauce ladled right on top.\n\nI never eat in the restaurant because I don't like the dining room or the odor that hits you when you enter. I always take my order to-go.\n\nOverall, it's not a place that will overwhelm your senses but it gets the job done."

We enjoy the Perry's franchise,  however this locale offers a more unique and personal touch in addition to a more casual style of dining while enjoying top shelf cuisine you may also drop in to pick up some of the best quality meats the Houston area has to offer to bring home and grill yourself.  A place they truly remember your name and you will be glad you came.",

Minutes later she walked up to my car and handed me my food and as I was pulling up to park and eat my food, I noticed something cold and to my surprise, it was a Dilly Bar (ice cream bar). That was so sweet and I think they did that as a sorry for the wait, but the wait was literally only like 3 min. Keep up the great work guys!",

  "Great kolaches! I love their light and buttery bread.",
  "The donuts are good, probably the best on Scarsdale and better than Dunkin Donuts which is a little south down the road.",
  "We come here all the time. Kolaches are always fresh and sometimes they give free donuts in the afternoon upon purchase",

  "Kimchi fries are OK. A little bit soggy. The smoothies aren't smooth and have too many ice chunks. The Thai tea is good. Prices are about average. Not much seating so not good for groups.",
  "Lovely place! Staff/owners were super cool and extremely helpful and informative of their selections! Had a jasmine tea that was very high quality with nice strong  floral notes. A must-stop for avid tea drinkers.  Will go back!",
  "Nice little boba shop. Their coffee with fluffy frozen coconut drink is amazing.",
  "Love this place. Friendly staff. Fast and efficient. Drinks are good. I love their Jasmin Milk Tea.",
  "Best iced milk tea in the area! Trust me I have tried a lot here. I asked for less sugar and it's just about right. The girl said they use black sugar and black tea here. Their milk tea tastes strong of tea:)"

  "This is place is a hidden gem. Good food good service. A pretty good selection of sandwiches and salads and soup as well. I recommend to give it a try at least.",
  "This is a quality place.  Owned by the family they are so nice.  This is what a family owned business should be like in Texas.  The sandwiches are a good size and there are all kinds of drinks and chips to choose from.  And while you wait you can hit the dive shop up next door that they also run.  Great place!"

  "I typically dont leave reviews for fast food but the service at this location was top notch! I was very impressed. Unfortunately good customer service is hard to find these days but the manager AND employees (or at least the ones that were there this evening) were fantastic. The food was hot and fresh, the lobby was clean, all around a great experience. Keep it up! :)",
  "Vistied here today. We are at the drive thru ordering popcorn chicken meal. And we asked the person taking our order... if the large box would feed to people? In ENGLISH and he said I don't speak Spanish:/ My husband said back in not talking to you in Spanish. I asked if the large box of popcorn chicken would feed to people. He said okay you want the large order:/. Then we pull up and he is as Mexican as can be. What's wing with speaking Spanish? Just like what's wrong with speaking in sign language? NOTHING",
  "Great service. Little bit of a wait, but all of my food was fresh, and the cashier even hooked me up with a quencher size drink for no charge. Absolutely going back here again.",
  "Came to get an order of churos and the lady taking the order (Tenesha) was very rude. Cut me off while I was talking. Just had an attitude like she didn\u2019t want to be at work (then go home!). Not only that, she was wearing the SAME gloves for every transaction she took, and every order she handed to the customers in front of me as she used for my order and transaction. Defeats the purpose of gloves during a pandemic.",

  "Decent place to grab a quick bite , considering not much food choices around. The place seems a little run down.  The chicken salad wasn't to bad . The onion rings seemed like they were left to long in the grease. I've had better at Burger King or whataburger. They seem to have good burgers and the prices seem fair.  If your trying to eat healthy I dont recommend this spot .",
  "Decided to try this place out. Personally my opinion I did not like the taste of the meat and I didn\u2019t like the bread either. The fries were ok.  But my mom said she loved everything. So you would just have to try it for yourself because everyone has different taste buds.",
  "Extremely slow!! Almost 40 minutes to have my lunch prepared. I ordered  chicken and white rice. I got fries instead of rice. Turns out they ran out of rice but I wasn't given the choice to pick another side. Very disappointed. Not coming back.",
  "The buns are homemade and delicious. They toast just right and the bulgoki are yummy. Haven't tried the Korean ramen yet but thats is next on my list."
