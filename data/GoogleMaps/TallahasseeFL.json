   "have been here a couple of times when visiting Tallahassee and I really enjoyed it both times.  It is not what you think of as a traditional MUSEUM.  It is very much an outdoor kind of place.  You Can learn a lot about Florida history and nature and see pretty plants and animals.",
   "This is a great place for everyone- kids, teens, dates, seniors, families. Beautifully located among vibrant scenery, each exhibit gives a taste of what is around us in the Gulf South. Their birthday parties are wonderful and they think of everything from start to finish; I could not be more appreciative and impressed with ours. When we have out of town visitors, this is one of the first places we take them. Becoming a member was a great idea for our family.",
   "Best decision was to get an annual pass. My toddler loves this place and I can bring family and friends for an easy day outside. There's lots of canopy to shade the entire trail and park. \nHighly recommend the zip lining. Best time to go is when they open as it's cool outside and the animals are active. Otherwise the animals hide in the shade or burrows.",
   "Love this place. Perfect for families. My daughter loves to come and see the animals and play on the playground. I myself want to try the tree to tree adventure.",
   "Had a GREAT time here! The staff was awesome and we had a ton of fun zip lining. We will definitely be back!"

   "Would have gotten 5 stars but as a person from out town it was hard finding the place. But once I did and found parking.  Seats were comfortable everyone was so nice. The bathrooms were pretty clean too",
   "I went there one night around 10:00 or 11:00pm to walk the park with my husband , it was very nice other people working out and walking their dogs. Some people actually stopped and took pictures of my husband and I which I thought that was amazing. Very nice will go back again.",
   "This is such a nice Park. It's very pleasant to walk here, go on a stroll, or ride those scooters. There's a few places to hammock and more to set up for a picnic. \nThey have an amphitheater, splash pad (with restrooms right next to it), and a small kickball zone near Monroe Street.\nThere's also a restaurant that's not too bad and a great coffee shop below.\nThis is a nice place to bring your dog or throw a frisbee.\nIt's a big open park where lots of activities can happen and yet not feel overcrowded. \n\nNow.. There is a small spot for kids to play (sandpit, one slide) but that's about it. The real attraction for kids is the splash pad.\n\nUnfortunately the city decided to build pretty much on top of this beautiful park and has disrupted the open view on one major side of the park. Time will tell how that changes everything.",
   "I personally like this park a lot. It's clean and very beautiful. The walk-ways are long and wide and it's the perfect place to unwind with friends. It is missing some shading but I like that. It feels very open and after being trapped in classrooms and libraries and in front of bedroom desks, it's pretty nice to go there and be free. It does need a light on the north eastern side of the park. Where the big turn in the road is there's a huge bush that leads to the pond, it needs a lamp there and maybe an emergency booth. As a girl, it doesn't feel safe to walk that corner at night. I kinda just scuttle past it. Granted it's been sometime since I've last gone; perhaps that's been alleviated. Last criticism, for some reason the city of Tallahassee doesn't seem to like making exercise parks with actual exercising equipment. Perhaps that's something for them to consider. What's the point of those long walking & running paths if there aren't other exercises that can be done along it?",
   "A delightful place to take a walk in the afternoon, or go for a run specially in the fall weather when it is cool and breezy. There\u2019s a beautiful memorial to the forgotten war (The Korean War) which has great symbolism and beauty. There\u2019s a great restaurant on the grounds with coffeehouse on the first floor in case you get hungry after taking in the wonderful sights."

   "Definitely a recommended stop while visiting Florida's capital city. The museum contains a small collection of objects from the colonial era as well as an introduction to the life of the inhabitants of this land. Although most of the buildings were constructed based on hystorical records, the live representations and explanations by the staff are really helpful to better understand the context where the mission developed. The entrance is $5 per adult and it's open from Tuesday to Sunday. Recommended!",
   "We found this to be a great place to spend the day with the kids. Open areas to run, we hiked through the woods, checked out really cool buildings, and learned many new things. Great time.",
   "This wonderful museum, (More like a time-travel!) , Is perfect for everybody! They have workshops you can do , and the staff is so kind! Perfect for tourists, schools, and people who just want to get away from the noisy part of town (Which we locals here all understand the struggle about).",
   "A beautiful place to learn about the Apalachee Indians tribe in the early 1700. Excellent restoration of the local tribe as well as the Spanish influence from the 1650 to 1700. Minimal admission (seniors are 3.00 each) it will take over 4 hours to really see all the exhibits. Really tells the history of a lost tribe.",
   "Worthwhile for history buffs.  Beautiful grounds, and guides in all buildings, explaining what you were seeing.  Has a real blacksmith showing the lost art.  Also used as destination wedding venues and other."

   "It never seems like all of the shops around are open? Currently under construction (in the opening where it happened to be my favorite, bummer) but the rest of the park is still amazing and fun and a great place to go on walks with friends, whether you're looking for something to do or not. There's several shops, art, a few small parks, places to park the scooters, and even a bike fixing station. Great walk, cool things.",
   "Eclectic, creative, friendly and always evolving. Enjoyed walking through the square and meeting the artists. 612 Gallery is definitely a must see!",
   "I enjoy the scenary of this area with the colors and the structure of the shops.  If you like crystal shops, herbal tea shops, art galleries, photography, and other activities then check out the Railroad Square Art District.",
   "Small location filled with so many fun pinball and arcade machines. It's worth splurging on an all day pass. Leave and get a meal. Come back to game until they close."

Highly recommend.",

Our family visits every year (usually more than once) and drive through then park and stroll for maximum experience.  If you need the holiday spirit, this is guaranteed. Also a nice little park year-round.",

   "There's so much to see about all aspects of Florida! The changing exhibits are great for seeing NEW things each time I come to visit, but even the permanent exhibits have me seeing new things when I look at them again. It's a great place to enjoy Florida's history!",
   "This museum was a lot of fun!  They had lots to do here for both kids and adults. We learned a lot about the history of Florida. It\u2019s a good stop off when you need to stretch your legs during a long road trip. The admission is free and they ask that you make a small donation. They had many different rooms and areas spanning over centuries.",
   "What a great day. The museum is downtown right by the state capital. It covers history of the state from the early Spanish influence to past WW2. Also covers ALL aspects of the state. We spent over 3 hours here just enjoying the full info of the state. 2 city blocks away from the state capital so park and walk. \nFREE admission and parking.",
   "We didn't research this visit much but saw it was recommended. Both our boys (10 and 12) enjoyed the museum with different parts being hits. Even grandma's attic was a hit with some fun moments. Way more to see than my photos, a ton of history from the early native America days, through Spanish occupation, statehood and World War II. The surf display was a nice bonus. You can easily use up 2+ hours here so I'm guessing it would range from 1-3 hours depending on your speed. Definitely worth a visit. The parking is $5, but free if you get a token from the front desk. Total cost, $0!",
   "The museum was very informative and hits the major details of Florida's history up to World War II. As a former tour guide and history buff, I found the most enjoyable part chatting with their docent there, Paul, who was well versed in the history of Florida and very friendly. I came on a slow day so was able to hog a lion's share of Paul's time, but by far his expertise and excitement about history was what made this trip so enjoyable."

Then I eventually left the sport and years passed.  Several years ago I made the first return to Tom Brown for model RC racing and it brought back many memories.  This past week I made another return to Tom Brown while in Tallahassee and it brought back even more memories.  The most amazing thing of the last 17 years is just how little the park has changed, while still making many improvements.  I'd love to return with a bike and ride the Greenway addition which previously did not exist years ago.",

There are collections of dolls, cash registers, golf memorabilia, boat motors, and much more. Gorgeous, pristine paint on every car and something to see for everyone!  (side note: they do not give admission discounts for veterans on veterans day; just one flat rate for all) Thank you Tallahassee Auto Museum for sharing this wonderful array of collections.",

   "There is a six mile Trail Fram one parking lot to the other. Not counting all the small branches which has no signage. \n\nThe place seems less crowded than Tom brown park. Every so often there will be a bench. Water fountains are only located at the parking lots.\n\n Be sure to wear a hat because the beginning of the trial is a wide-open plane, and later on you will be in miles and miles of woods.\n\nNot too many interesting finds here such as animals or interesting plants but overall this is a great trail for hiking and cycling.",
   "Good place for a hike. Either a long one or short. Walk through the woods and clearing. Found black berries. Water tower, even a cementary.  benches to take a break.cool spot to just walk."

Hats off to the Phipps family for the foresight of donating the land for this wonderful park and especially for this event. Thank you.",

Overall great scenery and would recommend you go on a cool and cloudy day be cause your going to sweat. A lot.",
   "Very nice park when the mosquitoes are dead in the winter. Bring bug spray if you go any other time.\n\nThe recreation fields always seem well maintained, but I usually go on the trails. There are quite a few downed trees from the past years hurricanes, but you can walk under or around them.\n\nThe trail itself is very pretty, with a lot of streams and one very neat waterfall. Not very populated, but the bike trail has people riding usually. \n\nThere are often people walking dogs without leashes here. Please leash your dogs, you can't control them when they are allowed to roam free, and it's dangerous for everyone. City leash laws apply here.",
   "Municipal soccer complex with many fields and not enough parking or family seating. Some fields have bleachers but most do not. The grass is in good shape and there are a couple of AstroTurf fields as well. There is a concession stand which has a good variety of food for cheap (breakfast, lunch, and snacks), but often long lines and questionable hygiene. The bathrooms are plentiful and clean and located in the center of the very large complex. \nBring a chair or a picnic blanket to sit on (and maybe a picnic) and prepare to cheer your kid's team on to victory! \nThere's no real shade, so in the summer consider a tailgate tent.\nNote: arrive early for best parking, prepare to wait in traffic to leave the complex, and this location is not handicapped accessible.",
   "The park offers a variety of trails including wooded, semi-wooded and wide trails and fields. I often see people hiking,  riding horses, and bikes in the park.\nHighly recommend!"

   "Just a beautiful example of PRE statehood architecture of a home build by a free black carpenter as a wedding gift for a white owner. Florida was awarded statehood after this house was built and the Knott family kept the original furnishings and wall paper (in the main hall only) when they gave the entire house to the government. \nPicture a home as a time capsule from 1928 to 1941! The outdoor kitchen and bath from the original 1843 home has been moved inside then left alone. Mrs. Knott did a great job decorating the house and even wrote poetry for many pieces of furniture. She was very active in prohibition and sufferage.Mr. Knott was in the government accounting. FREE admission but bring a good donation. It is worth the 2 plus hour guided tour.",

Maybe better displays, a mock hut to show what their daily lives were like, etc. So much history here that isn't really represented",

Colonel Robt. Butler's Plantation 1820c, mill dam & irrigation system can also be viewed from the nature trail.  Clean Restroom, ample parking, small fee, picnic tables, Pavilion, Interpretation Panels & Signs.  Visited in monsoon seasons so the grass, weeds etc. where overgrown, and there were some down branches from the hardwood trees.  Being pressed 4 time, only a few pictures and a short history lesson."

Also be sure to check out the small classes that they hold! We just attended a painting class (only once a year!) and came home with beautiful work, we had a great time and we are so excited for our next class!",

Now run by the state of Florida with a very low entrance fee to see the well maintained legacy he started.",

There was a concert going on by the garden so parking was full, but we were able to park up by the lake and they had a tram that we could take down to the Garden so we didn't have to walk all that way. Very well maintained and friendly staff.",

There's likely going to be more traffic to get to there and all the parking spaces will be taken by guests visiting it because in that area, the contractors and city officials do not like to add free parking for the tenants and their guests.

Of course, my son is young so he didn\u2019t care and still had fun but I thought if I\u2019m paying to play and drove an hour to get there, it should definitely be more playable.  We have played putt putt at a lot of different places and this was the dirtiest course we have ever played on.  Inside was okay, they obviously pay a lot better attention to the inside than out.  All and all, we still had fun so I would recommend but giving a heads up on what to expect.",

Still think they need more actual arcade games and less skill cranes/redemption games.",

   "It was fun.. We had age ranges from adults Down to 2 yrs of age and everyone enjoyed themselves. Only got 3 states due to cosmetics. The place really needs a scrubbing and some paint",
   "Fun Station is a good afternoon distraction, it could be filled out a bit. The attractions are decent. I particularly enjoyed the large laser tag arena with multiple levels and the go-karts were great. I think that the arcade could be filled out a bit. Over the last decade, arcade owners found that ticket games can be lucrative because they encouraged replay value, but the games themselves are hollow and lack depth. Fun Station falls into this trap. Maybe a balance of pinball and old-school arcade classics would encourage us dads to bring our younger ones in more often."

   "Love the Grove!! It's a beautiful hidden gem on Monroe street. The staff members who work there are so knowledgeable of the house and the land. The tours are also quite detailed and pays tribute to all aspects of the people who've lived and worked in the home. I love how they always showcase the history of the house and land with various activities for the whole family throughout the year such as their monthly Backyard Discovery program and Nature Walks. I will definitely be coming back again and again.",
   "Great little gem in the middle of Tallahassee, just north of downtown. The house is beautifully restored and full of local Florida history. Definitely a must see for museums. The gardens at the Grove are equally well kept and make for a peaceful walk.",
   "Today was ideal for the Nature Walk at the Grove! I had previously taken the house tour,but the behind the scenes tour of the property was very interesting.Our tour guide Jon ,was fabulously knowlegable.Recommended!",
   "Lovely and somewhat hidden gem in the middle of Tallahassee. The history of the house is impressive, loved the information panels, the \"on-the-hour\" tour was also nice. Very knowledgeable and friendly tour guide.",
   "Absolutely stunning, another jewel \ud83d\udc8e of Florida history. The garden features tons of Magnolia Trees and lots of beautiful flowers. A must see if visiting Tallahassee. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. I love that they've included a kids reading time as well. \n\nEnjoy my photos!!!"

It's all interesting but there is very little to do otherwise. Wish there was more signage to be able to take a hike around or follow a path. Everything is either fenced off or you're walking right on the road.",

Byrd told us it will be restored to  its originally designed plans.  Visitors may photograph the exterior only.",

Of course being able to hear wonderful stories about life and growing up in Spring House from Byrd makes it that much more amazing!  It is definitely worth working into you itinerary."

The playground is far enough from the road (& downhill) that I'm more at ease compared to other parks. It can get crowded depending the time of day because there is a daycare/school next door. My kids love having other kids to play with so it just depends what you want that day. Again it's not always crowded, so just be mindful of the school days & times.",

It's usually quiet and has lots of different paths you can take. They're all very different looking from one another (one has a lake, a large field, dense forest, and lots of steep hills). It feels like you're discovering new paths and mini ecosystems everytime you go. It's also excellent for dog walking.",

I miss how it used to look with the wooden playground structure, but the current one today seems to be enjoyed the kids. The nature trail is routinely maintained and well marked; it has a nice blend of not being too long or too short. Excellent for a runner like me who likes upward slopes, or if you prefer mostly flatland there is a loop around it. The creek at one part is a very lovely sight and can be fun to do some exploring around.  Sandwiched between Arbor Hills and and another neighborhood makes it a nice off the main road gem that's inhibited mostly by locals."

The swimming area is separate from the rest of the river, which is nice to keep the rest of the Springs from being damaged.\n\nThe hotel looks very cute from the outside. They also have boat tours, although I didn't check to see prices or other general information.\n\nI can tell that this place gets really full during the summer. The proximity to Tallahassee and FSU probably means lots of college-aged people. Not necessarily a bad thing, but something to keep in mind if that's not your scene.",

   "Fantastic birding.\nThe Rangers working the welcome center could NOT have been more helpful.\nAllot at least half a day to take your time, pull off the road, and hike a bit.\nIn fact this looked like a good park for bicycles.",
   "By visiting this beautiful wildlife refuge it brought back so many Wonderful childhood memories. As I was younger growing up in Tallahassee Florida we would love fishing with our Dad!! One of our familys favorite spots was St. Mark\u2019s lighthouse just because it had freshwater on one side as well as the ocean salt water on the other. I remember spending countless hours my brother and I catching pin-fish that my dad would Cut  in half and use for his bait hoping to catch even bigger fish and sometimes even sharks!! Over the years my dad had caught thousands of fish from this location including an alligator gar, a hammerhead shark and a smaller great white shark. We would walk out into the ocean as far as we could go without having water over our heads and fish all day long until nighttime - having to run to shore as the tide quickly came up along with the moon!!! There are many different picnic areas around and several different wildlife viewing spots. There are the most beautiful colored birds and even very large birds - the largest birds I\u2019ve ever seen. We\u2019ve seen bobcats as well as huge hairy fire-red ants and even An entire army of migrating crabs. Years ago  there used to be tons of alligators everywhere lounging in the sun.. My mom even wants tripped over a gator that was laying across the path to our truck. It was so long , it stretched over the entire width of the whole path. I will never forget that time. Unfortunately due to the new gator hunting season,  I never see any alligators at all anymore.. it\u2019s sad. Overall this is an amazing place!!",
   "This is an absolutely gorgeous place to be. The lighthouse is spectacular! So much to see and experience at St. Marks. If I came here daily I still could not get enough. I love this place!",
   "we went to see monarch butterfly festival and stopped by the light house which is 7 miles from the festival venue. we could see few monarch butterflies here. the place is good to spend some time. it was nice that they had free shuttle Van service from the parking. we liked the light house and the area surrounding it. it is definitely a must see if you go to St. Marks.",
   "I loved this spot for viewing wildlife and exploring as much as any place I have ever gone! Bring Misquote repellent! This is a Bucket list spot for anyone that enjoys the outdoors."

The lake is surrounded by trails which can be hiked in couple of hours. As fir the facility there is a restroom and a sitting area. There is a $3 fee to enter the park which can be wrapped in an envelope and dropped in a drop box near the entrance. Bring your food and water, because there's no vending machine inside the property.",
   "This park is the best park in the state of Florida. Great fishing and beautiful bluffs along the gorgeous banks of Lake Talquin. Not to mention the 1.1 mile trail that wonders through the pristine woods bordering awesome ravines with the lake as a background. Don't miss it.",
   "Beautiful park. Short boardwalk along the water.  Small fishing pier. Nice bathrooms, clean with soap and hand towels.  Huge pavilion and grill area that can be reserved.  There is a trail,  but we didn't venture - too hot, wet and  too many mosquitos!!!!",

   "What a great trail. We really enjoyed hiking through the park. Nobody else around that day, very peaceful with lots of deer tracks on the trail.",
   "Just the right amount of trails for an out and back day hike. Trails are sandy with most of it just plowed fire lines. It has the main trail with a few side loops for extra mileage. No bridge across the St. Marks River at the north side of the park, so unless there are drought conditions you can't cross without getting wet/muddy. You will likely be the only one hiking here!",
   "Great hike or bike. About 3 miles one way.  There are bears. Both times I visited I saw a momma bear and two Cubs (June 2019). They ran away but they do love in that area. \nAlso saw turkeys lots of deer and a few snakes and an owl and a small bird with an orange beek.",
   "This park is on former timber property that includes the upper Saint Marks River and a contributing tributary - Gum Creek. The area hosts many planted pines but otherwise is a really nice piece of property. Parts of the trail go through swampy areas closer to the creek (Gum Creek) and other parts go through higher ground. There are bay trees and large stands of native bamboo. The trail is at times former timber roads and at other times recently plowed trails. The footing is mostly sandy, swampy/damp or rough from ploughing/clearing. It seems like it might be difficult to use some of the trails in more wet conditions. I only walked the Yellow Blaze and southerly part of the Blue Blaze",
   "Great park for a bit of an adventure. Don't expect a gift shop, and wear ankle boots if possible. Lots of flooded areas and some creek and bog crossings on the yellow trail. Nonetheless this park is home to some beautiful scrub habitat, wetlands and teeming with birds, wildflowers and other creatures. Didn't see any bears unfortunately! In the summer I imagine heavy bug spray or even a face mosquito net is necessary."

I won't lie and say the seats are great, watching a two hour + movie in there will hurt your bum.  But I have only noticed while watching movies that edge three hours.  \n\nThey have kids programs here, a planetarium as well as other activities that are worth exploring if you are looking for things to do that won't kill the bank.",

Good place to fish year round with lotsa creeks that hold fish through the winter when water temps drop and fish leave the flats. You can see dolphins way back in the creeks too at high tide.

The eggs were cooked perfectly. Then for dessert he had ice cream, 1 scoop of vanilla and 1 scoop of chocolate malt. Both were made there.

Let\u2019s hope this review takes you to this hidden gem before a wait list is made to get in the door.

   "We had a wonderful dinner at Cypress. They have a valet outside if it gets really busy so it\u2019s very convenient. It was very close to our hotel and I saw the high ratings so we thought we give it a chance. The waiter was very professional and when asked which items he preferred, he gave us honest answers. We started with the pork cheeks appetizer which was sublime. It was so tender and delicious. We both got the hanger steak, which was perfectly seasoned and even had a little bit of a kick to it. The mashed potatoes were delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant.",
   "One of the cleanest and neatest restaurants I have been in Tallahassee. This is so important factor to me that I started my review with. I had mushroom \ud83c\udf44 soup \ud83e\udd63 which was delicious and I recommend it to those who like their soup creamy instead of watery. We had butter lobster \ud83e\udd9e and steak \ud83e\udd69 big dishes. Both very tasty! The service is good and staff are nice. Great place for special occasions!",
   "I only got to go there once.  I want to go again.  The only thing I did not like about it was the big scary trucks whizzing by on Tennessee Street,  LOL but that's not their fault.  I found the atmosphere cozy and warm and I recall our server being very attentive.  The scallops I had there were the best and I do mean the best scallops I've ever eaten,  bar none.  Kudos!",
   "What a wonderful place! Friendly staff, comfortable surroundings. I had a delicious red wine recommended by the staff with a delicious bowl of French onion soup.",
   "Went here to celebrate an occasion. Had heard about the renovations and thought it would be fun to visit and see the changes. To our disappointment, it really hasn't changed much and even worse, the quality of food has drastically declined. We won't be going back here for a very long time. Hope they are able to bounce back and make some major improvements so the quality of food served matches the prices they are charging."

   "Our favorite place to eat in Tallahassee...food choices vary frequently but they keep several of the staples on the menu such as the steak...my personable favorite, along with the lettuce wedge. Food is always fresh and made to order. They allow corkage for a reasonable charge of $10. No reservations taken so we try to arrive early so we don\u2019t have much of a wait. Service is good. We enjoy sitting at the bar to watch the cooking.",
   "Kool Beanz never fails to offer interesting and great tasting food. Every time I go back there are old favorites along with new delicious entrees. There is also a good wine list to compliment the food.",
   "Best fine dining in the capital city! Rotating menu but always something good on tap. Great seating, eccentric flavors and staff, a joy every time we come to Kool Beans. Get there early because they stay PACKED and parking can be limited in peak hours. Save room for the homemade desserts, you\u2019ll regret if you don\u2019t.",
   "Great food, helpful staff, cute atmosphere. There's a pretty big patio, but inside seating is limited. I would suggest making a reservation. There's an open kitchen so you can watch the magicians behind the counter cook your food. We probably ordered too much but everything on the menu looked amazing! \n\nBe aware that the menu changes daily, so if you're like me and prefer to thoroughly research before going somewhere, try to go in with an open mind. You won't regret it!!!",
   "Absolutely amazing!  I enjoyed my meal from the cafe style bar with a full view of the culinary artists preparing the food.  My meal and service were impressive, ambiance impeccable.  One of the best recommendations I've ever received.  Kudos to the team at Kool Beanz!"

   "We had such a beautiful mother and daughter group meal here. It\u2019s such a cool building and the food is fresh and delicious",
   "I love this place. I wish it was around when I went to college in Tallahassee. It's a very large restaurant but it's broken up in sections so it feels intimate. Very cozy. The bubble bread is to die for. Last time I was there I had one of the specials. I think it was some sort of mushroom ravioli delicious. Friend had the lasagna which is always a winner. Staff is young but very and know how to do their job well. There is a great bar for waiting for a table. They have very good house wine. it's family-oriented but also a great place to take dates or for anniversaries.  Always a thumbs up.",
   "Was invited here for a double. Fantastic, eclectic experience with world-class chefs producing delicious meals. This almost beats every other restaurant, is priced perfectly and even when packed\u2014has the capacity & service to deliver. We love this place for Italian Traditional, Seafood dishes, and dynamic salads.",
   "I love Bella Bella and eat there often. The ambiance, the food, the staff are always friendly, knowledgeable and efficient! When I eat there with friends, they ask me \"What's good here?\" and I always answer with confidence \"Everything!\"",
   "Great experience and a calm atmosphere. The servers are always attentive and polite. The portions fit the price, and while the menu is short, it offers a great deal of fresh variety. Many of the items are prepared unique to Bella Bella, so even dishes you have tried elsewhere may tingle your palate in a different way. Overall it was a wonderful experience, and we will definitely be returning in the future. (PS. Try the Bubble Bread, it is delicious and melty.)"

   "A friend and I visited on a Wednesday around 12:30 pm, during lunch rush.  The place was packed (always a good sign) and there was a short wait, but seating inside and out to sit while we waited.  The inside has a really great atmosphere, upscale casual, with many patrons wearing white collar business attire, and also intimate.  The lighting was dim, but not so much that it is hard to see what is being served.  The staff was pleasant and service was prompt.  My friend and I both ordered a burger, he tried the knife-and-fork and I got the Avalon.  I loved my burger!  The flavors of the arugula and cheeses were rich, but paired perfectly!  I would definitely order something different next time with faith that it would be equally delicious.  My friends burger was very good, especially if you like a little spice.  It was spicier than I expected but someone looking for a little giddy up with their meal would really enjoy this burger!  For two non-alcoholic drinks and two burger entrees, plus a 25 percent tip, the bill was about 50 dollars.  A little pricey to just satisfy a burger craving on a lunch break, but the service and ambiance was well worth it!  I'd highly recommend visiting this establishment and hope to do so again soon.",
   "We brought my in-laws family here last Sunday (Father's Day). The steaks were great. We ordered both beef and bison to compare the taste, flavor and texture. I like both. Bison was just a bit chewier than beef. One of my kids liked bison and the other preferred beef. My father in-laws thought bison was more flavorful and a bit sweeter than beef and he loved it. The Chili soup was one of the best. I like the fresh pickled cucumber but the rest of my family didn't. They didn't serve bread and butter at beginning and all of us preferred that way so we could enjoy the main meal better.",
   "Solid four.  Ted's is on the higher side of casual dining with an unpretentious vibe.   Sort of reminds me of places I've been out West, San Antonio so many years ago.  Jyes, bison's on the menu.  \n\nLove the space, the feeling.  Everyone was especially nice front to back.  Popped in this time for drinks and snacks so we sat at the bar ...all the way down unnecessarily for whatever reason open facing the line cooks, which was actually fun because they sort of indulged us with soft interest like sitting in with the chef.  Was fun.  Burger came to order spot on, good luck with that elsewhere.\n\nBeen in a number of times passing through town over the years, sort of look forward to it.  We need you in Orlando.",
   "follow up 3-4-20 - after an uncharacteristic  disappointing visit I was contacted by corporate and sent a gift card and invited back for another try.  First of all, that action speaks volumes about Ted's and their customer focus.  Went back yesterday and everything was wonderful.  Appetizers, entrees and dessert: presentation, portion, taste and temperature were spot on and our server Emmanuel was on his game: friendly, respectful, attentive and efficient.  We will be back for sure !!",
   "Delicious, home style food, great service, great atmosphere. Love the private booths. Never had a bad experience here. They've been around a while, clearly they have the recipe for success. If you haven't been, go! You won't regret it."

Midtown Caboose is open for carry out. Call or order online before you head over, and your order will be waiting, and will be brought out to you.\n Enjoy! Five stars all around!!!",
   "Good atmosphere. Server was friendly and fast. Tables, chairs, utensils and menus were clean. Food was good and plentiful. I came here with my significant other and for two drinks and two burgers and fries the total bill was 35$ but we were full! (The sweet potato fried had cinnamon sugar on them.)",
   "Visiting in town for work, it was suggested we try this burger place for the \"Mac Daddy\" it was awesome as was the \"Liberty Bell\" a Philly cheese steak on a cheeseburger with garlic fries. To say it was Great is not enough. It was the best cheeseburger I have ever had in my travels!!",
   "Midtown Caboose offers a wide variety of specialty sandwiches, burgers, wraps and salads. My first tip is if you are going to check them out for the first time read their menu online ahead of time. There are so many choose and flavor combinations it can be hard to narrow down your selection. Each of their creations has been perfectly crafted to create the best flavors. Take for instance their Shepard's Pie Burger. Everything you love about a Shepard's Pie morphed magically into a burger! This burger is very filling and because of the mashed potatoes on the burger I suggest opting out of the fries for another one of their great sides. The servers are fast and attentive. They also have a great outdoors seating area out back."

Table 23 is a consistent favorite of mine. If you enjoy pork, please try the 3 little pigs as it is so full of flavor and just great. Drinks are also great here too!",
   "All I had heard about this restaurant was positive. I decided to try this restaurant the other day. The fact is that we got there 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. I had a fried catfish and my partner had a salmon. The salmon was honestly yummy. However, I had the worst catfish in my life. The crust was too thick and too salty. After I removed the crust, I got two 2-inch pieces of fish. I was shocked by the fact that the chef used very tiny portions of the fish to serve us. And, how he could make the crust that salty and thick. Not to mention that half of the fish was not cooked at all. The atmosphere, wait staff and everything else was great. Just don't go there anytime close to their closing business hour."

The fish is perfectly cooked and nestled on a bed of whipped potatoes and amply covered with crab meat. Fresh pecans surround the plate and a stack of sweet potato ribbons tops it off. All of the flavors blend nicely together with the excellent sauce that is never too much, however has a bit of a bite.

(no bar) Reasonable prices. \n\nDon't let the pizza hut exterior fool you... Great place for a good dinner!",
   "The conch here is amazing. It was very tender.I was given rice and mac and cheese. The owner left me Try the mac and cheese and it was amazing. It's considered Bahamian style Mack and cheese. It's well seasoned. It's not the typical mac and cheese. The owner actually cooks the food, which is very good. The inside of the restaurant is set up like it's still in bananas.",

Creme brulee was good! I'm just not blown away.  Although if I had to return with no other options, I would. Hard sell for me.",

   "To be honest this was a very different type of restaurant. They have amazing drinks by far.. In house beer, wine, liquor and more. I think that the menu might have been a bit pricey for the type of food that they were serving. Extremely Innovative but just different, for example the appetizer of the avocado egg rolls was very interesting. The pizza is always a great choice nothing like having brussel sprouts and asparagus on your pizza!! As always the sandwich was delicious so I do plan on coming back to this place mostly because of desert. which was a huge baked cookie and ice cream on top!!!!",
   "Truly disappointed. Ordered online and picked it up. Just got a salad but they put cheese on it when I customized the order and made sure cheese was taken out. Portion size was very small. I eat in the store all the time and I order the same salad: take out was 3x smaller and I paid $17 for it. Very disappointed and I will never order take out again."

   "Stopped in for lunch - the burgers were awesome and HUGE! I had the Lip Smacker with a side of pasta salad. Absolutely delicious. They have a patio area in the back that is shaded with picnic tables and tables with umbrellas. Highly recommend this place to anyone wanting amazing food in a fun, laid back environment.",
   "This used to be my hands down favorite restaurant in town but ever since they reopened its been a disappointment. They halved the size of the menu, but more importantly they reduced the quality of the food. The burgers used to be big and like 1.5\u201d thick and now they are about half that size, and they switched from real cheese to what appears to be Kraft slices (really??). The prices however are the same, why would I pay $13 for a burger the same quality as a $6 one at relish down the street? They also changed the inside, it used to be kinda cool and cozy inside with old wood tables and dark red paint, but know it feels like I\u2019m in a psychiatric ward as they painted it off-white and replaced the wood tables with cheap plastic ones. I really don\u2019t know why they changed the place everyone liked it before, I hope they return to their old menu and ingredients before people stop coming back.",
   "Wonderful place. The burgers are amazing, the option of being able to build your own burger is quite cool. The range of options can be intimidating but it's super fun to do. The staff are also quite  helpful. Also they have a 25% discount for FSU/DAMU/TCC students who have a valid id! Definitely recommend it.",
   "I was so excited for them to reopen, but am saddened by the changes. They downsized the menu, downsized the burger weight by 60-70%, and kept the prices the same or increased them. I had been a loyal customer for over a year, but I don't think I'll be returning. The only upside is their fries are still great.",
   "Good food with a lot of options. They are quick and food tastes good each time! Fair prices. Good parking each time. The place is actually bigger than it looks. There is large backroom with TVs. They mostly have sports on. Servers are students but they are quick and nice. Most importantly food is very fresh. They have the best sweet potato fries in town. Just give it a shot and you will not regret."

   "My husband took me to Georgio's tonight for a quiet celebration of my birthday. It was just our second time there, the first being his job's Christmas party. Like the first time, the food and service were absolutely amazing!! He had the Delmonico steak and I had the Shrimp Scampi, and both were superb! I had a piece of Chocolate Mousse cake for my birthday cake and it was was heavenly. Nicole was a friendly & attentive server, and, of course, we were greeted by the owner when we came in. I'm already looking forward to the next time we done there!",
   "The absolute worst experience ever at a fine dining restaurant. Me and my family have eaten here on many occasions and just recently decided to order online. I ordered over $85 in food only for my driver to arrive and the bartender be rude and non professional about the order I know was placed! I was on the phone with my driver listening how rude he was. Sad to say me and family will NOT be back and I will review throughout....On another note my driver was extremely professional and all around great.",
   "The Delmonico steak was seasoned very well and cooked to the requested temperature. My server, Taylor, was fantastic and recommended a glass of Malbec to accompany my meal, which was delicious! Taylor helped to create a great meal. The owner, Georgio checked on me a couple of times as well. You will not regret a visit!",
   "Great experience at this restaurant!  The grouper fingers, ribeye and carrot cake were all delicious and fresh! Brian, the bartender, went above and beyond to educate us on the menu and its offerings!  I will be back!",
   "Classy but not overdone restaurant and lounge that pulls off being kind if homey.  The wait staff were very attentive and friendly.  The food was high quality and presented well.  Prices were a bit high, but not out of character for the area.  This would be a great spot for a gathering if you have a group - I saw several groups enjoying themselves.  It also had some quieter more private booths which would be ideal for a romantic dinner.  I chose from the specials menu, a beef bourgeois pot pie - delicious and perfect!"

   "ALWAYS fresh food and superior service. Their salsa (both hot and mild) us delicious. They also have plenty of vegetarian options and do not use lard. Great for lunch, dinner, or brunch!",
   "2 stars for food and 5 stars for customer service. Ordered fish tacos and shrimp tacos, both were bland and the salsa tasted candy sweet. It was interesting. Food is overpriced. The service was great though. Servers were attentive and friendly.",
   "My family loves coming here! I am a pescatarian and there are so many food options for me here. The customer service is amazing, and everyone is so sweet. Also the decorations with surf boards, and photos throughout the years give such happy, wholesome vibes! I ordered a vegetarian black bean burger and it was the best i have ever had! I wish I could give a higher review!",
   "Service is what we came to expect (good, professional and nice). If you want a great all American hamburger, go to Cabo\u2019s. If you are not really hungry, order the 1/4 pounder. But the 1/2 pounder is A LOT. The French Fries are so good. My spouse and mother love the chicken tacos. I\u2019ve eaten the beef tacos and they are great to."

   "As a Virginia (coastal) native, I\u2019ve literally never had better sushi in my life. The quality of the fish is very apparent upon eating it initially, and the leftovers are almost nearly as fresh and inviting as the original product. Overall one of the best restaurants I\u2019ve ever had the fortune of dining from, 10/10 would definitely recommend.",
   "This Benihana has been the most consistent and convenient out of all the locations I've visited down here. Parking is easy, food is consistently good as well as the chefs and servers. One thing I would suggest is making a reservation. Walk-in times can be pretty long for dinner.",
   "Great job! Good was served Hot and fresh, Great customer service. Love the Reno!",
   "First time trying the Seafood Fried Rice was very good.  I was excited to return with a friend.  Second time, not so good.  The shrimp, salmon, and scallops have a light coating of something, maybe cornstarch, which is unique, however this time, the seafood just tastes...  wet.  Like it was previously frozen and just barely heated?  I don't know, but we'll probably stick with our favorite place: Kiku.",
   "Haven't eaten here in over 10 years. The first time I ate here the food was wonderful. But I ordered food last night for me and my husband, it was my husband's first time trying this restaurant. But the food was horrible the food tasted burnt the beans that they put on my general chicken was burnt there was so much sauce on it you can not even taste the chicken."

   "I have been going to Sahara for years, but then somehow hadn't gone since their move until today. Hubby took me for lunch, and wow was it delicious! I had the gyro wrap (add feta), and it was absolutely amazing. I marveled over it multiple times. I was also impressed with the amount of nice, thick-cut meat on the wrap. It's not some dinky little wrap, this thing is full & hearty! My husband got the beef shawarma (add feta), which has french fries in it, and wow that was really tasty as well. The flavors of the 2 wraps were completely different, but both equally yummy. I will definitely be back again soon, and not let so much time pass again before returning! Two thumbs up for sure!",
   "Amazing authentic middle eastern food! Went there for a business dinner and their staff was very helpful and attentive. The food is delicious. We ordered 5 different plates and were not disappointed. There is a lot of food competition in this area, you can\u2019t go wrong with this choice.",
   "It wasn\u2019t awful but they were out of Greek Salad and service was real slow initially. There was a lot of meat but the food tasted just meh.

It's nothing fancy but the food is divine. The homemade cocktail sauce is practically worth the trip. I can't resist the oysters on the half shell or the seafood platter.",
   "This place is the very best for fresh shucked oysters, seafood and the best home-made slaw ever!",
   "The BEST oysters and fried shrimp in town.  LOVE this place.  Have been eating at Shell for 20+ years and have NEVER been disappointed.  Great family owned business",
   "Great food. Great service.  Great atmosphere. The very best raw oysters and fresh fried local seafood. Best by far in Tallahassee. No other seafood compares in Tallahassee.",
   "This place is a hidden gem in Tallahassee. The food is amazing! I visit during lunch and am in the door as soon as they open as the place is small and they fill up fast! Once you\u2019ve had their nuked oysters, you\u2019ll see why. As you\u2019re walking in, the waiters are taking your orders and by the time you\u2019re seated, you have drinks and apps served. This place moves fast. But you don\u2019t feel rushed. Everyone is super friendly. Don\u2019t come in expecting fine dining. Your food is served in reusable baskets, with packaged silverware and paper cups. But who cares when you\u2019re being served fresh, hot seafood and great sides! The only downside is that they are CASH ONLY which can be a bit inconvenient for those of us who rarely carry cash. Other than that, I have no complaints. Love this place!"

   "I went on Monday for the ALL YOU CAN EAT crab and it was simple but great. Service was excellent. It wasn't like some restaurants where they have you wait between refills, rather they replace your crab before you even finish. They keep you topped off. Crab is well cooked with Old Bay and is brought to the table hot. You can get light, medium, or heavy seasoning. I recommend lessening the seasoning as your feast goes on. I also tried the Mac and Cheese because other reviews recommended it, and it was also delicious. Reminded me of a sharply flavored pub cheese dipping sauce. They encourage you to get your money's worth and more. I will definitely be back.",

What more could we ask for.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe",
   "This is a really good seafood restaurant for someplace not on the coast. Fried shrimp were excellent and the fries are delicious. I had the seafood jambalaya and it was excellent. It had just the right kick and lots of seafood. Very surprised to find this quality seafood inland away from the coast. We have also eaten at their Gainesville restaurant and both are worth trying.",
   "I recently took my family here for a seafood feast. The appetizers were great (gator tail and calamari). We got mixtures of boils and fried fish. The fried items we're done right with minimal breading and weren't greasy. It was all tasty. My only criticism is that you should consider adding more higher end beer options.",
   "Wow this place is awesome! On our way to Tampa we found this place and turned out to be one of our beat experiences in this trip. We ordered crab which was great and well marinated. The house made burger was a class upper than what I\u2019ve hd so far. If it happens to go to Tallahassee make sure you visit this place."

Prices are a little pricey, but well worth it when you consider the owner buys things fresh and curates these recipes herself. She will come out and greet you and ask how your meal was. The Kings river may be one of the best meals I've ever had. One word of caution: spice is no joke here. If you can't handle spicy, be sure you get the lowest spice setting. Hot pushes it and Thai hot is even more intense.",
   "Atmosphere, service, and food was superlative. Pad Thai with extra chili sauce was amazing. Bangkok Chicken was perfectly prepared. We will definitely return.",
   "We could see this place being amazing. The coconut broth shrimp soup was great!!! The two entree specials we ordered (red snapper, and duck) had great sauce, plenty of good veggies but the meat on both dishes where over cooked. The fish was dry and duck was not what it could have been. We will definitely come back to try more soups, ice cream, and the curry dishes. \nSoups are great here!!!!\nFriendly staff and nice atmosphere."

   "Excellent food, great service, wonderful drink selection. The only con was the noise. Hard floors and a black brick wall just bounce sounds everywhere, so there was just a lot of ambient noise. Not enough to keep you away, but enough to make you have to be in the mood to cope with it. I'd still go back - definitely worth it.",
   "Delicious creative food combinations that taste a little different with every bite. The atmosphere was relaxing, soft lighting sets the mood. I didn't partake in the alcohol options but the menu of mixed drinks was extensive and creative. A must try is the butternut squash cheesecake.",
   "I like this place,  service can be slow depending on where you sit, but I keep going back for the food!! I was literally blown away by the steak frites... I mean... WHOA. The flavor kept exploding in my mouth with every bite! Other options on the menu have not disappointed either.  Don't miss your chance to try this place,  even if you're not there to drink.",
   "Liberty has a good happy hour and a cozy atmosphere. I'd recommend it for dates, a fancy dinner with friends or even just a drink after work. Parking can be tight at times, but you can usually find a spot in the lot or across the street."

We ordered happy hour drinks ( Friday till 7pm ) all our drinks were very good. \nWe both ordered off the night specials my wife got the brazed short rib and it was simply amazing, I ordered the dry aged Kansas strip and for the cost it is one of the best meals I have had.\nI have to say this was a great value for an evening out and we will be back.",

I opted for grits instead of the potatoes and think that was a better choice. Expect to spend some time here if you go on a Sunday; it's supposed to be leisurely.  All in all, a great experience.",

My wife had the Blu Halo pork chop (2 bone chop) covered in a blueberry compote, goat cheese, with mashed potatoes. I had the Southern Grouper (blackened) with southern style collard greens, and thick, creamy grits. The service and food was wonderful. We will be back.",

Great steak, Great Cut, Cooked perfectly, our preference is wood fires with no coffee.\nWill return and recommend. Thanks",
   "The pickled Bloody Mary is to die for as I LOVE  spicy any day!  Had the eggs, bacon and house potatoes which were all cooked to perfection!!!  \n\nWe had a party of 8 and they allowed us to enjoy almost 2-1/2 hours dining with them. Great ambience and fabulous hosts!!  Would visit again next time I am in Tally!!!!"

I asked if the Italian sausage was sweet or hot, and since he wasn't sure, he offered to ask the chef. The chef prepared some for me to try so I could decide whether to order the Fettuccine Alfredo with the sausage or chicken. The sausage was great with the pasta, as were the rolls with Parmesan cheese topping and salad. I'd go back often if I lived in the area.",

It is a small family run place with all the classic dishes you love and crave.\n\nI had the baked meat lovers spaghetti, which was huge and delicious. One of our kids had the baby pizza and it was big enough to be filling with a great crispy crust.\n\nTheir meat sauce is unbelievably good and so it their house dressing. I wish there was a place like this where I live.",

A bit on the expensive side, we normally each get half orders of the pasta and then split a steak. Make sure to make a reservation! It can be hard to get a seat. This restaurant is popular with University fundraisers and legislative folks.",

   "After hearing about this place all day, we were excited to experience the \u201cbest restaurant in Tallahassee.\u201d Unfortunately, our experience was not along those lines. Our reservation for for a kitchen view table, but the window to the kitchen was in no way a kitchen view. Our head waiter treated the assistant waiter terribly, snapping his fingers and making noises to get her attention. The som broke the cork in our bottle of wine, took the bottle to the back and returned with the open bottle, no cork and poured a tasting that had cork in the wine. We filled our wine glasses ourselves the rest of the night even while then waiter and som cleared our plates with empty glasses. The food was decent, but not consistent with the prices being charged. Just a weird experience for a restaurant billed as #1 in the city. Would not return again."

Also loved all the service patches from all over.",

We were initially greeted by the awesome decor of the place.  Very patriotic and nostalgic!  I spent ten minutes just looking at photos that were hanging on the walls. Then we ordered our meal. We split a three-meat sampler.  We got the brisket, pulled pork, and cheese jalapeno sausage.  Sides were mac-n-cheese and bacon green beans.  Everything was perfect!  The pulled pork was juicy, brisket rub was great and the sausage was addictive!  To top off a great meal, the friendliness of the employees was very welcoming!  The sent us off with a free pen and beer koozie.  What a great meal and experience!  We'll be back!",

   "Solid four something quasi-commercial BBQ.\n\nSomehow ended up with the kids meal rib deal and a beer Lol but Loved it.  Awesome.  All the flavors were really very good and the portions are fair enough.\n\nI'm from the land of 4 Rivers and while I know there's one in Tally, I'm always looking over the fence for good barbecue somewhere else.  Sides were spectacular.  Sauces, mnmmm... but sauces are subjective.  As with the brisket, which was nice and moist but more like pot roast and fattier than should be for me.  Well portioned (as far as brisket goes) and delicious after saucing up but I prefer smoked brisket so that's off the menu for me.\n\nDefinitely solid repeatable barbecue."

Rice medley is definitely the move, we also got the beef which was awesome.  \n\nYou get some serious bang for your buck, unlimited tea and coffee, soups, and side salads with every meal. \n\nNot a spot you want to kick back in for a long time, but for a hole in the wall spot it\u2019s pretty killer.",
   "Looks small, but this little gem is priceless. Spectacular food, with many side dishes. Friendly and cozy atmosphere. 10/10, would recommend."

   "Made the trip from Albany to try some Vegan eats. Upon entering the place was clean, well lit, and organized. The cashier was somewhat friendly. I grabbed a little of everything off the menu and two of every sweet so I can try it all and it felt as though once my purchase was over 80 bucks the cashier seemed friendlier. Food is pretty good and sweets are even better.",

I\u2019ll be back sooner than later.",
   "I don't remember the name of that dish BUT it is rather exotic in presentation and tasty.   This is veggie restaurant.  A local favorite.",
   "A local favorite. I must have been at least a dozen times. Quick service, reasonable prices, and a solid menu. They have expanded it over time as certain specials have become staple menu options. Hard to beat the Tempeh Reuben but the buffalo tofu sandwich and burger are close seconds. They also source locally, organically, and fair trade, not to mention they recycle and compost. This place is a gem.\n\nPictured is a special they had: Texas Burger with onion rings.",
   "There isn\u2019t anything on this menu I wouldn\u2019t recommend. Well thought out and delicious dishes. \nWe ordered the Big Salad, the Biscuits and Gravy, coffee and a Cinnamon Bun. The portions are large and very satisfying. Every time I visit Tallahassee, I make this a must stop! \nLittle to no waste as well :)"

   "This place was really good and the pricing wasn\u2019t horrible. We stopped here on a road trip for breakfast. I got a buffalo chicken tender sandwich (I know it\u2019s a weird choice for breakfast but it sounded good) and it was only 9.99. It also came with breakfast potatoes. The meal was filling and tasty. Two people in my party got omelets, one person got a \u201ctrainers breakfast\u201d which consisted of seasoned egg whites and fruit, and one person got a salmon BLT wrap. She said the BLT was delicious and she highly recommends it. The service was pretty good and the waiter was fast to get drink refills and whatever else we needed. The atmosphere is pretty cool and modern. Overall, it\u2019s a fun, clean place with a great variety of food for everyone.",
   "Great brunch experience!  It was my first time going to The Egg and I enjoyed myself. The food was delicious, prompt friendly service and they had a beautiful venue space. \n\nFood ordered:\nThe Ultimate Seafood Omelette\nCinnamon Roll French Toast \n\nThis is a nice place for Breakfast, Brunch, or Lunch with things to choose from that will not be disappointed. Give them a try and stop by!!!",
   "My spouse and I ate brunch on a Sunday and both had a difficult time choosing our meal because there were so many dishes that looked great. We decided on The Yellow Bird and a quiche with shrimp and both were delicious. Like next level delicious. Our server, Cody, was very attentive and refilled our coffee frequently. Highly recommended for breakfast!",
   "We had a great experience on a Sunday morning. My boyfriend wanted a mimosa, so we went here! They have a very expansive menu so it took a while to order but our waitress was patient and answered all of our questions. They have plenty of options as well as specials, which were different quiches that day. We both got potato skillets which were good. The chicken that was in my boyfriends was unseasoned though, which would have been a total downer if he didn't have bacon in it as well. The only other downside was that after paying we didn't see anyone for a long time so it took forever to get a to-go cup. We will be back though for sure!",
   "The pics were beautiful but the food unfortunately didn't have really any taste. We were all unsatisfied leaving. Just not for us. Staff was friendly, food just not tasting great."

The food was great, the service was good and the environment was wonderful. On our grading scale of 1-10:\nAppetizer Wings 8\nRibeye steak 9\nLiquor/Bar 10\nLobster 7\nSalmon 9\nVeggies/sides 10\nRestroom 9\nCome here for a great time with friends and family!",
   "I went here four times, three of times were miserable experiences, the most recent time was better because I had a good waiter. He was very friendly, constantly refilled my soda and gave me one to go, and made himself known with the usual customers. Based on him alone this place would get 5 stars but other factors will make me avoid this place in the future. \n\nThe last time I guessed other waiter sat a family in a location were supposed to have a large group, so to fit this group of 20 they moved this small family's table inches from my booth. The father and young son were fine, the other individual was rude, cursing, and took his shoes off in front of me eating. And he used my table as his own storage place, he kept placing menus, dropped utensils, and his stuff on my table where my food was. A waitress saw this and removed the menus but didn't address anything else. \n\nPrevious times I got periods of no service. For one lunch it took them almost an hour to bring my food and never refilled my friend, then after that long wait keep pestering me if I wanted the check, rushing me to go after I waited so long for food, they didn't even bring bread. \n\nWorst was the time I ordered salad for lunch, that brought my bread then no salad or refills for 50 mins, I kept asking but my waitress was not around. At the hour mark after ordering my salad and it didn't show up I got up and left for the buffet across the street.",
   "Appetizers are good. Steak is awesome but felt little hard hard on the rib eye.. Good Service and will be back.",
   "I placed an online order for food at 4:15pm. I am pregnant and my 6-year-old was sick at home, so I wanted to pick up something tasty on my drive home from work. Online, it said that my order would be ready in 30 minutes. I arrived around 4:35pm and they said it would be a few minutes. A long line formed at the take out counter and no one seemed to be looking to see whether my food was ready or not. I got back in line and checked in again around 5:00. They said my food was not ready yet. At about 5:20pm, they told me that my food was coming out. Waited in line again in order to pick it up, but I was missing bread, butter, dipping sauce for the appetizer, my soup for my dinner, a drink, and the ice cream was half melted. The take out person went and gathered everything that was missing and even switched out the ice cream for me. Then, told me that they are out of bread (which I ordered with my order at 4:15 online) and that I could wait for bread. At 5:35, I finally had all my food. Also, there was no comfortable place to sit (I am pregnant) to wait. My choices were a bench with no back or a high stool with a small seat. I cannot believe that my food took over an hour to make. I will not be coming back to this Longhorn.",
   "LongHorn Steakhouse provides a quality dining experience.  The menu offerings do not end with just excellent steaks.  There are many delicious options for side items.  Additionally, it would be worthwhile to check for any seasonal specials throughout the year.  These selections - also - are quite appealing. \n\nRalph Hadley"

   "Door service was awesome. My husband and I had no where to eat while in Tallahassee yesterday except our truck. We saw Tan's and ordered at the door, where menus were provided. Only waited 10 minutes for our order. Customer service was excellent. Asked if we could sit at one of their outside tables to eat. Was told, \"Yes, and if you need anything, please let me know!\"  (Great lunch portion sizes too!) My meal was good but my husband wasn't as happy with his, but we had no idea what we were ordering!  That's why only  4 Star. We will definitely go back here, kindness goes a long way for us! BTW, thank you for being kind to us, for providing us and providing menus to your customers. We can tell you care!  Barbie",
   "I work right by this place, so I stop here for lunch pretty often. The food is fresh, it is well flavored. The Thai soup is amazing! the Mongolian tofu is the best tofu you will ever eat! I highly recommend this place, and it doesn\u2019t have MSG like a lot of other Chinese restaurants. (No MSG bloat) It is more towards the Thai flavoring with being run by Indonesians. Try it out!",
   "Staff exceptionally friendly. Food was outstanding. Small buffet but huge selection. Wide variety. Got take out a few times and thought it was great so we tried the buffet. By far the best buffet in town hands down. Spicy sections actually had some heat to them. A few things I've never had before and some old favorites. Great spring rolls and egg rolls. Certainly our new favorite  Lunch spot.",
   "We've all been to dozens, or more, Chinese buffets. You come to accept the averagness of food. Welcome to Tans, a fresh, not frozen, deluxe buffet! This joint even has some homemade curries that are amazing. The salt and pepper shrimp, yes this is on buffet, are huge, fresh and delicious. Skip all the rest and eat at the best!",
   "I loved the food here! \nI decided to try some items off their Indonesian menu just because I have never tried Indonesian before. I had the Beef in coconut milk with Balinese sauce and it was so good. Normally, I would take home left overs but I overstuffed myself on the food. I also had a stuffed Tofu appetizer. That was also pretty good. I liked the contrast in texture. You had this super crispy outside with the Tofu inside, which is creamy then the vegetables in the middle. The sauce just rounded it out as well. The spice level was very chill and just brought flavor to the dish as opposed to heat, which is always appreciated when I am trying something for the first.\nPrice was very reasonable for quantity and quality received as well.\nHighly recommended!!"

   "Whenever we fly into Tallahassee, this tends to be the first stop after the airport since we live in a landlocked state and want GOOD seafood. The range and selection of seafood -- both Southern and Vietnamese -- is outstanding. The fried okra is the best I have ever had. The manager and staff are attentive. The facility is always clean, casual, and timely for a quick lunch or stop on the way back to the airport.",
   "The Red Snapper is as good as the reviews said . Fresh tasty food and friendly service.They have a huge menu with all the seafood you could want and tons of Asian  inspired dishes, I am pretty sure it is mostly  vietnamese, my wife really enjoyed the Pho. \n    We did get the garlic shrimp to go one time and by the time we got it home it was just so so. Basically  I recommend eating in for best taste.",
   "A Tallahassee gem. The food is amazing and the service is fantastic. The food offered is either Vietnamese or Seafood. I have been here several times and have never had a bad experience. The owners are a couple - the wife does the cooking and the husband mans the front (taking orders, serving food, buses tables, etc.). I always enjoy the small talk I have with the husband because he's super friendly.\n\nIf you need a recommendation on what to try for the Vietnamese food, I HIGHLY recommend their beef stew - it's out of this world. There's just so much flavor packed into it and it smells divine. \nI'm also not from the South, but shrimp and grits have become a new favorite classic Southern dish. If you get some here, they drizzle it with this garlic butter sauce that makes my mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nI'm conflicted with spreading the word about this restaurant because I enjoy it being my little secret, but I want them to stay in business because I just adore this place so much. Anyway, just try the food here - you will not be disappointed.",

VeneBites is quite the opposite: real arepas made with passion and flavorful fillings that are to die for. Their other small bite offerings are also worth checking out.

   "Pretty cool spot in College Town.  Nice space.  Good atmosphere.  Saw they have a really good assortment of beers, bottles, and craft draft too.  All good things.\n\nOtherwise, underwhelming given all the reviews, pictures, and price point.  Just wasn't feeling it.  Maybe it was the traffic or the hassle of finding metered parking or general awkwardness of the front of house, I don't know.  \n\nArugula salad was nice enough but the Rustica pizza wasn't special like we thought it'd be.  Disappointing really, given the hype, that it came out under done, shy of basil, and with unappealing eggplant.  Seemed par cooked and heated up after the toppings went on just to warm things up.  Wasn't like you'd think it'd be coming out of that hot oven.  ...after digging through some other reviews, I see this comes up with them.  Probably should have ordered it \"extra done\" or \"medium well\" with an extra five seconds cook time, like another reviewer tipped.  \n\nDefinitely A-OK but whatever's special about them was lost on me.",

You have different options, you can choose the pizzas from the menu or you can customize your own pizza. Everything was good, also the cheesecake, the only problem was that there was a little bit of must on the cheese (I said it to the waiter).",

A creative sushi chef is always exploring new ways to combine flavors, colors and textures, while at the same time respecting the respecting the ancient traditions of sushi making.

   "Loved The Bark! Food was great and service was quick and friendly. Parking is out back and on side street. You order at the counter and you can pick some games from the corner to play while you wait for your food to be brought to you. There's bins you put your dishes in when your done. There is outdoor seating and you they have free pool to play as well. No kid menu but my daughter enjoyed the herb roasted potatoes( home-fries) and watermelon. Would highly recommend to anyone!",
   "Vegetarian restaurant with vegan and gluten free options. Very tasty, flavorful menu choices with daily specials. Casual atmosphere. Friendly, pleasant service. Order at the counter, eat inside or out. Formerly Bread and Roses Kitchen (when located around the corner on RR street). Really good food. Actual drinking glasses and utensils (not disposables) add to the pleasure!",
   "The staff and food here is always above average and have never let me down. I know coming BARK will leave me full and satisfied. Highly recommend.",
   "The atmosphere here is incredible, the decor is fun, and the staff are super nice. I went for karaoke night and had a blast! Everybody gets a chance to sing, even if they show up a bit later. Definitely have to try the peanut butter pie if you get the chance!",
   "We had been hearing about this great local place to try from our local farmers at Handsome Harvest since we're vegan, so we finally got a chance to try it out, loved it! Nice people, great food, fun atmosphere and awesome artwork. We're already looking forward to going back!"

   "Good prices, great staff! Amazing place to watch the super bowl but kinda wish they would make the food a little better. More chicken then bread next time please. Other than that it's a great place to come have some beers and food",
   "This place is phonemmonal, our waitress was attentive and caring. The food was divine, very spacious and comfortable atmosphere.  Will visit again when we return to Tallahassee \u2764",
   "I went here for the first time today with a friend. I have wanted tacos for so long, and Tin Lizzy's Cantina fully satisfied my craving! I had the mahi mahi taco, and it tasted so much better than I expected (I don't normally eat fish, but I have been trying new foods recently). I don't like slaw, but whatever their slaw is made from tasted really good. The service was good, and after we had paid, someone who seemed like the owner came up to ask how we had enjoyed the meal, and informed us that on Tuesdays they have tacos for cheaper prices. I will definitely be going back!",
   "Love this place! The food and atmosphere is great, as well as the taco Tuesday deals. The servers are all well trained and friendly and Bailey is super great!",
   "Meh. \n\nI've been here 3 times now. Each time we had slow service, which is particular annoying because you have to pay to park for each hour. With this bottleneck of time, they should really keep each table in and out under an hour, but this has NEVER happened for me. Which means you run the risk of getting a ticket, or you need to pay for 2 hours. \n\nAs for the food, it is only ever worth it on Taco Tuesdays, otherwise it is a bit pricey, probably just for the sake of being in college town. But as for choices in college town, it's semi-decent. Also, the chicken tortilla soup isn't creamy, which is kinda lame."

   "We have eaten several times, particularly after church on Sunday, and have been very pleased with the quality of food and service. Since it had been several weeks since we had been back we tried it this past weekend and was surprised that they offered a full buffet plus several Sushi offerings. This is not your normal buffet, the food was fresh, high quality and very tasteful. The Sushi offerings provided about 10-12 different versions. The pricing was incredible . This is one of several restaurants at Bannerman's Crossing, which is quickly becoming a foodies paradise with all the great restaurants.",
   "Great environment and the staff was pleasant. Maria did an excellent job serving. 10-2:30 buffet on Sunday. Very kid friendly. Food was great & fortune cookies.",
   "Amazing sushi. Chef Jose is a true artist. Nice atmosphere. Friendly service. A must try.",
   "We actually ended up at Dao by mistake but I\u2019m so happy with how it worked out. Our waitress was so sweet and helpful. The food is well priced and tasty. Unbeknownst to us we arrived during happy hour so the drinks were on sale too. We\u2019re definitely going back! *get the Sangria!*",
   "This is one of the worst meals Ive ever had bar none.  They should've spent more money on paying for good chefs rather than on their fancy locale.  Word of mouth about a hidden away place is fabulous advertising.\n\nCant believe ANYONE wrote up a good review about this greasy spoon in disguise! Their taste  must be in their foot!"

   "We ordered the Hall of Fame Family Pack last night. It clearly states you get a pitcher of Margaritas or a 6-pack of beer with it. We also spoke to friends who ordered this and received the alcohol. Well last night they changed there rules and charged us more $65 and did not give us any choice of alcohol. Do not believe what is posted for the family packs. We will not be going back even though we like the wings.",
   "I recently had my first experience going to Island swing Company and I absolutely loved the atmosphere! My coworkers were throwing a surprise party for my boss and so we reserved one of the fire pit tables out on the patio and there were quite a few of us but there was more than enough room for us all with those long wicker type benches. I ordered a frozen mango margarita and it was definitely in the top 4 best I\u2019ve had! And the serving sizes of their food was enough to share with 3 other people, so you definitely get more than you pay for! I definitely will be returning.",
   "Fantastic food! Wonderful flavors and huge portions! The staff is more than attentive. We have been taken care of by 3 wonderful staff members! Thank you Alli, Whitney and Cameron for making this a great first visit! Won't  be out last! Thanks to Gavin at Mattress Firm for recommending this great place!",
   "Everything was so delicious and the service was excellent. I'm not sure what my friends ordered for a shared plate, but the chicken wings sauce was pretty spicy - utterly delicious! You can tell it's great as it was full of people and all kinds of people were coming through the door. Definitely worth a visit!",
   "First time going there and would definitely go back. Wish there was one of these in Nashville! Love how everything is baked here rather than fried (their main theme). Food was great. Large selection on menu. Our server was pretty informative and allowed us to try our sauces for wings before deciding which flavor. Cameron was really awesome! Clean bathrooms. Would definitely recommend."

   "Excellent food and service. Katie, our bartender was awesome. The mac n\u2019 cheese bites were such a good app to share. The chicken wings were very good. The owner/GM Mike came by to check on us. We arrived at happy hour. Great happy hour prices 4-7. We will be back to try the rest of the food which looks so good. Recommend if you're in Tally. (good for old people too).",
   "I ordered the Ma's meat loaf and it did not disappoint! It had a sweet and spicy ketchup sauce on top, then crunchy bacon. So delicious! Huge portions, as well. My husband got the salmon. It was tasty, but needed more seasoning. Will def come back!",
   "Big portions, cool atmosphere, killer food. A little pricey but What more could you want? Try the fried shrimp with that awesome sauce, the Mac and cheese burger, or the meat loaf sandwich. Never disappointed.",
   "Our kids, who go to FSU, recommended this restaurant when we visited with them recently. Although we enjoyed the atmosphere, the food left much to be desired; the service was better than the food, but not much better. we started with an appetizer of cheese fries and although the quantity was very large there was only cheese on the top layer of fries and it did not come with any dipping sauce. After asking for ranch, it took at least 10 to 15 minutes for us to acquire any.  Our waitress was very good about refilling our water,  however. My daughter enjoyed her meal the most...chicken tenders, onion rings and fried Mac and cheese bites. I do NOT recommend the fish and chips, that was the special for tonight. The fish was really soggy and I couldn't eat it. My husband warned everyone not to get the veggie burger. He did not like it at all. My son got the bash burger and really enjoyed it.  The side salad was large, but not very tasty. Although the restaurant looks nice and has a nice atmosphere I would be in no hurry to return.",
   "I had the Renegade Shrimp and a mango margarita. They were both delicious! Our server was also great! Can't remember her name but she has blonde hair. We will definitely return!"

   "Visiting from GA. A bit of a wait to get a menu. The blonde said she forgot. Our waiter was really nice and helpful. He kept our drinks refilled. Food was good. Nachos come with shredded cheese which is something I'm not used to but my waiter brought me cheese sauce. Overall I would definitely recommend this place. Food came fast and was hot. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it was a bit of a wait for menus from cashiers. They seemed distracted.",

   "A really happening place with a good bar and live music. I attended a birthday dinner here and had the tuna appetizer and a steak. The ahi was cooked perfectly! The steak was closer to medium than rare but it was flavorful and a good cut of meat. The servers were polite and attentive. That makes it easy to see why this place is popular with the locals over 30.",
   "Delicious good food. I love this place and it's sister restaurant. Food always fresh and tasty. I try to get the rotating seasonal specials. Also get dessert, I never had a bad dessert from here before. Good selection and nice atmosphere, especially with the live music.",
   "This is hands down my favorite restaurants in Tallahassee. The food is phenomenal and always fresh. The staff are always friendly and I love the environment. I have tried many things on the menu and have never been disappointed. The stuffed fried green tomatoes are superb!!",
   "First time and it was great. Brought some friends from Atlanta here. Black and Bleu Mac !! Awesome. Nick was our waiter ..... Great service. Thanks Nick.",
   "It's hard to choose a dish since the entire menu is full of great dishes. There is a big bar area where you can catch live music or other entertainment. The main dining area is adjacent with two separate sections. Natural elements and local photography decorate the wall in a simple rustic fashion."
