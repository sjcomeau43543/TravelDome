   "A lovely place to visit anytime of the year. Bearing in mind that flowers are seasonal and peak season for roses is in June.  This gorgeous park also offers many gardens of other flower varieties to enjoy in spring, summer and fall.  Year-round visits take you through acres of walking trails winding around specimen trees and other lush vegetation.  An occasional spotting of a Great Blue Heron at the pond with other water fowl makes it extra special.  After meandering about relax on a bench or bring your own blanket and take in all the beauty.",
   "The park is beautiful with lots of areas to walk around and different gardens full of roses. The pond is lovely. The Pond House restaurant in the park is also great. It's a lovely place to visit in all seasons, and great for walking the dogs too!",
   "Well 1st off,it's winter so nothing was in bloom. However I love parks and I ended up there as I was doing some rideshare driving and I found my way in the area and couldn't resist. So the layout is beautiful. the park was very clean. Some parts looked romantic. I also love tree's. So I enjoyed those. I'm definitely going back when everything blooms. They had all the different species(of rosebushes) labeled.",
   "Good place to be when your stir crazy from quarantine. Social distancing and great scenery",
   "So pretty to walk around. The area is not huge but the space is well taken care of and a nice visit of you have some time and friends to walk and talk with :) great place for pictures if you like floral and landscape/garden settings. Depending on when you go some flowers might be going out of season so go earlier in the summer for a fuller scene"

   "Great place to spend a day with the family. Lots of fun and learning activities. There is a 3D theater with several shows a day. Butterfly exhibit is very enjoyable. If you are lucky, a butterfly may just land on you. There is a separate fun playground-like area where the kids can play with the water-based machines. For the water activities, there are rain covers available of various sizes. I would recommended that the parents bring a pair of water-proof shoes for the child since the feet do get wet. There is a food court offering a variety of sandwiches and pizza. There is a tea and coffee stand, a snack vending g machine and a Frozen yogurt stand.",
   "In my option this is the best kids museum in the state. There are multiple floors of learning entertainment for kids of all ages. On the first floor there\u2019s a water play area. On another floor there\u2019s space, LEGO play zone, and an environmental area with live animals and. A flowing river to understand water dynamics. They always have rotating exhibits like a live butterfly garden and an energy STEM exhibit. The place is always clean and well cared for. A bonus is the great view from the top floor of Hartford and the Connecticut River. For food, there\u2019s a subway and ice cream place. The gift shop has awesome stem toys. To note: the parking garage I the building is often full when there\u2019s a convention at the convention center next door but there are other nearby garages within a block. \n\nIn the past they have done an exchange with Mystic Aquarium whereby your membership at one gets you in the other for a month for free.",
   "Wow, this place is packed with so many neat exhibits and things to learn and experience. You can touch, listen and play while learning with all ages. There's dinosaurs to how sound works to energy and lights. Great place to check out with kids or just yourself. Cant wait to go back.",
   "Kids love to come here. They had a cool sock skating rink that the kids thoroughly enjoyed. They change out different areas which is nice so that there is always something new to see or do.",
   "The CT Science Center is excellent on many levels...Six exactly.  The different exhibits they offer are for a wide variety of ages and they switch things out frequently enough that you never feel like it's an old hat.  We were gifted a membership and it's one of the greatest gifts we could have ever received.  Certainly one of Hartford's shining stars."

   "Enjoyed touring the Mark Twain House & Museum. The writer loves WOOD!!! so you will see the beautiful woods everywhere inside the house. The writer had a great taste for designing house requiring a lot of woods. Every room of the house I visited had been impressively restored to beautiful condition. Taking photos inside home and touching any thing is not allowed!!! Great historical location. Highly recommend so you won't regret!",
   "As a big Mark Twain fan, this was a treat! Highly recommend the reenactor-guided tours. Our guide, Samuel's daughter Suzie, was so knowledgeable!  She made the tour especially interesting with little tidbits of information you wouldn't know to ask, all shared from Suzie's perspective. Truly a delight!",
   "A fantastic museum and a look at a very different time and way of life. Easy to get to and park. Great museum store. Tour guides are fantastic. A bit pricey but totally worth it and there are different pricing options. Will go again for sure.",
   "Of course this is a must place to visit if you are interested in culture, history and famous writers. Very interesting and informative tour. Guide is super friendly and knows a lot! Museum as well. Free parking. Clean restrooms.",

The space is so inspiring and just perfect for art + Hartford lovers! You and your guests are surrounded by art and sculpture and color which creates a wonderful backdrop for your day. Love this venue as a Hartford local and artist!",
   "History museum is really quite good. Better than I expected. A beautiful building easy to walk around and a very manageable collection. In addition we had lunch in the cafe and the food was great. I would recommend this excursion to anybody looking to spend some museum time in the Hartford area. It is $12 per adult for admission however.",
   "A must-see visitors museum. A local favorite that many locals fail to enjoy to its fullest offering. The many galleries provide great viewing of rotating exhibitions and permanent ones.\nPlenty of transportation options afford easy access to this great location in downtown Hartford. Free coat room services and nice cafe.",
   "A beautiful home lovingly restored to the Clemons family era. Highly recommend a living history tour. George Griffin,the butler, gives a fabulous view."

I visited on a Saturday morning with friends and their children, and the kids enjoyed climbing, jumping, and swinging at the brand new playground, which just opened in November. It is located just next to the carousel, making for a fun few hours. I appreciated the way that the playground was designed to evoke nearby architecture, and my friends' elementary-aged son appreciated its educational aspect. He pointed out to the adults that there was information about how bills become laws, presented in a way that kids could understand. I don't often find myself in downtown Hartford, but my recent experience at Bushnell Park gives me a great reason to return.",

And they offered guided tours as well.\nIf you're a AAA member it's only $3 to get in. I spent about an hour here, about 15 minutes on each of the top floors and the rest on the bottom, which has a small museum set up about the History of Connecticut.\nIf you have a little time to spend, I recommend stopping in and giving them your support. And you can see a gorgeous painting of George Washington, one of the only originally located portraits by Gilbert Stewart in the country.",

Long a centerpiece of Hartford and the state of Connecticut, this modest building packs in more exhibits and history than any single tour could cover. The tours are information-filled to be sure, and they leave you with your head buzzing and an appetite to learn more. The OSH is continually evolving, incorporating new historical facts, adapting to new audience perspectives and needs, and introducing new programs and ways of experiencing history that the modern visitor will find relevant and provocative.",

The exterior is modern and 'cold' but the interior will take your breath away. Open, spacious and modern but traditional in that it had the stained glass. But it's all very grand and absolutely gorgeous. The ceiling lights are shaped like stars and they look 3-D. This is one of the most amazing churches I've seen to date.",

The sheer size and height of the space are humbling but it's the enveloping affect of the stained glass windows the worshipper is left with.  The narrative expressed is clear and in combination with the intense colors, the overall experience is heartwarming, breathtaking, and draws the person forward to focus on the altar, the center of Catholic worship."

   "This is the smallest state museum I've seen and the most in need of a budget infusion.  Times are tough, no one wants to pay for educational places.  Still, in their exhibit on Colt firearms, one of the typed tags had an incorrect word crossed out and rewritten.",
   "Small museum that can be visited in under an hour. Admission is free. The exhibitions are a loose collection of local items and memorabilia. While interesting when seen individually, they lacked the cohesive story and narrative expected of a history museum. Also missing are the exhibitions that would fill the gap and allow visitors to piece together a story. Some serious curatorial work is definitely in order.\n\nThe museum is in an elegant building that also houses a public library and courthouse. Check them out as they are quite beautiful and picture-worthy.",

The tour was enjoyable and relevant to modern events, despite taking place in a 150+ year old house. The house itself was beautiful and almost all of the furniture and art is original. Best of all, the gift shop focuses on modern political movements and writings that echo the importance of Beecher's work in her own time. This is an important museum in our time and does not feel like a dated history lesson. Well worth the trip.",

There is a boat dock in case you want to sail your boat on the river. You can cross the bridge in the end of the park and you are in Downtown Hartford within minutes. Great place for families.",
   "Great River Park is a great place to take either a run or a walk in either Hartford proper or East Hartford.  Walker/runners can access The Riverwalk foot bridge  and cross the Connecticut River.  The whole park is scenic and there's other folks around during midday, which makes it a very safe place to exercise.",
   "This park is one of my favorite places to go for walks. Depending on which direction you go, you will come across lots of wonderful things. One side has a lot of plants and cool trails of varying difficulty, and the other side takes you farther along the river and to different art installations having to do with a former U.S. president. It's really quite lovely. The walk has plenty of benches but due to the fact that the park floods up to a certain level every year, not all of the benches are safe to sit on. Overall, it's a nice easy walk in either direction that can get you some great photos and won't be too difficult if you have a mild disability or are in a wheelchair. It's also quite romantic at sunset, and a known spot for families and lone people that love the view from their car.",
   "The only problem with this park is the stench from the trash to energy plant across the river, It's a shame that the d.e.p. does nothing about it.\nI am hoping it closes soon! I have complained for twenty years plus to no avail, this facility has ruined Hartford,  East Hartford, Wethersfield, and anywhere else you can smell the rotting garbage!"

   "This was my first visit to the Butler McCook House. The garden is beautiful. I was surprised at the amount of Chinese artifacts that were there in addition to the New England treasures!",
   "This is a fascinating place to delve into Hartford history through the lens of a family who stayed in their house over many generations while Hartford downtown grew up around them. Four siblings last lived in the house until their deaths, and the story of their lives captured the interest of our whole family.",
   "Great location for music with Among the Acres",
   "Truly an Oasis in the middle of a City Desert(Concrete Jungle), with a beautiful assortment of flowers, bushes, and trees, it is another world inside the city of busy businessmen, we need to slow down and smell the roses\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udd96\u2764\ud83d\ude4f"

   "It is a huge arch. This memorial is such a majestic city landmark. Its so beautiful even just driving through or gazing from Bushnell Park. We couldn\u2019t climb but Im sure it would be worth it. This is truly a gem in the middle of the Hartford. Autumn season is the best time ti visit.",
   "Eye-catching structure welcoming visitors to Bushnell Park and the State Capitol. I was curious about its history so I checked the park website and learned that:\n\n\"The arch was dedicated on September 17, 1886... to honor the 4,000 Hartford citizens who served in the Civil War, and the 400 who died for the Union... Be sure to read the bronze plaque under the freed slave which honors the 128 African American residents of Hartford who fought for the Union...\n\nThis Gothic monument is made of brownstone from Portland, Connecticut, and cost about $60,000 (from the city treasury) to build.\"",
   "Very nice park! Lovely to take a stroll around! Great views of the capital. A little piece of history!",
   "When you\u2019re in Bushnell Park, it\u2019s worth a diversion just to look at this edifice up close...its really a marvel of engineering and worthy of one\u2019s eyebrows to be raised for what it memorializes!",

   "Very interesting tour of Chick Austin's house in the wealthy and beautiful area of Hartford!  He was the art director of the Wadsworth Atheneum from 1927-1944 and was innovative at the museum by introducing modern art to America. The house is a historic house museum built in the Neo-Palladian style and is only one room deep while being long in length. It is filled with 17th- to 20th- century Italian and German furnishings, with the second-floor modern style with Bauhaus designs.",
   "A little oddity in Hartford. It's a private building and you cant get too close, but you can still get the idea from the sidewalk. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you're in the area it's fun to check out.",
   "Absolute gem. If you care about art, culture, or interior design in the 1930s, the Austin house is a must. The house has been lovingly restored and the tour guide was knowledgeable and very engaging. Also, just responding to another reviewer, thr Austin house is not private; it\u2019s owned by the Wadsworth Atheneum and is opened to tours twice a month\u2014you just have to call to book in advance. Well worth the $ and the time!!!",

I also was sick of the quad/ATV riders ripping through the place. \n\nWhile that has improved, the place is still trashy. There is literally trash all over the place. \n\nWhile the park does host many games, at most time it is empty. Part of the green new deal is to ensure everyone has access to outdoor space, but no one even uses what they currently have.",

   "It was a beautiful day to stroll through the park even at then of the day when all sporting events were winding up. The breeze was subtle, music was still playing in the background, kids still running back and forth on the courts- in the grass & some just snuggled in moms' arms as they watched the softball games. Nice progress on fixing the park in general.",

   "Beautiful wooded hike with an amazing view along the top of a \"mountain\". The majority of the hike is fairly close (or very close) to the cliff,  so if you have young children be careful. The park is well used; we were there on a weekday evening in the fall and passed approximately 20 other people in the park. There are a few different trails, one being a wide well cleared path away from the ledge, and another narrow slightly more rugged path along the ledge. There are few connector and side trail options, but they all essentially lead to the same spot. A gorgeous building at the peak. There's a gift shop and museum area, unfortunately they were just closing as we arrived. Note, there are one or two connector trail points, well marked, which cross this trail and are part of a much larger trail system, these do not lead to either the building nor the park parking lot."

When you look at the views all around the park the first word I can think of is Heavenly! So many gardens to visit (total of 10 ranging from \u00bd acre to 8 acres!) and see all the different kinds of flowers and how it is set up. I was in heaven with my professional! So many different places and scenery for pictures of any kind! I always thought it was really neat to see they had the Aviary there; the kids also enjoy it! \nThe sensory garden is my favorite ~ not just because my husband proposed to me in front of a beautiful statue where a couple bonded together holding hands and forming the shape of a heart \uf04a. One of these years I will buy a brick with our wedding date on it \uf04a I recommend for anyone in CT to go and check this park out.",

I've only recently discovered this place but I will most definitely be buying season passes next year.  The grounds are maintained very well and the staff are super helpful.  The various gardens and sitting areas are beautiful. \nVery kid friendly for all ages.  There is a per car fee to get in or you can buy the season pass.",
   "Wickham Park was an incredible experience. I attended my granddaughter's wedding here. The grounds, the \"lodge\", the scenery and the staff was totally fantastic. The view across the valley was amazing. The lodge's dance floor had ample room for everyone with the energy to dance the night away. The grounds with unique walkways that wound around a garden of trimmed shrubs and flowers - all leading back to the lodge. The entire staff was attentive to your every need. The night lighting was set to seclude if you chose and open enough to safely walk about the gardens. You will experience a memorable event with any venue here at Wickham Park. I surely did.",
   "Beautiful park. The grounds and the landscaping are amazing. Great place to go with the family for an hour or two. The gardens are also amazing. You\u2019ll see a great view of Hartford as well. They also have a small little bird zoo too!",
   "This is a great Park that is far bigger and more interesting that I had originally imagined it.  If only for the sheer variety of things to see and do is Wickham Park worth visiting.  The various gardens on the grounds were beautiful and well kept even in October. Only down side was this place is clearly a destination for weddings and wedding photography and we couldn't go for more than few minutes without getting in someone's shots."

   "We really enjoyed our visit to the museum. There was plenty to appeal to older history and war buffs,  as well as young children who can play \"house\" in a colonial setup. Lots of interesting CT history as expected, as well as interesting exhibits like a film about commercial items manufactured in CT and vintage toy commercials. We loved the war artifacts and left with a feel for historical CT sentiment regarding the Revolutionary and Civil wars. We had lots of laughs in the canoe display.",
   "The place is large and well organized, when you enter someone tells you where you should go. The duration in depends on how fast you see things but it is between half an hour and an hour. On the second floor there are many fun and educational activities for children. \nWe went today because it was free the entrance but if you have to pay l don\u2019t know how much.",
   "A lot of information you can learn about CT by visiting CT Historical Society Museum in Hartford. The museum is open for public for free first Saturday each month. However, I was surprised to see the size of the museum and the artifacts they have I thought since it's named CT historical society, I thought it would be bigger and the most museum that has artifacts in the state.",
   "We have visited the Connecticut Historical Society (CHS) Museum in Hartford, Connecticut multiple times, most recently on Saturday, January 5, 2019, and have always enjoyed it. Both the permanent and special exhibits in this museum have consistently been nice representations of Connecticut\u2019s history. Although we only were able to spend about an hour and a half at the museum this time, we estimate that it would take at least two hours to see this museum and appreciate all that it has to offer. Admission into this museum was free because it was the first Saturday of the month but museum passes may be available at your local library for free admission on other days.",
   "Loved the museum and the standup storytelling show they host."

I liked that one of the staff came out for a presentation.   I've seen so many dinosaur skeleton exhibits in other places. This was great to have a place focused on tracks. There was so much to learn.",
   "Fantastic place. A hidden gem in the middle of Connecticut. The staff do a great job of bringing the history of the park together with the history of the dinosaurs that once roamed the area. Great for a family day trip or a school field trip.",

   "Great Hike, super busy many many people. First part is the hardest of the trail, the rest is a nice walk. The views are beautiful! Nice little picnic area near the tower all worth it.",

It's cleaned once a week from the paperwork posted. Just bring disinfectant wipes for the seat. There was plenty of paper.\n\nThey have plenty of benches for family but unless you get there early and \"claim\" one, you might have to bring your own. People were grilling on small portable grills, no grills that the park provides. Huge amount of park space for these sort of gatherings. Not enough parking near the playground, but there is quite a bit down the hill by where the Porta potty is at.",

There price is very reasonable compared to other similar places around the area. One of there employees named Diego was very helpful. He was very quick to help my girlfriend when she fell and got stuck on one of the courses. The staff was always making sure that everyone was safe and doing good. The entire staff was very observant of everyone on the courses and were always very quick to help anyone that needed it no matter how big or small. I would highly recommend checking them out. My family and I will definitely be going back many times.",

Great for locals to hang out or relax. The Ducks destroyed the baseball field with droppings otherwise as I said it\u2019s a local park with some events during the summer.",

   "It's a great place for my toddler, she can do different types of games and be running around as the playground has a very decent size.\nOne plus is that the playgrounds floors are cushioned.",
   "This is really one of my favorite parks here in the area. It is quiet and peaceful, very nice for watching turtles and a variety of birds.  It is always well-kept, easy and relaxing to walk the full loop around the pond.  The playground is extensive and has a lot of options and variety for kids so that there is plenty of space.  The playground's astro turf was delightful.  Felt like walking on a marshmallow. There is a public swimming pool, but I'm a little confused with the hours of operation since it has always been closed and the water level low every time I have seen it.  There's a baseball field, a basketball court, free parking... but always my personal favorite is the little waterfall under the bridge that you always see in pictures. My wife and I came here for wedding pictures."

It never seemed like it would be worth the trip, but it was actually much bigger than I had expected.  It was a great afternoon with the kids. They are sculptures that surround the building which made for a nice walk before going inside.\n\nMost of the art on the inside are paintings, of course.  The have a wide variety of art from various time periods and styles.  I'm not a huge art buff, but there are paintings there by several artists that are household names.\n\nAnd the price was right.  The tickets for my 8 and 12 year olds were both free and my ticket was only $15.  A really nice afternoon family outing at a great price.",

Furthermore, unlike many air museums, New England has many many aircraft that visitors can sit in. There is a wonderful play area for children. But the best part is easily the Docents. They are each so kind and so knowledgeable about the museum exhibits but even more so, several of them flew and, if you\u2019re interested, have many wonderful and funny stories. This museum is well worth the time spent there.",

   "Very cool place to see airplanes up close and learn about aviation. It's pretty awesome to hear the air traffic of Bradley while wondering the 3 massive hangers filled with cool planes. You can sit in SOME of them and having Veteran Volunteers really makes all the difference as you get REAL stories and knowledge from people who ACTUALLY flew these planes.",

On busy summer weekends they may have as many as four or five trolleys operating. They vary from open air cars to completely enclosed.

We were the 1st ride of the night and we had to stop so someone could get out and turn the lights on at every display.  Also the tunnel affect lights were out for the last half of ride.  \nJust rode in darkness.   We stopped at end of track and they tried to fix them but didn't work.  They had a radio station on that played a christmas Carol for the first minute or so then we listed to radio commercials for most of the ride.  Very disappointing!",

It's a place to play, learn and explore for children of all ages and developemental abilities. The detail paid to the both the educational and play value if each display was stellar!

The museum used to be a large home/mansion and has several separate rooms to explore. There are quiet areas and bathrooms all over to relax, breastfeed, etc. I also appreciated all of the little touches, like signs about spare clothes' kits in case your child has a potty accident. Really cool kid's museum. My kids are 6.5 and 8.5 years old, and they didn't want to leave. So much to do. Budget at least 2 hours and longer is better.",
   "Really fun! So many different themes and activities. Saw staff consistently rotating through swiffering the floor and putting toys back so no matter when you got to room, most likely it was set up the way it was intended and  not left in disarray from the kids. Nice to see a place that is well maintained despite the how rough and relentless the clientele can be.",
   "Fantastic  place to bring the young ones.  The under 2 area is great when the little ones need some \"waddle\" space.  The 3 years old finds so many things that he loves.  This is one of his favorite places to go on our special outings."

This park has water rides so bring a bathing suit but also has enough regular rides where you can have a great time even without one. This is the oldest amusement park in the US and it really has an old timer feel. This park also has rides for people of all ages. It also has wooden roller coasters that are not the best option for people with bad backs, so be cautious. Lake Compounce is especially beautiful in the Fall. With New England\u2019s famous Fall Foliage and during Halloween time in particular there are extra fun events. The views from the park are also breathtaking. Lake Compounce itself is gorgeous and the wooded area surrounding the park are beautifully well",

   "Perfect for ages 2-7 but dress accordingly. The park is lite up beautifully, smaller rides going, hot cocoa and some Santa make for a perfect little evening out. People working at the concession stands could have been more professional but overall a great night!",
   "Drove here from Pennsylvania, was not disappointed. Very nice park just what we expected. Small but charming.",
   "Kids enjoyed this place. park that has been around a very long time but still has lots to do with many options. Watch out for the wooden roller coaster though very rough ride."

   "Fascinating walk back through history of communication.  All the way back to Marconi. \nMany reminders of my childhood.  Ham radio, television production, old shows,. So much to see.  Very hospitable docents.  They love what they do.",
   "Amazing museum for all broadcasting and media enthusiasts. A fair share of everything from the 1800's to the 90's. There's a fully functional HAM station that you can operate as long as you hold a HAM operator license. Keep in mind they only accept cash.",
   "What a hidden gem! I expected to tour the museum in about an hour  to one and a half hour range, nope! Three hours later...and my teens were engaged the whole time, as was I! \nI recommend taking the guided tour since the volunteers are so knowledgeable, passionate (about all forms of technology) and extremely personable!\n We will definitely plan another visit, as I know there is so much more to learn! *oh, and bring cash. They do not accept credit cards.",
   "As nice as it is to see functioned antique radio, television, telephony, morse etc equipment its even better to interact with the staff. They are volunteers and really love showing off the old equipment. You wont find more motivated people than these! They make the tours fun, interactive and they are quick to answer your questions!\n\nAs a former Radio Shack employee it was great to see some of the products still in everyday use. A lot of the stuff back in the day was built to last better than today's disposable electronics. Of particular note was an old 9V Radio Shack battery, not the cheap red batteries we used to give out with the battery of the month cards but one of the even earlier 'premium' 9Vs!\n\nIf I was going to deduct a star it would be that these devices are also used as a resource, sold off, split up, parted out etc. They are not making these antiques anymore. But its good to see them used and shown!",
   "Great place to visit. Very friendly and very knowledgeable staff. It's an eye opening display of where we have come from in the world of technology."

   "We played two rooms The Hidden Cabin and the Swiss Original. They were two very different room. The Cabin was your standard, pretty well themed room with some fun and unique puzzles. Overall we had a great time in this room. Wouldn\u2019t suggest more than 3-4 people due to the size however. \n\nThe second room Swiss original was very different than normal rooms (and they make this very clear upfront.) It is a series of 3 rooms filled with puzzles with no theming or story line. This was an interesting experience. It felt like a sprint through puzzles (which was a good thing honestly). It was fun to really speed through several different puzzle types. \n\nOnly down fall is it is difficult to find and the GM was helping two rooms at once which seemed to cause delays when we needed help on the very last puzzle.",

It also has an attached Firehouse museum which was very cool. Worth checking it out, definitely.",

Plenty of lifeguards all over, but it\u2019s always best to use your own judgement.  Definitely an all day event that will leave you exhausted!",
   "Tons of fun to be had here!  With a wide variety of activities ranging from impressive zip lines to a relaxing day swimming and lounging in the sun, there is definitely fun to be had for everyone.  Most of my group got the full adventure pass and spent the day zip lining, riding the water slide, and climbing around on the inflatable water features.  The less adventurous people went with the less expensive swim pass and had just as much fun staying on the ground / in the water.  (they too had the option to use the floating water features). The floating trampoline was a particular hit with the kids in our group.  We rented a gazebo for the day and I can not recommend that enough.  The gazebo was floating attached to one of the docks and we could swim right off of it.  Definitely planning on getting a season pass next year and going as often as possible.   I was recommended to bring water shoes since there can be quite a bit of walking if you plan on doing a lot of zip lining, and I found that to be good advice.  That being said, plenty of people were barefoot all day and didn't seem too bothered by it.  Great place to spend the day, whether your goal is adventure or simple relaxation.",
   "Fun place to go in the summer! Always a fun time here! Zip lining and jumping into the water was awesome here!",
   "Pretty neat waterpark.  Several zip lines ending in water.  The middle has floaties for kids and adults to enjoy.  They also have a climbing wall you can scale either the old fashioned way or on a metal ladder.  Can be a bit of a line though with slow climbers.  Recommend you have shoes on for this.",
   "Cool place be prepared for a workout you will leave here sore and tired. Oh and you can bring your own food and drinks cooler permitted and chairs. Great for an all day family event! Had tons of fun kids and adults will love it. They provide life jackets ugh but majority if not all are broken and falling apart with gashing holes and just icky only downside I could think of."

   "All of our food was delicious, and obviously very fresh. Service was fantastic and she went out of her way to help us find stuff to do in the area. Cheese bread was good but nothing special. Complimentary biscotti was a nice touch for sure.\nAll in all, the prices ended up being really reasonable for lunch. Definitely going back again.",
   "Visited this place for the first time.  The food was awesome, but most of all the service was amazing!  The place was packed, but you would never know it by the service we received.  They made you feel at home and they were genuinely kind.  Our food was delivered quick and it was delicious.  We  will definitely be returning.  Thank you for such a great experience.",
   "This is how it's supposed to work. You're going to be in Hartford (an unfamiliar city) for one night, so you go to TripAdvisor, and make reservations at the #1 rated restaurant. You show up on time, and even though the place is hopping, your table is ready. You have your first of seven encounters with waitstaff, and it's friendly and good-humored, as if you are family. Right away you know that someone has taught this team how important their efforts are to the overall experience.",
   "Awesome restaurant with great atmosphere. Good prices. Our server Vinny was awesome and the food fantastic. I have the No. 11 Special and was very pleased. Table service was fast and steady, while one of the owners stopped at our table as well.",
   "I went there for lunch with my family. It wasn\u2019t very crowded and the service was top quality. The waitress was so friendly and polite and the food was very delicious. We loved the cheese and bread started so much!! They also offered us free cookies to take away when we finished. Great experience"

   "I didn't know what to expect from the outside view, but I was very pleased with the Trumbull Kitchen's lunch options during a recent business trip. The place was recommended by a coworker who is local to the area. I was told that it can fill up quickly during lunch, but we had no problems getting seated for a group of five at noon. \n\nThe beer list is outstanding with some top of the line Connecticut craft brews, as well as some national staples. The menu had a lot of great options, and my bourbon burger was outstanding. The sweet potato fries were also very well prepared. \n\nThe interior setting and seating is very stylish, with an old school speakeasy motif. Service was also very pleasant and responsive. \n\nI will definitely be back the next time I'm in Hartford!",
   "Food and atmosphere was really nice. We had a great waitress and deserts were delicious. Definitely a good spot to go back too.",
   "Food was good, great venue, ate at the bar, nice crowd.  Nice adult feel.  Good outside patio seating.",
   "Very good meal, attentive server.  Seated quickly with reservation.  Food came hot and. In a timely manner.  Wasn't to loud, though it was moderately crowd for a Wednesday evening.  Good experience",
   "Ordered the Grilled Fillet Mignon as an appetizer and it was delicious.  Steak was perfectly cooked (rare) and the tater tots on top added a nice crunch. Everyone enjoyed their meals as well. Very nice ambience with plenty of room in between tables. Will definitely will go back!"

Also important, the charge is modest. I tell about this restaurant with pleasure.",

   "What an amazing and wonderful experience!!!! Be warned, it is a on the pricey side! So worth every dollar though! The steak was so flavorful and delicious, the lobster crab cakes were more lobster and crab than cake. The crab on top of the steak wasn't held back, but piled on! Lobster Mac and cheese so creamy and big pieces of lobster! I have never had a better glass of wine or better dessert! Don't walk....drive there! The valet is fantastic as well! Very speedy and helpful!",
   "I celebrated my PhD this evening in this delicious restaurant. Well we passed a magnificent evening and the restaurant was evidently one of the reasons for this outstanding celebration.

   "Great great great restaurant. We actually went back a second time in the same trip the food was so great. Prime rib was amazing, the pasta small plates were great, the tartar and buffalo cauliflower were great. Honestly everything was so good, we got the baked Alaska twice, if you like marshmallow this is for you.",
   "Some parts are amazing and other parts need improvement.  The decor of this place is amazing.  Love the design of the bar and dining areas.  The mixed drinks are great too.  Probably the best old fashioned I've ever had was made here. Some of the food was great too; lobster pierogi and Mac & cheese were great. That said, the prime rib was sub par. I've had better elsewhere and have even made better at home. It was under cooked, very fatty, and was served with a horrible knife.  I might as well have been given a butter knife to cut this stringy cut of meat. Overall, the whole experience was simply inconsistent.",
   "Relaxing place to have a late afternoon/happy hour bite & cocktails. Service is impeccable and our bartender was \"bar none\" ;) an artist making a delicious Negroni and beautiful Aperol Spritz! The atmosphere is upscale-downtown while still maintaining a casual feel. The seafood is always fresh and plated to please. Anyone passing through Hartford near the XL Center or locals who are making a stop @ the \"banking corner\" should duck into Max Downtown!",
   "One of the most reliable \"great dining experiences\" in greater Hartford and still, I think, the flagship restaurant of the Max family of restaurants.  Always superb beef and fish entrees that make me think of this as a chop house style reminiscent of the great Manhattan restaurants of the 50's and 60's but with a sophisticated contemporary design.  The bar is a great choice for a convenient lunch if you don't have the time to indulge."

Came in on a very cold rainy day and just felt the warmth just walking inside. Good food, music, service. Also great atmosphere. Was within easy walking distance from our hotel. Loved their ribs and the artwork on the walls. Recommend it highly.",
   "Have been a few times and the Nashville hot chicken sandwich has consistently been better than the last time. It was pretty good to begin with. Cornbread is good and a few other things I've tasted were good as well. Not a fan of the prices or the portion sizes always but it's pretty good food.\n\nI don't go for decor but if that's your thing, I'm not fond of it. I think it's going for like a New Orleans vibe but whatever it is but I don't care for it. But as I said it doesn't make a difference to me.",
   "Omg! This place was bomb. The vibe was perfect. The food reminded me so much of home. I am from the south and they definitely have got the taste and flavorings just right. We stopped in on a Thursday night where a live band was playing. The music was so good. Everyone was having a great time. If I am ever in Hartford again I will definitely be popping in.",
   "We took the Fastrack bus line from New Britain to go here to see \"Jake Kulak and the Lowdown\". They had a small cover charge, but the band was awesome and so it was well worth it. As a matter-of-fact, I had gone here before to see another great young local band,  \"The New Amsterdam Nobles\". They put on a great show and the crowd as really into it. \nI don't know who books the live acts here, but they know good music. \nThe food and drinks were all good and the prices were reasonable. I'd recommend trying the ribs or perhaps the wings.\nThe waitstaff was attentive and kept up nicely with demand.\nThis is a nice place to go for a meal or just drinks...",
   "Best BBQ that I have eaten in Hartford! The chicken and waffles were surprisingly great. The way they fry chicken is just down home goodness. The flavors from the ribs, beef brisket and chicken were savory with just the right amount of sweet. The rib meat did not quite fall off the bone, but they had awesome smokey flavor. The fixings were next level with melt in your mouth cornbread and red beans & rice. We will be going back soon. Bonus, walking distance to the XL center."

   "Bear's BBQ is a cafeteria style restaurant. You get in line, place your order, receive a tray, get your sides and beverage. You pay for your food and go and find your seat. Bear's BBQ is the best BBQ in Connecticut in terms of a restaurant. The food is great every single time and it's high quality food that you can get very quickly. The mac attack is my staple. It's macaroni and cheese topped with Pulled Pork (you can choose your style of meat). The meat and pasta are always cooked perfect. Something about the Birch Beer here is better than anywhere else that I've had it.",
   "The food here was very good. If you like BBQ, this Smoke House is the place to visit. For lunch, dinner, take out and, they even do catering. If you are in the Hartford or the Hew Haven area, you won't want to pass this place up.\n\nVery large menu, great sides, desserts and an outstanding staff. Customer service was very nice and with a smile of kindness. Very helpful and attentive. The Brisket was on the money good. \n\nParking might cost you about $3.00 an hour because, you may have to use a parking garage. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give a 5 Star is because, the food wasn't served very hot. However, I highly recommend.",
   "The foods good but the staff is not. I tried to call in and waited 20 minutes and no one picked up. Also tried to order online. I'm about to click checkout when the clock hits 7 30 pm. They wont let you place the order. Had credit card info and everything but still wouldn't let me order. Also the food is very expensive to go along with all of it.",
   "Come here if you want to see how cheap someone can be. The way they cut the meat is like asking a hungry homeless guy to share his food. I've never watched someone work so hard to cut so little. If they cut a little extra off they'll actually put it back in the wrapping and not on your plate. Its amazing to watch. Then they'll tell you its $20 and ask for tip. Following you'll take your jailhouse tray and seat yourself.\n\nIn short: Got food poisoning and pretty expensive for the small portions and the fact you have to seat yourself. Won't go back",
   "Ordered and paid a week ahead of time for Easter. Had to wait almost an hour just to pick our order. Then many of the things we ordered (a week ago remember) were not available. Total bust. Very little respect for their customers if they can\u2019t honor what people have ordered. Won\u2019t be going back"

   "I was blown away by the food. We had a slow start with service, but that was remedied. We came for the monk fish and were not disappointed. It was incredible. And... HALF PRICE BOTTLES OF WINE. I am not sure how long they are doing this promotion, but it was Friday night and we had an amazing petite syrah bottle for a steal. It was worth every penny."

   "We frequented the branch in Naperville years ago, and were pleasantly surprised when we noticed one in Hartford. The decor remains the same blend of wooden panels and green leather. The menu is also what we remembered. The crab cakes we're as great as ever with a guacamole spread. And the bison pot roast is tender and goes well with the mash potatoes.  It's great that some things remain the same.",
   "Awful service. Waiting over an hour for food. 45 minutes to be told they were 86 on crab cakes, and 30 minutes for drinks. Just ridiculous! Plus our server David came over once to check on us!! After visiting the science museum, their website  recommended dinning at Teds. I would  highly not recommend going there at all unless you like waiting and sitting there for 2.5 hours. I understand things get busy but no common courtesy to keep us informed. This food was nothing special! I couldn\u2019t honestly get it anywhere. I suggest working with your staff to ensure a better service.  Waste of money and time being there.",

   "Located right across from an outdoor municipal carpark, it remains a happy Italian bistro. I stopped by a few weeks ago for a pizza and an iced tea. Their pizzas are not inexpensive but so it goes everywhere now. I must applaud the waitress who was outstanding in service. The pizza was delivered to my table quickly and was bubbling hot. My only problem was salty mozz. I use fresh at home all the time and this cheese was either soaking in salt water, or more salt had been used in the recipe. So here's the daft me. I removed the cheese, and brought that DELICIOUS CRUST home with me. You know a good pizza crust by just how long it can remain in your fridge. This crust is thin and yummy, and so three days later, I found myself making a sauteed veggie pizza using the same crust. I will try another type of pizza the next time I visit because I like the vibe. There's a bar counter for those who are the beer and lunch set, but I was fortunate to have a table. A different sort of review, I know!",
   "Great happy hour and even better meals.  I highly suggest checking this place out.  The happy hour options are fantastic.  The house red blend wine is delicious, the pizza is cheap but amazing, and all the ingredients taste fresh so the meals are exceptional.",

Being able to support a community effort while having a first class dining experience is a winning combination. Service was excellent. The hummus was good and the Brussels Sprouts appetizer was the best we have ever had. My duck was tasty but they should have removed the extra fat. The salmon dish was also a winner.",

   "Let me say first off, the service was excellent. Wonderful setting and ambiance.\n\nI ordered the 14 Oz NY strip steak. Ordered as medium rare and it came out medium-well and dry. Potato puree was lumpy, was borderline cold, and had zero flavor. Sauce was over reduced and incredibly bitter. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their food so I guess steak wasn\u2019t the best choice? Too bad. Mushroom bisque was flavorful but very grainy. Good drink list.",
   "The last couple of times my wife and I have had a babysitter, we have come here for our date night. The food is exquisite. We always get the Brussels sprouts and I have had both the duck and the pork shank which were to die for. It's a nice laid back atmosphere with energetic and attentive service and great food and libations. If you live in the area and haven't been, you truly must go!",

   "I was in downtown Hartford on a Sunday afternoon with some friends and was really excited to see that this place was open. A lot of restaurants are closed on Sundays in the area so that was a relief. The restaurant doesn't have its own parking lot but there is street parking and even a garage right across the street. We walked in and the place was already busy (around 3pm) so we sat at the bar. Our bartender was nice and checked on us a few times while we were sitting. We got the chicken bacon ranch and the pulled chicken pizza which were both good. The crushed dorito seasoning really adds to most of the pizzas. Additionally the drinks and cocktails they offer are creative and all very good. I'd recommend a visit in, good food and good drinks.",
   "The pizzas were awesome, and the staff was so welcoming and friendly. We didn't realize at the time, but we went near closing time. They didn't make a fuss over that at all and served us without a rush. We later found out we had cut it a little close and felt bad, but they were so kind about it. We really appreciated it, and we'll definitely be back!",
   "The Pup, Pints, and Pizza event at The Blind Pig is so much fun. Their food is always great as is the service. My server tonight couldn't have been better. Look for their special events; they do some really cool themed dinners. I need to go to try their happy hour menu and their Monday night tacos, which I'm sure are as great as their regular menu.",
   "Our family loves the pizza and mozzarella sticks. We always get a couple cheese pizzas with a meatball pizza and sometimes a bacon pizza. Bacon has a kick to it. Love the charred taste of the crust. The marinara for the mozzarella sticks used to be like a vodka sauce but this past week they changed it. Basic marinara taste but excellent. Usually there isn\u2019t anywhere to sit but Valentine\u2019s Day evening no one was there except at the bar. We always get our food to go but plan on dining in one day soon. Definitely very tasty and fresh food!",
   "Best pizza in Hartford, possible the best in the state. Perfect crust, great and unique styles, restaurant has nice ambiance. On my last visit (5/19) they were clearly short handed but Sarah R was still wonderful despite it being so hectic. Cent wait to come back."

We always thought that chowder pot was the best place to always go for seafood, I can tell you No No No way, from we walked into the place the waitress was extremely nice positive they made sure that we were very comfortable and happy. when we was ready to placed our order we got the shovel that was amazing I mean like it had the best part of the seafood you can would have to buy separately.",
   "Very casual very fresh...one side a fresh fish market the other a restaurant. They make very best clam chowder, great lobster bisque and we have not had a meal there we did not enjoy. Haddock with lobster stuffing is a favorite, along with fried haddock and chips. The lobster roll is great and come on the freshest most substantial roll.",
   "J. - Crab was originally Tinkers in the good ole days. Very little has changed. If you want good, fresh, tasty seafood J - Crab is a great place for it. Always bustling with seafood hungry folks, noisy and filled with laughter. Quality food portions so you won't leave hungry. Highly recommended. Yum!",
   "Great fish and chips. I always get the fish and shrimp combo comes with fries. And the clam chowder is awsome. Been going to the old location on new park Ave for years and now there new location here. Great place to eat seafood.  Better than City fish market."

   "Not sure how this place even stays in business \u2013 so often it is virtually empty during peak dining hours. With such amazing food, it deserves to have a far wider audience and clientele. Have dined here a number of times and have never been disappointed once! Located on Zion Street, behind Trinity College in Hartford, the restaurant is small, cozy yet chic. Parking is on the street. Beer and wine available.",
   "Awesome food.. Homely decor.. (literally its a home converted to a business) The lady takes care of the guests really well.. I loved every bit of my veggie panini.. The Tiramisu was awesome too.. The lunch service can be little slow, but you will enjoy the food.",
   "The food was delicious and the atmosphere was inviting. The prices were reasonable as well. We had the squash ravioli as an appetizer, with the  balsamic vinegar added it was a very unique and delicious treat. We both ordered salmon entrees, but one was a salmon salad the other was with potatoes and veggies. They were superb!!",
   "Some of the best food anywhere. Squash ravioli are to die for. Soups are hearty, tasty and homemade. Vegetables are fresh and usually organic. Even the little knot dinner rolls are fabulous. Serves wine and beer only. Highly recommended!",
   "If for some reason you still haven't eaten here, you're truly missing out. It has to be one of the very best restaurants in the area. Like so many people have said, the homemade butternut squash ravioli can be habit forming. All of the pasta dishes are wonderful though. The Bolognese is the best I've tasted. The owners, who do the cooking and the serving, also could not be any lovelier if they tried."

   "I came here with a friend to try the Taste of Hartford menu after work. I'd recommend making a reservation, I'm not sure if it was so busy because of restaurant week or if it's usually like that, but people were definitely waiting. \nThe food was was good. I got Rhode island clam chowder, blue crab casserole, and the cheesecake. The soup was really good, it had a fair amount of salt but I like salt personally. The crab casserole was also good with big chunks of crab. The stuffing was alright but I personally found it too buttery with too much bread. \nOur waiter was extremely attentive and friendly. All the staff seemed to be friendly with a smile.\nThe inside seems to be a little dated and needs some updates. Also make sure you drive around to the back since that is the main restaurant entrance.",
   "Yum! \ud83d\ude0b\n\nThe entire experience was fantastic. The hostess greeted us with a smile and was genuinely happy. We were told our wait time would be approximate 35-40 min, which was fine for us. Our wait time was closer to 10 minutes! \n\nOur server was knowledgeable about the menu and very cheerful. She was very accommodating with our inability to pick something. There are so many great choices on their menu. We finally decided on the Oysters and Escargot for our appetizers. The oysters were delicious and the Escargot was presented with puff pastry on top, soaked in butter and they were amazing! \n\nFor my entree I ordered the Lazy Man\u2019s Lobster, which was cooked perfectly and I didn\u2019t have to dig through the shell! The fries were delicious and the cole claw was also great. I can\u2019t remember what my boyfriend ordered, but I know he enjoyed his meal as well. If we\u2019re ever in the area again we\u2019ll defiantly eat here again!",
   "From the moment  you enter that place  team give you a great feeling. Very warm stuff, it is a kind restaurant to  enjoy with buddies or with your date. very good  cooking, professional  chief cook and stuff, modest  price and generous  service. Highly recommended.",
   "My wife and I ate there Sunday approximately 1 p.m. . service was great. Started with a shrimp cocktail, the shrimp wasn't fresh nice try. what the heck did you do to the clam chowder? Very few potatoes, and where were the Clans? and watery. Baked stuffed shrimp for dinner. Where's the flavor? I must admit, haven't eaten here over 10 years. The reason Crab Shack! If you want fresh food eat at The Crab Shack. I wanted Seafood and the Crab Shack was closed due to family problems so we decided to go to the Chowder Pot never again thank you",
   "TO GO ORDER ...VERY DISAPPOITING!\nChowder Pot is one of my favourite restaurant. Last week I place to-go order because I missed their food so much. How shock I was when I saw my order. There were half amount of food that I got when I dine-in and it was not fresh at all!! ! I paid a lot of money but it was not worth it at all!!!"

The food at Vivo is excellent, we've enjoyed both breakfast and dinners there. Our breakfast waitress, Christine, is always smiling and provides great customer service. They're lucky to have her! Nadine Mullings has also always provided great service. She's a true professional.",

   "I love the settings and the atmosphere. It\u2019s lovable! I would have rate this five stars if only things went the way it should be. And I completely understand it was a holiday, so I had my patience with everything that was going wrong the minute we sat down. Despite that, I honestly highly recommend this place for guys who are looking to make their girl happy! Because it\u2019s also reasonable price:)!!",
   "I like to go with friends to this place with my highest recommendations. I  go to this restaurant often. This recommendation is always successful. The the food there is appetizing and the team is efficient and cooperative. Whenever we go to this place we have a cheerful time.  highly recommended.",
   "We had a great dinner there this past fall (2018). My dining partner and I wanting to order two different things, the steak and the gnocchi,  the waitress asked us if we wanted the chef to split the two items between us, which we happily agreed to do. Delicious pairing and amazing gnocchi. Our friend who joined us had a full order of gnocchi which he agreed was perfect. Modern interior. Attentive staff.\n\nFollow up visit in early May this year (2019): \nWe returned to have the share the same two entrees we did last fall they were so delicious. The steak with a reduced wine sauce, asparagus and red potatoes and the gnocchi. With restaurants, chefs can change or buyers for their menu items, so this visit was not as impressive. Our food was good but not exceptional as it was our first visit. The grilled sirloin steak seemed to be of lesser quality and the gnocchi con funghi was quite overcooked with a brown crust. Plenty of mushrooms, however. \n\nThis chef did not split our two dinners for us in the kitchen either. We each got one entree and were told to split them ourselves. The bread,  olive tapanade and bowl of olives that comes with your meal is still good, and our waitress did go and find some white bread for us when one of us couldn't eat seeds. Our friend who joined us liked his bolognese alla rigatoni very much. The atmosphere is spacious and pleasing decor wise. Our drinks were well made. There is a large wine selection, too. The appetizer portion of the menu could use a little variety as there's nothing we have felt like ordering this visit or the previous one. Photos from May meal below."

We appreciated their recommendations about the menu. Both cocktails and food were very good. We particularly enjoyed the shisito pepper appetizer, the short rib meatloaf, and the key lime pie. The ambiance is very pleasant. Not sure how noisy the restaurant would be if it was busy.",

   "My husband and went to Dish for brunch. We loved it! Our waiter Matt was very attentive and was a big part in making our dining experience great! We started with the Calamari appetizer, it was so good breaded and cooked perfectly! My husband had the Maryland Crabcake Benedict, and I had the Shrimp and Grits! Both dishes did not disappoint! I would highly recommend Dish Bar and Grill to family and friends!",

Although the restaurant was completely full and they were quite busy, both these ladies remained cool, calm and professional.

Always happy to visit: very friendly and efficient servers.   Food was good to excellent. Could be a bit pricey, but you\u2019re paying for the service and the ambiance and the quality. Very clean restaurant (bathrooms always super clean and fresh). IMPORTANT!!! Costa del Sol Rest. is CLOSED (they said TEMPORARILY) but I\u2019m afraid it will not reopen at least not with current owners (for more than 30 years). I hope I\u2019m wrong and they reopen.  It\u2019s been closed for a few months now; I just heard about this yesterday... VERY SAD. Can\u2019t believe it...",
   "I've never had paella before tonight, but I am a huge fan now.  For the quality and quantity of food, Costa del Sol is well priced.  The cava sangria was delightful as well.  For dessert, I had the almond torte was the perfect ending to a fine meal.  I look forward to going back!",
   "Looks like they're going to be closed for Good. Where do I go for paella now?",
   "Absolutely delicious food. The paellas are to die for. Highly recommend. Love the atmosphere they created and they keep the Spanish flair. The sangria although very delicious, tasted more like a juice rather than a alcoholic beverage. It was fine for me but those dining with he would have enjoyed a bolder sangria. Food is delicious you will love it!",

All you can eat buffet with plenty to choose from. And their meats right off the grill are superb. You get personal attention from The Grill Master and the price is not to be beat. All you can eat Plus BBQ for under $17. Beer and wine are served as well. I would go back there in a second... and probably will very often. Keep up the great work!",
   "This place is great. The food is great, every sing dish was cooked perfectly and had excellent flavour. Some of the best steak I've had anywhere in the Hartford area. Looks a little dumpy outside, but is a whole in the wall gem. Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and knowledgeable. Cook on the meat is perfect and the pricing is more than reasonable. Will be a repeat customer for a long time."

   "This small, clean, friendly restaurant located within the Hartford Regional Market is shockingly good!! I went there with a colleague today. I couldn't believe there was a restaurant in this location. Clean. Parking. Great burgers, fries, onion rings etc. All items were made to order but were exceptionally fast and very good. Great food. Great value. Definitely going back.",
   "Good food and a great price. It is in a location one wouldn\u2019t imagine a good place. Great hidden gem and they serve breakfast till 11.",
   "Brian and the staff at Market Restaurant have played a critical role in helping us grow our business.  They are the most professional, adaptable, responsive and thorough corporate catering team around.  I come from the world of catering management and have high expectations.  Market meets and exceeds my standards on a continual basis.  Our clients rave about the quality of the food and rightfully so.  If you're in the \"market\" for an excellent catering company, your search can end right here.",
   "Exceptional place to eat something when in a rush. Their customer service is efficient, pricing is convenient, great character. Will visit here again",

   "Our family settled on having Mexican Food recently and we met at Monte Alban for lunch. We had been there before - the lunch specials are very appealing and we settled on the Pork Burrito, Beef Burrito with extra onions, and Mole Enchiladas - each served with a Mexican Rice and Refried Beans with a dab of Corn Pudding. A side dish of a perfect Chicken Tamale started us off and it was all very delicious. We were full very satisfied very happy with the food and the service when we left! We will come again!!!",
   "Summary: Authentic Mexican restaurant serving all the classic fare such as tacos, burritos, and enchiladas with various meat options. The flavor of the food is more authentic than other Mexican restaurants and various meats are seasoned superbly. The restaurant is lively, especially during the summer, and the service is excellent.\n\nMust Try: Lengua burrito and tacos\nAlso Recommended: Gordita.\nAvoid: N/A\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - Great, worth a detour",
   "Monte Alban is one of the best smaller Mexican restaurants as I enjoy their authenticity (food, vibe, music), great/caring service each time I go. I have never been disappointed each time I have came here. Their chicken burrito dish is very fulling as it is tasty.",
   "two days ago was our first time in this good restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We had a good time with the attentive service, with the high quality  food and wine and with the comfortable payment. We will definitely go back there in a short time.",
   "Average neighborhood Mexican. Mole\nPoblano and tacos were very tasty, but the veggie burrito was missing flavor . The chicken in the chicken quesadilla was cooked to death"

As a foodie, it didn't take me long to realize how much J (Jordan) cares about the quality of each dish and the customer service provided by the servers and the bartenders. And yes this converted pizza place still serves great pizza but what is so impressive is how J restaurant continues to explore new tastes, new wines, and new cocktails. If you have not been there, make a point to go to stop in for dinner before or after a show at the Bushnell, see a show at the Arts Academy or just seek outstanding, gastronomical delights. You wont be sorry.",

I had the pleasure of working with them for a client's wedding and their catering was top notch! I highly recommend them. Kris & Jordan are awesome to work with - organized and on top of things. Exactly what you need in catering a special event!",

I'm not so impressed though.",

The food was absolutely sublime! The only thing was the peanut punch was kinda watery but I can\u2019t blame them for that. And the Johnny cake was good to...it wasn\u2019t hard to eat like big stone or nothing . Overall very good food and I will go back!",
   "The steam fish, with white rice is excellent, when freshly made...\n\nService is decent, and music is nice. \n\nWait times could be better, but their not serving burgers here. \n\nWould have given a 5, but had maybe one or two slip ups here after 7pm with this place. Seems they tend to not make anything fresh fish Wise after a certain time. \n\nAlso, it seems things are often not available, or they run out at times.\n\n"

I'd probably try one of their noodle dishes and steer clear of their sandwiches. Very well priced for a quick lunch. I could tell these people know what they're doing which is why I give 4 stars. Perhaps Banh mi just isn't my thing.",

   "King and I is a hidden gem. It is somewhat difficult to find in a busy street, recessed from the main frontage so that you can easily drive by it. Well worth looking for, though. Housed in a small building that was probably a private residence at some time, it is a cozy little room with no more than 10 or so tables. The food has a great, authentic, home-cooked ambience. As vegetarians, my wife and I often find it difficult to eat out and get a satisfactory meal. This is never been a problem at The King and I, since they can make almost any dish in a vegetarian version. We particularly like their Drunken Noodles. Probably the best Thai cuisine in the Greater Hartford area.",
   "Good service, clean, quick and fair prices. My downside was that massaman curry is by far one of the most popular Thai dishes in America -the one I tried didn't measure up. I tried others curry from so various cities and states but this one was disappointing in the proportions of the meat and vegetables. Taste was okay but lacking color. Above all it had almost no meat for the price I paid. The atmosphere in the place is very cozy, small and romanticish. I would go again to give them a second try with a different dish.",

   "I like this place and being there gives you a sense of eating at home. I ate traditional Thai fried rice with chicken and it was damn good. This tasted like authentic Thai food in the US like I had in Thailand. Also, I tried the ice Thai tea and it was okay. It tastes like cream and water with aroma of tea. However, I would rate 5 star for this place."

The location provides various authentic hotpot soup bases and fresh selection of meats and vegetables. Patrons can also design their own dipping sauces with many different savory options. All broths are excellent but the Chengdu hot and spicy soup is a must try for mala spice aficionados.\n\nMust Try: Chengdu hot and spicy soup and Chinese herbal daily soup.\nAlso recommended: Tomato based sour soup.\nAvoid: N/A\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - Outstanding, worth a special excursion",

We didn't feel like total noobs once we got our orders and were able to dive right in. My dinner companion and I both got the mini pot combos for around $20 each. Everything came out super quick. As you can see, the combo included the broth/soup base, 2 proteins, a raw egg, and a HUGE platter full of veggies, fried tofu, and glass noodles. Veggies were fresh, the meat was delicious, the broth though...wow wow wow. So flavorful!! \n\nStaff was very friendly and the place has a nice ambiance and vibe to it. I can't wait to go back. They definitely have gotten a regular customer out of me!"

An absolute MUST TRY for anyone looking to have a meatless meal without sacrificing taste! (and their desserts are absolutely divine as well!) The staff is super helpful, and the restaurant has a great vibe to it. The only thing to keep in mind is that it is a little small inside, so if you want to go with a large group you're better off getting everything to go. Also, they sometimes don't have the menu for the day written down anywhere so don't be afraid to ask the peraon working the counter what they have available for the day.",

It's a small place, with a few counter seats, so you may want to take it to go if your party has more than 2-3 people, but it's worth the trip! The menu varies daily. I've had 4 different tofu dishes, and somehow they make tofu delicious every time- that's some kind of magic. It's especially good if you like intense or spicy flavors."

   "This spot is my favorite. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this place I go the most. The team is very affectionate and the cooking they offer is so flavorful. I would always prefer to have a nice dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.",
   "Great place to hit before going to XL center. Quaint bar with upper and lower levels for seating. Menu has great selections and good portions.  The staff is very friendly and would definitely go there again when in town."

   "We went for Sunday Brunch and everyone really enjoyed what they had. Our server was very friendly and attentive. It was very busy so we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Enjoyed some pear ice tea and iced coffees while we waited. Only thing I didn't like was the section with \"regular tables\" was closed off so we had to sit at a high top which was challenging after undergoing hip surgery.",
   "Very cute tea shop selling both normal and alcoholic teas. Very interesting. It\u2019s just a little crowded at night time. There\u2019s a big night scene here.",
   "Friendly waitstaff. They had a vegan option for Saturday brunch. Nice music. I got there early (around 10 am) before the brunch crowd rolled in and it was pretty quiet. It got busier around noon. Fairly priced.",
   "I really enjoyed their food and customer service, excellent location nearby to my residence. The workers are always super nice. I highly recommend this place.",
   "Great food, great drink menu, indoor and outdoor seating, cozy and comfortable with wonderful friendly people. I came here alone on a Saturday night after moving to Hartford and met so many great people and had a fun time! I will certainly be back soon. \nThis place is popular with locals and is a must for anyone looking to meet friendly new people or just try great food. Also they had a great DJ starting around 11:30pm and they clear some tables out of the way for people to dance but have a separate section for large groups to sit and eat where you won\u2019t be in the middle of the dance floor. Basically, they have everything covered, despite being such a small place. Enjoy your visit!"

As it was our first time, the waiter offered suggestions for sharing dishes and it so delivered. So good. We will definitely return when in the area again. Love the Bibimbop at this place. Great service and reasonably priced. The sushi is also very good. Seems a popular spot in the West End of Hartford. Definitely recommend.",
   "A great place with great prices! The staff was really attentive and the food was plentiful for the cost. They gave so many free appetizers when we came from fried fish to soups. This is a great place to come if you're looking to spend a little bit eating out in Hartford.",
   "So far there best sushi I've had in the 5 months I've lived here. Nice atmosphere. Place was super quiet, which made it easy to carry on a conversion. Service staff was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back.\n\nParking lot is a bit tight, so keep that in mind if you drive a large vehicle.",
   "First time eating here. Found it from a Groupon promotion which we had no trouble redeeming. Menu has many options, many of which we were unfamiliar with. Our waitress was helpful in explaining everything.\n\nWe received several appetizers while waiting on our meal, including lotus root which none of us had ever had before. It was quite tasty! Also the steamed dumplings were incredible. I've had dumplings before but these were so tender!\n\nThe portions of the meal were very generous and the food was delicious. We had a stonepot bibimbap, teriyaki steak and a sushi sampler. All the food was prepared perfectly. The sizzle on the bibimbap was particularly impressive as the egg in the pot cooks at the table from the residual heat of the stoneware bowl.\n\nWith an impressive array of delicious options on the menu, this is definitely a restaurant we will be returning to.",
   "Food is always hot, fresh and delicious! They have both Japanese and Korean entrees including sushi. I have never been disappointed eating here and the service is always very attentive. I find it a challenge to pick something off the menu because it's pretty endless.  This place is a diamond in the rough. Looking forward to my next visit!"

My cousin and aunt come here frequently. The staff treat them as family, not customers. The food portions are massive, prepare to take some home and have a delicious meal the next day. The bread served with the meal really compliments each dish. They have a great menu and even accommodate for veggie and vegans.",

   "There is so much food you have to take some home. It's as good as my mother's who cooked these same dishes for over 60 years and came through Ellis Island. It's a comfortable atmosphere, no stuffy waiters. You want something, then ask, you get it. The quality of the food is perfect and the prices are very reasonable. You want to drop 300 on a fancy place then go.",
   "We had a party of nine people. We had four appetizers, nine entrees, their most expensive bottle of red (Sterling), and other beverages and the bill was around $200.00. What a bargain! The restaurant is unpretentious and the service is very relaxed, great if you want to relax and not in a hurry. The food was very good. It was very quiet.",

   "Summary: For the price and quality, Broasterant may serve the best fried chicken in the Hartford area. The fried chicken is consistently juicy and seasoned perfectly. The chicken plate is also accompanied by a mountain of french fries and dinner roll. The owner is very friendly and the service is excellent.\n\nMust Try: Fried chicken plate or any other size.\nAlso recommended: Shrimp and fries plate.\nAvoid: N/A\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - Great, worth a detour",
   "Best chicken I ever tasted beside Popeyes but Popeyes better watch out because they have competition because Broasterant have chicken to die for.

We also got a side of guac that was really good and definitely enough to take to go",
   "More take out out oriented than eat in (although there are tables. Unfortunately they didn't take orders by phone but are quite quick to \"assemble\" an order. They have a unique colelction of chicken, vegetable and rice plates plus a varity of greens. I've been twice and wasn't disappointed. I research various cuisines and cook (as a hobby),so I am always interested in new ways to present standard fare, such as chicken and vegetables in this instance. I would highly recommend the charred broccoli and crispy Brussels sprouts, neither of which is usually not a go-to for many palates, but they are good.",

The food here is amazing and you really can't go wrong with anything.  Another tip, they have an awesome catering menu.  Definitely give them a call if you are hosting a party!",

I tried the \"Almost Legal\", a rice bowl loaded with flavorful toppings such as plantains, grilled corn, pickled onions and more!  Every bite was delicious!  The location is great, the atmosphere is inviting, and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  Loved it!"

Georges got good reviews. We were glad we went. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone. My sister got a turkey grinder (sub or hero) and I got the grilled chicken sandwich, fries, and a slice of pizza. We both got sodas too. The food was delicious and service was friendly and speedy. The bill came to about $21! We were very pleased and will go back again.",

The prices are very good, and there's a good amount of parking, although this place can get busy at times, and it's about average in terms of. It's a little bit older of a restaurant in terms of decor.\n\nEverybody will find something they like here. This place has been around for a very long time, and after you've eaten a meal here, you'll understand why.",

The waitress was asked for a few plates to eat cake on. Once they  had taken our plates that we used for the pizza and small plates were provided the manager informed the waitress that we had to be charged for each individual plate. We were so disappointed that we left and will never go back.  We spent close to $100 and after you take our plates you want to charge us for small ones. I've never ever experienced that before."

You\u2019ll see when you get here!\nWorth the money?- Yes: The meal was fantastic and the portions were massive.",
   "I really liked this place, but I ordered the wrong dish for my first experience. My chicken and waffles were not great. Most of the chicken had bones, and was extra crispy. So, I could not easily cut bites of chicken with the waffle below. I ate the chicken separately from the waffle but that is not really how that dish is designed. The stuffed French toast was very good, my daughter liked it immensely. The place had very little parking so I worried about a long wait but it is huge inside. We were seated immediately at some high top tables. Cute salt and pepper shakers and the whole place was very cozily decorated. I will try the eggs Benedict options or the breakfast quesadillas. We will be back and I expect a 5 star experience.",

The food is always delicious but in this instance there were several things missing. Mind you I made the order at 3:38. It was supposed to be at my house by 4:35 give or take a few minutes. I called at 4:55 and they said it was on it's way, which fine, no problem. When it finally came, I was missing my grinder, muffin, and both french toast had no whip cream. I had to resort to going to the corner store to get myself something to eat. So yeah, I'm extremely annoyed considering how much money I spent, how long i waited, and how hungry I was. DISSATISFIED to the max!"

   "The place was great for Valentine's dinner...the wait staff, the people, and the owner (Catarina?) were so nice, and the food was good. A very nice, fun group at the separated bar area as well. We were nicely impressed and will be back!",
   "This is precisely where the local ethnic Portuguese Crowd Goes to eat. Authentic Native Food and Portuguese spoken almost exclusively. It rates high in my book compared to the few other authentic Portuguese restaurants in the area. Food and service were great. Everybody was friendly and you would think everybody is back in their native country at the local eating establishment. If you want to get a sense of what it would be like to eat at a local Portuguese Pub in Lisbon , this is the place!!!",
   "Great food.  Casual atmosphere.   Friendly people.   Its like walking into a Portuguese cheers.   Lol",
   "Great food.  Nice servers"

   "Had dinner here on a week day evening with co-workers a few weeks ago. The service was excellent and food were delicious and the price was very reasonable. My guests enjoyed their time here. The fried calamari was delicious. I told someone about my experience a few weeks later and it was a different experience. I had the drinks for the first time and they were terrible. My soup was cold which didn\u2019t make sense because the place was empty. I will not be going back. I do not recommend this experience.",
   "Great bar & restaurant. Pleasant and comfortable. It feels like your neighborhood restaurant & bar. We ate a range of appetizers at the bar and enjoyed every one of them. Prices are quite reasonable given the high quality of the food. I'll be back.",
   "Although the staff was friendly and gave us what we asked for, there was a timeliness that was missing. The restaurant was not full and yet it was a long while after ordering before we got out food.  The food was good but not outstanding. One thing I believe is missing is handmade dressings?  We asked if their chicken tenders were fresh or frozen and they were the latter.  Why not cook from scratch? That\u2019s what the consumer expects now.  The Cobb salad I got was very good and my husband\u2019s chicken wings were good. The other thing that made our visit less than great was that the temperature of the restaurant was too cold!  Who wants to be cold when dining out.  All in all unremarkable and not place we will be anxious to visit again. .",
   "Ordered the Thai Salad with Blackened Salmon and thai dressing.....I'm in love with this salad, had it 3 times in the last week. Perfectly blended. Always fresh and delicious.",
   "Hickory burger was delicious! But I'm so upset i forgot to take a picture of the nachos! Those are the best nachos I've ever had. We ordered the half size and it was more than enough for 5 adults and 2 children. Our waitress Thalia if i remember correctly was very nice and kept checking up on us. Not average checking up on us... like above average checking up on us. Can't wait to go back. Pricing was also great for the quality of food you get. Everyone go check it out. You wont be disappointed!"

   "I was recommended this restaurant a week ago and they told me that the chicken wings and seafood are very good.  I decided to try Saturday night. I Order to take out i wait nine minutes on the phone so they could attend me, i order chicken wings, sweet potato, fried squid and fried onion rings but the ladies  forgot to order the onion rings.  They told me between 20 and 25 minutes to pick up.  I entered at 19 minutes later.  The restaurant was super full, there were more than 10 groups waiting, they delivered the order to me within 24 minutes very well, many people left did not want to wait.  Now let's talk about the food, the chicken wings were well cooked a little dry very little sauce, the sweet potatoes were well cooked but saggy for the packaging they use and the squids were very good well seasoned but also very saggy for the packaging they use  and onion rings for next time.  I know that the restaurant was very crowded, I am proud to see that Hartford has an opportunity for small businesses.  When i comments regarding a place it is not to hurt but it is to help correct the small problems that occur at the moment.  It's a good restaurant I don't know the owners just need to be more organized and better managed.  I know it's hard but they have a goldmine in their hands Good luck God bless you.  I will return with my family to enjoy their dishes.",
   "The food is filled with flavor. Our server was Michelle she was great. The price was worth it,  I will definitely be coming back.",
   "It was very good I cannot complain we all enjoyed our food very well seasoned very fresh. We were all so very full. I will most definitely make this a regular stop on my visit to Connecticut anytime I come back. And I most definitely would recommend\" Chosen 1 Cajun Seafood.\" The only thing I would change is the chairs not very comfortable at all but I guess they're easy to wipe down \ud83d\ude43 also if you have a large group like we did get the shovel and add some bags",
   "4.5 Stars.\nFood was enjoyable. Seasoned seafood is always enjoyable. The actually seafood ( crabs, shrimp, scallops, clams) seemed fresh and well prepared. We had the spade (serves 4) and it's adequate depending on appetite. \nWill visit again.\n\nCheers.",
   "So DELICIOUS. Our waitress was great. Some of the best seafood I've ever had. A must try! I highly recommend. The prices are competitive. Restaurant was clean."

   "Best bodega spot in town! I go here every morning for my bacon, egg, cheese on a toasted roll. Can't complain about the portion size.",
   "Pretty small but quaint restaurant located at the intersection of Broad and Park Streets. There are about 3 small tables with chairs, as well as a long counter with bar stools facing Broad Street where you can sit and dine. The young man serving behind the food counter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the different types of food he was selling. The food was very good and filling as expected, if you're used to Puerto Rican foods. There was also a variety of dessert options. The place was clean on the inside and I was very impressed when I saw an older gentleman who obviously works at the restaurant (He was wearing a t-shirt with the name on it), sweeping the sidewalk and the streets outside the restaurant and picking up the trash. Bravo! I would definitely recommend this place based on my experience, and based on the amount of patrons that came in to pick up food while I was there, I guess others feel the same way too.",

It is a very special night! I loved it!!! I\u2019ll be back!"

   "Quite possibly the most conflicted review I've ever done. On the one hand, the value is tremendous -- you get a LOT of food at a very reasonable price. On the other hand, the \"potluck\" nature of it, overall bland taste, and the presentation/store ambiance leave more than a little to be desired. I'll be generous and go 4-stars. The curry soy pieces are easily the best part of this \"sampler\" I photographed. The rest of it? It reminds me of military slop, with a Jamaican/vegan twist. Worth a try though and, again, the value is definitely there.",
