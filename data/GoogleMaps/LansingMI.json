   "This place is wonderful! Located in a beautiful area right on the river trail. Admission is very affordable and we had a blast even though some of the animals were inside for the winter.",
   "Perfect little zoo day! My son picked Potter Zoo for his birthday outing. He Spent the day exploring animals and riding the train with family and friends. He explored the gift shop and managed to con us into ice cream mid afternoon. He loved the petting area and the horse ride! (Which made for the best photos) He enjoyed watching the monkeys and even rolling down the entrance hill. Would definitely recommend for littles!",
   "We had the good fortune to visit this nice little Zoo last weekend.\n\nAs a lifetime animal lover, I generally prefer smaller zoos. Although they don't have as much as larger zoos, you can usually get closer to the animals.\n\nThis zoo is set in a beautiful wooded area. There's plenty of parking and even on a Saturday afternoon, it was never crowded, which is a great selling point.\n\nOur favorite exhibit was the Tamarinds. Small white topped monkeys with some babies. Adorable, although I didn't get any pictures of them.\n\nThe otter was a lot of fun too, swimming back and forth to the delight of us all. The lions, although napping through the heat of the day were beautiful. The rhinoceros is a very majestic creature. \n\nExceptionally pleasant day visiting such a nice zoo.",
   "A hidden gem of the Lansing area, amazing large zoo with lots of unique and exciting animals! Great location for a date",
   "Small family friendly zoo with some big animals. There a great selection of animals from amphibians to tigers a great place. We went for the lights in December awesome experience."

   "This place was very educational, very clean and contained a ton of information and items. My only issue, if I had to be picky would be navigating all the floors. Not all elevators took you to all floors, and we didn't see any signs directing us to a different elevator for the other content. We missed the top floor because the elevator we were at didn't seem to take us there and we didn't know where the other one was. I have a knee injury and the stairs weren't an option that day. Small signs might be useful to navigate. I didn't notice any if there were any. Gift store was also really well put together. Thank you for having us!!",
   "MHC is well organized!  I have lived in Michigan all my life and there is plenty of history I do not know about. AMAZING!!! It is for ALL ages!!!",
   "This is a true gem in the Lansing area.  I have grown up going to this museum as often as I could and I still go whenever I get a chance.  Every time I visit I see something new.  Whether it's an ever changing special exhibit or just letting the permanent displays take you back in time to when Michigan was number one in all the land, this place has something for everyone.  Please take a trip if you have never been or if you have go back.  It's well worth any drive you have to make and it's free!",
   "I always have a blast... I have been going there since I was really little. And now I have brought all of children there, youngest love and she's only 3 years old.",

   "If it\u2019s a fresh snow be prepared to wait, definitely worth it though. They give you a group number and when they call your number you get 2 hours on the hill. Bring cards/games for the wait, they have picnic tables inside and it\u2019s heated. No walking up the hill they have a motorized lift!! SO FUN!!",
   "One of the beautiful place to walk in summer. Quiet place and has lot of trails to walk and bike. Kids have play area. Adults can play volleyball and barbecues. Good play for picnics in summer. During winter you can find tube sliding.",
   "Beautiful area for a simple stroll around the lake and in the forest as well as for its summer and winter activities. There is something for everyone here, from the swimming /splash park for the little ones in the summer to the tube rides on the snow in the winter, complete with a dog park and covered picnic tables. Plenty of parking and the regular entry fee for Lansing's parks, 3$ for Ingham county residents.",
   "Had a great time at Hawk Island! Had to wait in the lodge for roughly 2 hours, so be prepared for that. But when its your turn, you get 2 hours of unlimited sledding, and tubes are included. Will be going back again next year!",
   "It's definitely a typical township park worth to try if you are nearby. Free if you're biking but some fees apply coming by car. Splash Park and wooden playground are well built and kept. You  an bring your own food but concessions are available. With exception of the beach, there are plenty of shaded areas but not so many trees. You can rent a kayak or bring your own too."

Several models on display and the boys enjoyed walking about looking at the cars and at least a couple of trucks as well.  We went on a Saturday late morning/early afternoon and there wasn't too many people here.",

   "A great place to explore and discover. There are lots of hands-on demonstrations and activities for kids to try out, each offering a fun and intuitive introduction to a scientific concept.\n\nI don't know that the features rotate or get updated often, so it's not likely a place to return to frequently. But I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't been before.\n\nA downside to many locations in this area is that lunch options can be sparse on the weekends.",

   "Early Morning Snow Burst during the walk. Took the longest Route to enjoy the serenity. Seen several deer watching us.",

Hey have docents there that when I bring my students on a field trip they have many activities to help each age level. The Apple Butter Festival is for family and individuals. Which is a must-do. I also love the maple syrup Festival. You must come and walk amongst the trees. Go to the observation room and look at the birds being fed with all of the different bird feeders. See the lovely bees buzzing and an actual window into the hive is quite an attraction for young and old. They also have feathers and different species to show to the visitors.",

It's this wonderful freshwater lake stocked with fish with an accessible kayak launch and a challenging trail around it. Bring your camera! If the light is just right, the trees on the far side of the lake are mirrored in the water and it's just lovely! Try accessing Crego Park from the River Trail, too! The back way in is much more scenic.",

   "A very quiet park in the middle of the city. While this park is pretty well attended with children, families and seniors walking, its well.maintained and has a very nice flower area.  It Was a nice place to just sit , relax , talk and play a game. Most enjoyable time",
   "The park is a lovely escape for anybody who is a nature lover.",
   "The colorful Adirondack chairs you can place for your preference, beauty, mature trees, uncrowded, clean ...\nThe swings are perfect!! Wide enough, high enough for this bike riding granny to remember being a kid and make a good summer 2019 memory in Lansing",
   "I'm glad that it is well maintained and hope that it remains for many,many years to come.",
   "Very nice place in the summertime plenty of trees around to shade you very comfortable in the springtime and very comfortable in the very cold in the winter time"

   "I enjoyed a self guided tour of the Michigan State Capitol building yesterday and cannot wait to go back!! This building is a treasure within Lansing that should be seen by everyone! It is free to tour and an incredible experience in itself!! The pictures will not do this building justice!! Go see it as soon as you can!!!",
   "Almost a personal tour on the day we visited.  We were here collecting another stamp for the boys passports (all State capitals). We arrived just before the tour started and were the only ones when it started (late afternoon on a Friday). \nAlways like the tours as you get more info and history about the capital and state. For instance, it's easy to b forget that Michigan was once on a border with an enemy (war of 1812) and the capital was Detroit at that time and had been captured. \nWe had a good time moving about the capital building and learning as we moved along.",
   "A wonderful place to watch  how laws are made and society is ran. Also a goldmine for Michigan History,  which we all love.",
   "In my opinion, the most beautiful building in Lansing. When I arrived the whole city seemed dead. Cool stop if you are passingg through, but i would not make Lansing a getaway place for the weekend"

The climber for the kids keeps them occupied for a bit, but the big wheeler track needs a ton of attention. The first time we found the track there were very few big wheelers to use, almost all were broken. I brought my son back with his own and he rode for a while, but quickly, other kids wanted turns. Although I believe in turns, it took long enough that it was time enough where we had to leave and had trouble getting the big wheeler back. The next two years we went back and it's worse and worse,  there is carnage of broken big wheelers and tricycles all over. I wish something could be done because this is the only track I know of in this community.",

   "A beautiful paradise amidst the city! We visited when the peonies were in full bloom (mid-June) and it was stunning. We were amazed at the number of peonies and there were bridal parties taking pictures everywhere. We also walked one of the trails and enjoyed the lush beauty. There are a few main trails, but also many smaller offshoot trails that were fun to explore. I would definitely visit here again if I am ever in Ann Arbor.",
   "It's a beautiful place nice for relaxing and enjoying the nature. I love it",
   "This place is fantastic! Awesome scenery and most things are labeled. Venue is open to the public and is great for family outings and picnics, too! Unfortunately, this is a pet free park (which totally makes sense), but it's definitely worth a visit, for sure!\nI loved the scenery! Great job to the staff, students, and volunteers!",
   "This has grown a lot, beautiful place for senior pictures!",
   "Delightful.  Surprising number of flowers in bloom for early November."

   "I was blown away by the level of care provided by Dr. Taunt and his office. I had a full knee replacement and he was wonderful. So far I\u2019m 2 weeks post surgery and the level of care remains. Any and all questions have been answered promptly and the day of surgery, he personally came to check on me before and after multiple times. MULTIPLE TIMES! I\u2019ve never had a doctor do that !!! I would highly recommend !!! I\u2019ll be back for my other knee soon :)",
   "I had a partial knee replacement elsewhere and had pain for years.  I went to see Dr. Taunt and he said it should be replaced \u201cwhen I was ready\u201d.  He wanted me to decide when it was time.  I was totally impressed and sold on him again as I had seen him before.  Finally I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and went back and was scheduled for surgery 11/5/19.  Because of his brilliantly made \u201cHealth Loop\u201d\u2019that sent you messages and reminded you each day what to do (start exercising before surgery, when to stop your supplements, etc.) I was lead each day with what to do before the surgery.  It was so informative and even had a one minute video of a knee replacement....very simply showing the knee bones and what would be done.  It took all my fears away and I looked forward to my next day\u2019s Health Loop every day!  It was truly amazing and continued for almost a month after surgery asking great questions so he knew how your progress was going.  I would never go anywhere else when it\u2019s time for my left knee.  He is an amazing doctor!! He would be my number one recommendation for a knee replacement!",
   "Outstanding pre surgery infection prevention. Knee replacement is healing quickly and feels great. Doctor and his staff used a communication portal daily and any questions are responded to quickly. Came highly recommended by other medical professionals and did not disappoint.",
   "I am a Surgical Nurse of 24 years, Dr Charles J. Taunt Jr, DO  is the surgeon I recommend.  He continues to  always look for  ways to improve his outcomes for his patients. He is the Best! He has given me a new beautiful  Right Total Knee replacement October 2019. My experience  has been amazing and I am very pleased with my out come. He also gave my husband Bilateral  Total Knee replacements in 2016 and 2017.  We are both very active and very grateful that we have such a talented Orthopedic Surgeon.",
   "The expertise and compassionate care of Dr. Taunt and his team were exceptional.  It made all the difference in the world with my total hip replacement, something I was very nervous going into.  The GetWell Loop portal, so they can check in with you and you with them every day, is a bonus!"

   "This is a large state park that seems intended primarily for camping, boating, and horseback riding. There are several trails with sporadic trail markers provided. The sole reason for my visit was to explore trails on foot, hoping to admire wildflowers, observe (wild) animal habitats, and take some photos. The trail markers at this very rural park play a critical role in keeping horses off of pedestrian trails. There was ample evidence (\ud83d\udca9) to suggest that the trail signs are not always successful in doing so. While this park has a lot to offer, I prefer other great parks in Michigan for their natural landscapes and scenic interest.",
   "Great place to spend the day. The fishing was great, swimming was fun. They have geocaches in a few places of the park. There is frisbee golf course which was mostly shaded. The park is open until 10pm. The restrooms are clean and there was ample parking. They also have a dog beach.",
   "A nice campground conveniently located off exit 105 on Interstate 69. Clean bath houses and generally nice campsites. Spaces 1-100 will be closed through July 31st due to an electrical upgrade.\n\nThe downside is the dump as there's only 2 positions to dump for 228 campsites. Be ready to wait!",

There are some steep hills though, so wear good shoes. The pond has a small beach area, but not much shoreline that is able to be utilized. \n\n-The Beachnut Trail offers historical explanations of the place with a few remnants of what used to be. Has a pretty tall bridge with a high view of the woods around you.   \n\n-Deer Run trail is a favorite. Walking through the woods with the Grand River flowing right beside you. Great private place to take the dog for a dip. \n\n-Prairie Loop is the most mellow of the trails being made up of grass. \n\n-Tallman Trails seems to be the least traveled and is my favorite. Great views of the pond and Grand River. Plus a view of the dam. On this trial you can access trails not displayed on the map. If you dare to take them you\u2019ll find some interesting rocks and a cute waterfall.",

Sam is extremely knowledgeable about his profession and takes pride in being able to help his patients get back mobility in whatever extremity needs work, and range of motion. He ensures you are completing the exercises correctly by modeling the exercises and then watching as you complete them to safeguard against injury. He explains how the exercise will benefit your body, and what areas it will strengthen. Lately, Sam has had some assistants working with him, and he is a wonderful mentor as well. He explains to them how he works with his patients, and has his assistants explain to him what they would do by engaging them in open ended questions. Lastly, Sam does this all with a sense of humor! When you have to have therapy, you might as well enjoy it, and I have had the opportunity to laugh a few times over his sense of humor!",

Sam by far is the most caring, thoughtful, and knowledgeable person who helps you with encouraging words and explanations how different exercises help your situation. He is kind,respectful, patient and listens to your concerns. Best in town.",

He changed up his plans for the day, based on how I felt day to day. He still pushed me to work hard, and praised me when I met goals. I will be coming back to Sam if I ever need therapy again. \nAnd if you read this Sam, thank you and thank you to your staff."

There is not a ton to see in the castle but what you do see is filled with information on this guy's life and the numerous books he wrote that influenced over 200 movies.  Make sure you walk around the grounds and take the short walk to see where he actually lived as well. The art museum nextdoor is also worth a visit."

   "Whenever we're heading anywhere in Michigan, my 4 year old has to come to Kids 'N' Stuff. Michigan is now officially the Kids 'N' Stuff State. \n\nThere are so many options for any kid to enjoy themselves, if only for an hour while passing through. Adults can have fun, too!\n\nIf you're in the area I can't recommend this place enough, your kids/grandkids/nieces/nephews, etc. will love it."

   "I took my 1 year old son here a few times this past month. We've never been to a \"play place\" before so it was a completely new experience for us. We stay for about 2 hours and have lunch there. the food was good. it wasn't too busy for us so it was great for our first time. I love the fact that I could go in the play scape with him. Total I spend less than $20. my only grief would be that there is only a hand dryer in the family bathroom. I dont mind using it as it it's a good one, but my son didnt like it and freaked out and started crying. Otherwise the place is always clean and the staff is friendly.",
   "I was so thrilled with this place. Great prices, clean facility, and most importantly, a friendly caring staff. I've been to other indoor play places closer to me where the staff spends more time gossiping than working. Not here! Staff is on it and gently enforces rules, which made me super happy. The games were affordable, between .25 and 2.00. The food was a little on the pricey side, but! They had good size portions and the food was super tasty. My five year old had a blast and is begging to go back. My one year old enjoyed having a toddler area where she couldn't get trampled by big kids. I guess maybe it'd be cool to have one other bounce castle for smaller kids, but I'm not complaining.",
   "Absolutely the worst display of hospitality I've ever experienced. We called in the morning to get hours they were open. After being given information, we drove 30 min through the snow for my autistic sons birthday. When we got there and paid, we were kicked out after 20 minutes, so they could close and setup for a party...as if they needed to set up the 4 story play structure. Absolutely not happy paying $40/he to let my son have his birthday activity ruined.\n\nUpdate...the manager apologized and offered free passes for a return.",
   "Love taking my grandkiddos here. We spend lots of play time making memories and eating pizza!  Reasonable rates and clean atmosphere",
   "Very clean, great prices, and plenty to keep 7, 5 and 3 year old busy."

   "We came here for an all bldg outing and were not disappointed!   We went on the tour and the staff got a vehicle that could accommodate us all,  wheelchair spaces as well.   There was a long line but they did not rush or make us feel as though we were a burden.   It was great!   We ate lunch at the picnic area just outside the attraction,  and after walked through the park.   It was very cool!   We found another picnic area much larger and off the main path,  wishing we had eaten there...  We bought some lettuce and carrots for the camel's and giraffe's.  It was time for us to head back before we got all the way through,  but saw most of it. Maybe another time,  worth every penny.   I wish we could get a business membership!   If I were an animal,  I believe I would be very happy here\ud83d\udc95",
   "Seeing all of the animals was super awesome and you can tell they are well taken care of.  The staff is all friendly and my favorite part was how close you can get to the kangaroo. However, feeding a giraffe is a close second. It\u2019s really a self led safari, which my boyfriend and I prefer. Don\u2019t miss out on going on the free safari ride around the bigger sections of the park. The staff make it enjoyable and you see how huge the park actually is. Definitely would come back!",
   "What an amazing place!  My son asked me to give a review because he wanted to support this park.  The staff are very friendly and informed.  One of the workers gave us great insight into the uniqueness of the animals.  One of kangaroos would let me pet it and then it tried to box me.  The staff informed that it is an aggressive female but is very friendly.  That was helpful to know. : )\n\nAlso, the Animal Encounter is worth it!  We were able to see up close three different animals and pet them.  There was a 1-year old in our group and it was so funny to see how the baby reacted to the fox, kangaroo and lizard.",
   "While it is fairly obvious to me, they are just a beginning \"zoo\", others there seemed to be impressed. Most displays are pretty small and not well \"decorated\". You are able to get fairly close to most small animals so you are able to look closely at the animals. Will I take my soon to be born great grandchild there in a couple years? You bet. I will also try to take he/she to much larger zoos when he/she is older so animals can be seen in more natural settings. No I don't know the gender of my grandchild to be born in October, and my granddaughter is being very tight lipped about it. Works for me. I like surprises.",
   "Love the zoo. You can tell the animals are happy and well taken care of. Even the ones you cannot touch are social, playing with the kids from the windows. The zoo smells clean, and not like animals and the store is fun and affordable for the most part. We will definitely be attending future events again."

The service was good and friendly. The bathrooms are kept nicely cleaned. I was very impressed with the ambiance, seems like a great place for a romantic date.",
   "Hands down Deluca's is the best pizza in Lansing. The toppings are all the real deal, not out of a can. I've been eating their pizza for 32 years and the recipe hasn't changed for good reason. I can't speak so much for the other Italian entree's there, although, people I know enjoy everything on the menu. As long as I live in Lansing I'll continue to enjoy their great pizza!",

And they didn't add the broccoli which I didn't realize until after I left. Wasn't that impressed with my desert of choice either (cannoli.) But server Mary 15 was absolutely AWESOME! Very sweet woman!",

The best part, their prices are almost unbelievable low for the amount and type of food you get. It's unreal. The only \"down\" side is the wait. Be prepared to wait when you eat there. The wait is almost always between 30-90 minutes.

   "Incredible food. Absolutely amazing. Local meat, excellent flavors.\n\nAnd yet the poor rating. Why?\n\nBecause they can't keep food in stock.\n\nThere's zero excuse to pop in on a Saturday at 7pm and they're out of food for the night. And this is constant. Often it doesn't matter how early you get there if it's a bit after they've opened. Out of food.\n\nThe only time you can go is the middle of the week at five or six. Any time after that and God forbid a weekend, you're screwed.\n\nI understand it's difficult to keep the fresh meat, but maybe figure out how to before you open a new dining room you apparently can't serve.",

They were nice and customized it for me with toppings from another menu item. How could you not add bourbon banana fosters to it? \nTheir servings are large and filling and they have some really fun sandwich options and I drooled over the loaded fries. \nEverything is made from scratch and cooked right in front of you. \nWhen I return to Michigan this is definitely going to be one of my first places to hit for a sandwich to go and hit the river trail. \nOne of the tastiest places I've ever been and a hidden gem.",

   "Every dish was unique and delicious. And wonderful service with a smile.",
   "Very delicious food. Very friendly and hard working family. The place looks a little run down on the outside but very nice and clean on the inside.",
   "Firstly, this place is authentic and you can taste the fresh ingredients. You may wait a little but for your food, but freshly cooked food is top quality. \nThe food is excellent, just the right amount of spice. You grab a menu and seat yourself and a server will come take your order. It's a welcoming environment. I would definitely recommend this place, you won't be disappointed!",
   "If there\u2019s anything Lansing has that Chicago doesn\u2019t it\u2019s AMAZING Burmese food! I\u2019ve been wishing for great Burmese food in the Midwest for years, and this place is it. I had the Burmese fried rice and vermicelli Burmese soup, and both were outstanding. Hot, fresh, flavorful \u2014 all you can ask for from an authentic family-owned restaurant. Ssooo good. Definitely coming back on my next visit to Lansing.",
   "The hospitality, the service, the cleanliness all top notch.  The food is good, very tasty, but the location leaves a lot to be desired.  You get a large amount food for the cost.  Certainly worth the price."

   "Went for Thanksgiving Day Buffet. Was sadly disappointed. Green Bean casserole- green beans were way way too crunchy! The Dressing/Stuffing - the carrots were crunchy!! Not even cooked. Foods were warm to cold and then when trying the Apple crisp for dessert, they couldn't even bother to cook that long enough for the apples to cook all the way through as they were crunchy too. Just a very crunchy meal today. Not what I expected when paying almost $150 for a descent Holiday meal out.  Very disappointed for such a high end restaurant.",
   "Service was great but honestly....For the price, if you can handle a grill or a cast iron pan you're 100% better off making a steak at home or honestly just going somewhere more middle of the road cost wise. It didnt feel romantic or private. Just not what I expected for a steak over $100(there are cheaper options)",
   "Recently ate dinner to celebrate our anniversary. They were very accommodating, including a table card, flowers and complementary champagne. The appetizer, entree and dessert were all very nicely prepared and tasted delicious. Our waiter Andy was the perfect combination of professional and personal. Upscale, yet casual environment. Nice selection of wine, alcohol and mixed drinks.",
   "This is a high end restaurant, with clean and neat contemporary decor and white linen table cloths.  It\u2019s got a sizable menu and a series of beef selections that will keep you full for a week.  I ordered a couple of Old Fashions before dinner that were mixed well and included the Luxardo cherries and large single ice cubes that demonstrate a more sophisticated bar.  The drink portions were a bit light.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing better than having a hot bowl of French Onion Soup, but I\u2019ve tasted better.  There was a strong sage flavor that needed to be dialed back.  The steaks tasted pretty good and were quality cuts of meat.\n\nThe main dining area was a bit chopped up because of the floor plan, but they have a neat bar area with dining seating as an option too.  If there was a down side, it was the price.  We had a party of four, soups and salads, but no appetizers, no desserts and only two alcoholic beverages between us and the bill was nearly $250.  \n\nCapital Prime is a nice restaurant for a work function to entertain clients, but it\u2019s not a place you\u2019d go often on your own because of the price.",
   "Excellent customer service, delicious food! If you\u2019ve got $$ to spend & want a delicious meal, this is the place. The quality of the seafood is amazing \ud83d\ude0b I didn\u2019t take any pics because I ate it too fast."

The prices are a little high though, I bought the Americana dish and there was mostly potatoes on the dish, which I didnt appreciate, so that is why I took off 1 star. The sauce was good though.

   "Wow this place did not match the hype. I\u2019ve lived in the area for a few years and have heard good things from various groups about Golden Harvest. Which is surprising considering the expectation that the customer has to stand outside until they\u2019re allowed to come in. To be fair, if you\u2019re solo or in a group of 2 you probably won\u2019t have the experience of a group of 3+. We waited outside for 50 minutes in 35 degree weather. After being sat for 20 minutes we mentioned to our server that we were ready to order to which he replied \u201coh well actually how this is works is you place your order when I\u2019m ready to take your order\u201d while he overfilled my coffee without an apology or cleaning it up. After our order was submitted we waited an hour and 45 minutes to receive our food. We watched 4 groups who sat after us eat and pay before we received our food. 10 minutes before our order was brought out we asked if it was almost ready since no employees had approached our table to acknowledge the wait, the same server replied \u201cthe food takes a minute, this isn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s... we tell people an hour outside and then an hour inside\u201d once the food was brought to the table we were bombarded with questions of hospitality that most restaurants, even McDonald\u2019s, would\u2019ve given during our nearly 2 hr inside wait for food. I could see this place being enjoyable if you\u2019re treated like a valued customer, but unfortunately it seems hit or miss. Having a short staff creates problems with fast turn around obviously, but to avoid a table because you don\u2019t value their time is a choice of attitude. I\u2019ve only given a few reviews in my life and it\u2019s usually when the service is abnormal. Maybe others will have better luck or experiences. This was easily the worst and only \u201cthree hour\u201d dining experience I\u2019ve had in years.",
   "You can have uniqueness without being literally dusty and dirty. I understand there is supposed to be a rustic old garage type feel, that\u2019s cool, but still clean it. Also, not everyone wants to have to sit with a complete stranger at a very small table of four just because of your lack of seating. I bumped elbows with someone my entire meal. The food, itself, was good. Not bad, not great. The staff was in no way attentive, and only visited my table once within the hour wait I had after ordering. This is not including the hour wait outside just to get in, hoping to receive this \u201cexperience\u201d that has been raved about, that I was still, at this point, excited about, until I walked in the door. All of the bad definitely outweighed the one \u201cgood\u201d (the food. Not bad, not great). Based off your name and the good reviews that you do have, don\u2019t get too humble to take criticism. No one is above their customers feedback. Treat your customers better, at the least.",
   "Don't get me wrong, Golden Harvest is very good. I'm just not sure it's \"wait in line for an hour after arriving an hour before opening on a weekday in the winter\" good. I did really enjoy it the few times I've managed to go, but I'm just not dedicated enough for it with any regularity.",
   "I don\u2019t usually post reviews but this was the worst I\u2019ve ever been treated by staff members at a restaurant anywhere.. not only did it take 2.5 hours for breakfast food (eggs) to arrive for our table of four, one staff member told us he would not apologize for the delay because \u201che doesn\u2019t apologize to anyone for anything.\u201d When we told the cashier we weren\u2019t thrilled about the treatment and wait she told us \u201cwe should have played uno while we waited.\u201d It\u2019s really a shame because the food is good but it\u2019s not worth being treated this way.",
   "Food was great. Service is terrible all around, place is a lil run down, expensive for what they offer.\nMost of the fans or employees even of this place are also toxic to any bit of critique someone has to say just because they don't agree with the hype or experience they do. \n\nMusic is cool and the signs and other stuff around the place are unique.\nThis place could be a lot better then what it is by simple improvements."

I hope to see them some day. Seeing a train in old town has been a dream since I moved to Lansing 15 years ago. I plan to visit again to try out more of their menu.",
   "Food is good. Although  I eat better before in a different place. But this one is still one of the good Mexican restaurant. Like it",
   "I called to place an order, phone rang 20 times and I hung up. I drove there and walked in and the employee didn't care that no one picked up. I started to order food and the phone rang and she picked it up. That's annoying. Also was not allowed to use more than one $5 coupon from restaurant.com (supposed to be able to use $5 with each $10 spent) even though my bill was $43. Got home with the food and they had packed the soup sideways so a lot of it leaked. Food was fine, but the rest of this experience was poor",
   "We went to this area of Lansing to eat at another restaurant. The wait was to long for us at that place, so we walked around a bit. We're from out of town, and not familiar with the local places. Luckily we walked by this Pablo's, and decided to try it. We were not disappointed. The food was simple, but the flavors were amazing! Perfectly seasoned asada, and the best refried beans I've ever had! The prices were surprisingly cheap for the quality of the food, and we were served super fast. Top notch authentic Mexican food.",
   "Always really good! This place never disappoints!! One of the best places to eat in town!!!\n\nIn pic is beef caldo with the side of rice mixed in with it! My favorite to get with chips & salsa."

   "Amazing food.  Best steak ever!! Great table service !! . HOWEVER  ambiance could use some improvements! Edison bulbs mixed with blue light LEDs ,  Drop ceilings  bathrooms need details cleaned (edges and crevices ) the layout for bathrooms and traffic of people, waiter and waitress staff bringing food /walking flow is awfully cramped and awkward. Back steps are slippery.  Just some thoughts for a high end steakhouse."

I wasn't informed first couple times I'd went there, and expected fresh green beans with bacon.",

However, I do appreciate that they don't water down their dressings like a lot of restaurants. The mango margarita is soooo good, especially with the extra boost of either 1800 or Patron."

   "Our Waitress Sydney was awesome that is why I gave them a 3. If it wasn't for her it would be much lower score. We had a table of eight people. The food was ok. The reason I wont be back is one of the other servers. \n\nThe credit card machine wasn't working very fast so there was a line to check out. The hostess was doing a great job trying to move things along. Apparently we were in the way of one of the other waitresses. A tall older lady with her hair in a tight pony tail kept referring to us as,\n\nThose F@%king people!\n\nI think she realized she was not invisible when she saw me staring right at her. She only made the reference twice but she did it in front of friends 4 year old both times. Not cool",
   "After reading google reviews I decided to give this place a try, and was not disappointed at all!\nEven at 3pm they were still somewhat busy, usually a good sign. The entryway is crowded and basically nonexistent, walking in the door puts you basically at the counter where customers pay their bill and several were doing so at the time I arrived. Once seated our server, Ashley, was quick to greet us with a smile. I had the traditional gyro, made it a combo with fries and a soft drink. Asked to have my fries made with chili and cheese, was even given the option of shredded or cheese sauce. My company for lunch ordered a grilled chicken sandwich without mayo or a side. Total was a very moderate $16, outstanding value! Food came out in a timely manner and there is nothing I would change about it at all. They have a wide variety of menu items, breakfast all day and fair prices. The dining room was clean and well kept, I will most definitely return!",

While I love the food and support all staff, I would suggest you think before supporting the Food First corporation.",

Deep-fried ravioli is awesome but my favorite was the meatballs.",

The food prices were great, wait was extensive and was disappointed that my sandwich came out soggy on one side like it was waiting and fries were limp and not hot.  I don't mind the wait as long as the food is right.  Smoked brisket is not what I consider smoked, more like braised.  (Photo of fries and brisket) A little too much icing on cinnamon roll for my taste, ratio was off because they are quite thin.  The buttermilk biscuit looked great.  Would maybe go back to try.  Definitely not the worst but not the best place in Lansing for brunch. Games while you wait.  The service was great and owners appeared to be friendly and loved...had the food been great, it would have gotten 5 stars.",
   "Excellent restaurant!  The staff is friendly and the food was even better.  I had the Gorgonzola Burger and it was delicious! Everything was fresh, like you can tell they use homemade patties and not factory/frozen.  \n   The restaurant is small and doesn't appear to be much from the outside, but don't let that fool you!  It's well worth the visit.",
   "Visited my folks in Lansing over Father's Day & we had to go to this new breakfast place. Woke up at 8 a.m. to get there early and for good reason! Arrived to a jam packed parking lot and line starting to creep out the first door! \n\nThere's no sitting and trying to figure out what to eat. Hop in line, eye up the menu, order when it's your turn, grab you order number, your beverage *(Fresh Brewed Bigby Coffee)* and take your seat. \n\nFood followed shortly and was well worth the short wait! Reasonably priced and well portioned, we did the Santa Fe Breakfast Bowl w/chorizo, the American Breakfast Omelet (Mom loved the fried potatoes), and the Breakfast tacos (which is a breakfast first for me). Everything was well presented, super tasty, and filling. \n\nWe also ordered 4 cinnamon rolls to go. I'll let you about those later, but we heard they're a must! \n\nSupport local, support often. Enjoy!!!",
   "This place is a true hidden gem. Our food was ready on time, phenomenal service, and incredible food. The menu is eclectic but classic. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for a great, out of your ordinary, complete breakfast. I have not had the lunch items but I am extremely excited to try. 100% satisfied!!!!"

   "I've been to all the BBQ places in the Lansing area and Saddleback stands above them all. The service is impeccable, very friendly staff. The BBQ ribs and brisket are smoked just right along with the seasonings/rub. Took my daughter's there today and we had a fantastic time sitting outside in the sun. Also I should add, the bathroom is modern and super clean. Something I can be picky about when reviewing a restaurant. I recommend to all who are looking for good BBQ at a fair price.",
   "I had the brisket, greens, and beans. My sister had the chicken tacos, and Mac the and cheese. Nothing was 'good'. The greens had extremely fatty  chunks of 'meat', the beans tasted like chili beans in disguise as baked beans. We could not eat them. The sauce containers were small and half of them weren't even filled up half way. The brisket was the best part hands down. We ordered online obviously, considering.",
   "Love the bbq. Always fresh and quick service. Highly recommend the corn cake and pickles too! \nI like this place more than the other popular local place.",
   "Loving that Saddleback is still open for takeout during this quarantine. We have ordered a few times and have been extremely happy with every meal! Brisket tacos are fire!",
   "If I could offer 10 stars, I would.  This amazing place donated a mountain of amazing barbecue to frontline caregivers at sparrow hospital. \n Thank you so much, the food was incredible!!"

Reasonably priced considering the quality of food. Greeter and waiter were very cheerful and attentive. Dining area clean and warmly inviting.",
   "We had a mini reunion here with my high school friends. The staff is commendable, it was so nice of them to help me get the reservation despite some challenges. And their food was equally delicious of course. Their lettuce wraps is a must try! I will definitely keep coming back.",
   "Loved the sweet and sour chicken. A good balance of sweet and sour. Ginger was also a nice flavor in the dish. Our server was great. He made sure our drinks were kept filled and any thing we needed was taken care of.",
   "Party of five. Seated quickly. Very nice atmosphere. Great service. Food was good, but very expensive.",
   "I don\u2019t intend to speak in hyperbole here, but the food honestly tasted like a less flavorful Panda Express for 3x the cost. Panda Express is legitimately serving better food than this PF Chang\u2019s location. Also, even though we went on a really busy day, the service was surprisingly bad. Our server seemed like a nice kid but was way in over his head...and reeked of body odor. We were not happy, especially after coming to a PF Chang\u2019s for the first time in many years and having nothing but fond memories in the past. \n\nThe dessert with the coconut ice cream and fried wontons though, was divine. It is still one of my favorite desserts of all time. This is the only reason this review is getting 2 stars. That and the undeniably beautiful interior and lively ambiance. However, when the food sucks, nothing else really matters."

   "My date and I experienced the State Rooms sunday brunch buffet this weekend, it was fantastic, the salmon with chardonnay sauce was my favourite. Our waiter was excellent along with our host. I would recommend making a reservation and to note that one can reserve a more private dinning room similar to a conference room. They served Paramount brand coffee, we purchased a pound of from the restaurant before we left. I recommend the State room for a more upscale brunch option.",
   "First time going, it's difficult to find the restaurant from the parking garage. Have to actively look around to find your way there. \n\nIt was a pleasant experience being served by students learning. You could tell they were still learning, but they cared about their work. It seemed a bit empty for a weekend night in there, but still comfortable. \n\n I wouldn't recommend ordering the hen though, there no thrills to it and chicken is better. But I would prefer juicy Quail on the menu instead. The desert menu is a step up from most restaurants and the sorbet is chilled and served perfectly. Very impressed with the sorbet. Would go back again!",
   "My wife and I's first time coming here was after we had gotten married. We usually come here on special occasions and are never not satisfied with our food and customer service.  \n\nTruly a great place to come. The atmosphere is soft, mellow, quiet, relaxed and all other synonyms of those words. I highly suggest The State Room Restaurant.",
   "Prefer the small menu, fresh, simple, Michigan creative. Locals enjoy, summer offers outside jazz nite dining. Don't miss it. Teaching undergrads how to be successful in Hospitality Business. They learn first hand from professional chefs. Menu is locally grown food and produce.  Brunch is good if you haven't experienced it."

The real deal Mediterranean coffee is one of my personal favorites in the Lansing area. I appreciate the refills are free. Staff is friendly along with good service. I'm leaving 4 stars as opposed to 5 due to the uncomfortable both seats and the place has deferred maintenance/updates on the decor.",
   "For $16+, you can get this lamb+chicken kabob w rice. To be honest, the price is a bit high for this portion. And the kabobs are a bit burnt. \n\nI am giving 4 stars to give them a chance to improve. I think they give a lot of condiments (bread, etc) but small meat and rice portions for the money. \n\nIf you come here, i suggest the sandwiches as those are much more worth it.",

The noodles were good. My wife loved her dish. The bread that came out to start was great. Bathrooms could use some updating, overall atmosphere was very nice. To end I had the bourbon ice cream, heavy bourbon flavor but still good. I would recommend trying it out of you've been curious and I wouldn't mind coming back.",
   "Absolutely love this place. Service and food are both always great! \nReservations are a good idea on busier nights as they may not even have room at the bar without a reservation.\nAt dinner be sure to get the bread with salted butter, it's amazing!\nPortions are pretty large, but they offer a half for most of their entrees. Unless you are incredibly hungry, or want leftovers, the half portion is usually plenty if you have bread and an appetizer.",
   "Oh man. What an experience. Cracked it off with the calamari ~ amazing. The attention to flavor and bringing together senses that BELONG, the sour of the pepper pickles balancing the weight of the fried calamari, dressed in lovely herbs. Divine. The goat cheese ravioli was a whole different beast. I can't describe that sauce but it complements the cheese in... The most perfect way. To top it off, a lovely garnish of basil sprouts, too cute. Absolutely an experience, and at a reasonable price! Make the trip",
   "The food selections seem to have something for everyone's palette. The prices are fair and the food is excellent along with pleasing to the eyes presentation. We really liked how the entrees give you the option of a small or larger portion and priced according. My wife and I like to order different entrees and appetizers and share our food. We had Kyle as our server and he was spot on! A refreshing change from our last couple restaurant experiences where the food was good, however, the service was poor which is a real drag when you're spending decent money for the dinning experience.. The decor is just so so.. The building is the old Kentucky Fried Chicken that closed after an employee was murdered during an armed robbery in 2011. I felt there was a bit too many tables so when busy during Friday and Saturday night you're kinda shoehorned in there. The legs of the small tables near the bar are not level prompting our server having to place folded up napkins under one of the legs to prevent the table from rocking side to side. I would think a restaurant would have that figured out before opening up for business. A bit too much lighting in the restaurant I thought as well. All in all we did enjoy our experience and will return. When we do we'll request Kyle to be our server he was fantastic!",

   "I like this place a lot and went there twice while visiting my dad over the holidays. I think he eats here at least once a week! If you come for lunch, the meal includes a tofu soup, salad, and spring roll. The entree portions whether for lunch or dinner are huge! The first time we came, we ordered lettuce wraps, papaya salad, and fresh rolls to share. I got a small cup of tofu soup and my dad had either tom kha or tom yum (don't remember). The next we came for lunch and I had the red curry noodle and my dad ordered the green curry. Everything was so delicious and the ingredients tasted very fresh. The service left a little to be desired but that's often the case in a college town. Overall, they have excellent food especially for having such a large menu. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town!",
   "Went with some co-workers for lunch.  I ate the chicken pad Thai, which was tasty.

   "This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Lansing/East-Lansing area. The food is great. The ambience of the resultant is not second to the taste of the food, either. If you go for the Lunch time you get a complimentary appetizer dish with your main meal. I recommend the Prik Pao fried rice and Pad See Ew (noodles)."

I have always denied her and we would go someplace else. Anyway, I finally caved in yesterday (because no one else was open) and we stopped here and ordered the lentil sandwich! WOW! That was by far the most amazing thing I have ever eaten! It tasted just like a hamburger, with the texture and meaty taste. I am actually really excited to go back again this week! They have lots to choose from and from the brief interaction I had with employees, they seemed very nice! I am so sorry I denied my wife in coming here, we will be back a lot more now! I wonder if they sell growlers or where I can get one? I really want to try there beers! Anyway, if your looking for great food, I highly recommend this place! Also, Thank you for being open during COV19!",

The food is flavorful. And I really appreciate the presentation they provide. It's a nice environment inside and the wait staff are always very polite. I ALWAYS get the spicy chicken breast stew, but this time I also got a half order of the spicy lentils, and they were great. I loved my whole meal!",

The restaurant has a unique and casual feel and smells heavenly.  If you don't want to eat traditionally with your hands, utensils can be requested easily and the staff is very accommodating.   I will definitely be returning to try some more of the menu!",

I always love a restaurant with a bigger vegetarian menu than not, and this place didn't disappoint. I highly recommend doing half rice and half bread, because the rice is delicious and gives you a bit more variety. We will be back!",

Their food is really delicious. I've tried almost all of their dishes and each one is full of flavours. One suggestion though : it'd be nice to have some kind of sauce/dressing with the sambusa.."

   "I have been a customer of Charlie Kang\u2019s for over 12 years now and have always been a fan of their delicious food and great prices.\n\nA few days ago, I placed an order for pickup. I have been trying to support local businesses as much as I can during this difficult time. Earlier in the day I saw an article posted online featuring Charlie Kang\u2019s and it inspired me to place an order there. I was incredibly excited to eat some delicious Chinese and Korean food.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel as though I set my hopes too high because I was really let down. I was very disappointed in the food :( (which was approximately $42 worth). The food quality was not at all what I remember it being; the chicken tasted like it was reheated/old and the chow mei fun did not taste fresh. I actually ended up throwing it away because it was that underwhelming.\n\nI hate writing this because I have always loved Charlie Kang\u2019s; I also hate saying anything negative because I know restaurants are struggling at this time. But, this is just my honest review.\n\nI\u2019m weary on trying them again because of this experience, but as I said, I\u2019m a long-standing customer, so maybe it was just an off day for them.",

The best Mongolian chicken. The fresh spring rolls was something I've never had in my life. After eating those, I don't think I am going back to the fried spring rolls. Amazing dish.",

   "Best kept secret! I had given up hope on finding good Chinese fare in the Lansing area, and was very impressed with Huapei. The service and food are just wonderful! We got our tea and rangoons pretty quickly, and the total wait for dinner was about 20-30 minutes. Not too long, and it's obvious that everything was freshly prepared. The sauces appear to be from scratch, and the chicken and shrimp had a light, crispy battered coating. The rice was perfect. The freshly sliced green onions on top of the dish were a nice touch. The portions are generous and prices pretty low, with most dinners at about $9 (and I took home left overs!). Our server was so sweet and attentive, and was able to recommend a dish to me when I asked questions. We can't wait to go back!!",

   "My son and I really enjoyed this restaurant. The pho was superb and my son's Cuban sandwich was yummy. The French fries were off the charts, fresh cut, and the array of various BBQ sauce made ketchup step aside. I can't wait to try the BBQ too. The service was perfect and the owner was there and delightful.",
   "Great food for a great price! We loved the Brisket Banh Mi and it was amazing! That was by far our favorite items we ordered. We ordered take out and it was ready quickly! We got some much food for a reasonable price  and it fed three people easily! We look forward to going back!",
   "Of the BBQ spots I've been in Lansing, Capital City BBQ has the best southern style sauce (The Dirty South).  I'll have to go again to get a good feel for this place.  My first try was decent.  The potato salad way too soupy though.",
   "This is a great combination of foods-BBQ and Vietnamese.  I had a rice bowl with brisket, fantastic.  I checked out the bathroom.  Very very clean.  I think that is a testimony of a clean kitchen and backroom.  We will come again.",
   "Incredible BBQ! Definitely one of my new favorite spots in the lansing area. Surprising variety in menu, with all the classic BBQ dishes plus specialty items like rib tips, smoked wings, even smoked salmon, plus an entire Vietnamese menu as well! And their Vietnamese stuff is no joke, it's delicious and made with obvious care. Egg and spring rolls in particular were delicious.\n\nHighly recommend any sandwich, highly recommend the baked beans, highly recommend the sauces, highly recommend the fries. You're going to want to come back to try other menu items\n\nIt's definitely not a looker from the outside, and parking isn't super easy, but don't let that stop you!"

   "Very good Mexican food. Dinner took a bit long considering the restaurant wasn't packed. Overall a good experience & we'll be back. Returned with my daughter a couple months later and the service was painfully slow.. Again it wasn't that busy. I revised my review to 3 stars."

The chicken tenders are also great and uniquely breaded or battered. I've never had tenders like theirs anywhere else.",
   "The best \"fast food\", if you can call it that, in town. Food is always delicious. Everything is made fresh when you order it and you can taste it. Their chicken strips are the best in town with no competition. You can sit inside or sit outside with a nice view of the river. I've even sat down and hung out with some ducks while eating my lunch. It's cool, I'm happy to share with them. I'll never stop coming here. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.",

   "I eat here all the time and it\u2019s great! Love all the plant based options because they really compete with the meat/dairy dishes on their own. The lemon pancakes for breakfast/brunch are to die for but the grits, and vegan chicken and waffles are also amazing. Dinner is great too though there are only a few options. Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re all great, and there serve lots of small plates too. Really love this place! Also there\u2019s generally a baked good in the morning and those are always good too.",
   "Very cool vibe, love the decorations. Drinks were great... Don't want to undervalue a good drink. Bloody Mary & mimosa were definitely quality. Even with that being said the food was  for sure the star of the show! Brunch people get in here if you haven't. Grilled cheese & tomato Bennie was amazing, so we're pancakes. No doubt this is a repeat, regularly!",
   "This place is a great find! I went here the other day with some family and was very impressed. I ordered the vegan chicken and waffles served with a  rhubarb compound butter and a slice of watermelon. \nThe waffle had a nice caramel flavor to it and was very light. And the vegan chicken kind of had a  falafel flavor to it, is the best way I can explain it.\nAnyways I haven\u2019t really had much vegan food before and never at a restaurant and now I\u2019ve become intrigued to try more things like this in the future. The only thing that would have made the dish more complete I think would for it to have some sort of a small apple slaw or salad on the side. That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m not giving this place a 5 star review.\nI also had a bite of a beet sandwich and that was perfect. The vinaigrette that is used with it and how everything meshes with it was like a dance of love. Honestly the sandwich I would rate 5 stars but anyhow nevertheless this place is a must try.",
   "Hands down the food of The People's Kitchen is delicious. Everything that we ordered was super tasty and exceeded expectations. The pancakes were buttery soft and melted in every bite. The streak was freaking amazing and so was rest of the food. But you should note that the service is quite slow, but is friendly. We visited at noon on a hot day so even the space wasn't too comfortable for waiting for the food.",
   "INCREDIBLE brunch menu. Ordered four dishes and every single one blew us away. The restaurant was born from a food truck operation, and it shows because all the seasonal dishes have a satisfying and fresh spin on them, like the pork belly cheddar grits, or the to-die-for crunchy waffle. Service was phenomenal and the space is colorful with plenty of parking. As of time of writing, the place is pretty new, so check it out before it catches on and gets busy!"

   "I order no cheese on my burritos. They always put cheese on it. I\u2019m lactose so I puke every time.  It\u2019s like they don\u2019t know how to fold a burrito without loading it up with cheese to make it sticky. They\u2019re disorganized and the toppings are flung everywhere and cross contamination.  I can\u2019t tell you how many times I ask for something not to be added and turns out it\u2019s in my food.  I find floaties in my fountains. I\u2019m pretty tired of this place. They need to be more organized, clean, and on top of things. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place if you want food made the way you ask for it and not to have cross contamination from other products they serve with their food.",
   "Nice and clean restaurant fast and friendly service, had the breakfast burrito , they are so good ! Parking downtown to the restaurant can be a hassle, so carry a couple of dollars in quarters to feed the parking meter, which is strictly enforced,  the  breakfast burrito are only available from 8-10:30 a.m. I certainly enjoy my eating experience at Jalapenos. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf7dJust wish  the restaurant was not located downtown, because of the difficulty in navigating to it, as well as high parking rates and limited parking spaces.",
   "Best restaurant in downtown Lansing. The best deals/specials ever (Monday and Friday get 2 tacos, rice, beans and chips for $7). Delicious, great service, they even have ice cream in the summer!",

   "Great evening at a local farm to table restaurant.  We ordered several dishes and shared. All very good. We ended the night with an adult Chocolate Milk.  Great finish.  I hope my son decides to go to Michigan State so we can go back!\n\nThe menu was easy to understand with several amazing choices.  \n\nI like the farm to table concept.  Each dish was original and fresh.  \n\nI though my ginger soup was the best I have ever had.  I got a bowl because I thought it would be good but they offer small shooter versions of you just want to try.",
   "This place's atmosphere was very airy and relaxing. The food was great, although the grind was too salty for my taste. The bisque was amazing. The shrimps (saute) were exceptional, and I'm picky with my seafood. We had an apple up-side-down cake for dessert and it was delicious, especially the icecream! The highlight, though, has got to be the homemade sugar that came with my coffee. \nI could feel the care and the hospitality from the chefs and servers, and that showed through the ingredients, the food, and the service. My husband and I definitely come back to support this business and try other dishes.",
   "I have eaten here for lunch, happy hour, and tasting dinners for special occasions. The rotating menu is seasonal and uses available produce from Michigan, and the dishes are well thought out. Lunch and happy hour are great for the price if you are concerned that Red Haven is not affordable. The dinner plates are surprisingly filling, so you definitely get your money's worth there too. Desserts are hit and miss, sometimes overly sweet and not complementary to the rest of the meal (but I recommend the pavlova when available). Cocktails have been hit and miss too; I wish they were on par with places like American Fifth. It can be loud and busy, so make a reservation and ask for the best times to be seated. Service is friendly and fast. One of the nicest restaurants in the East Lansing/Lansing/Okemos area, and absolutely worth a visit.",
   "Very interesting food combinations.  I recommend highly food was delicious and highly seasoned.   This is a dining experience not a quick serve restaurant.  Half off bottles of wine on Tuesday so make a reservation.",
   "We went to the New Year's Eve celebration at Red Haven and it was wonderful! The staff dressed up in 20s costume and did an excellent job. \n\nThe prix fixe menu was wonderful and having 6 plates of food inspired by the 20s, was a wonderful portrait of food flavors by a creative ched. It's always special, unusual and delicious, the pallette they use is completely unexpected -- flavor combinations you wouldn't typically expect. And the wine pairings also were perfect.\n\nSome people may think they won't be \"full,\" but I've never left hungry -- so don't let that stop you from visiting Red Haven. Their normal menu, you can pick as many small plates as you want to share with your table. Enjoy them and enjoy the company and have a good time."

Great customer service, the hostess greets you with a smile and a upbeat \"hello\". The staff is very friendly and courteous. Food prices are reasonable and a whole lot of televisions. Try the pizza and the pull pork sandwiches, you'll love it. Take the family, go on a date; just an overall great place.",
   "A place that looked like it might have something decent to eat, but the host's station was a ghost town. I waited for over 3 minutes for someone to acknowledge me and at least say they'd be with me in just a moment alas no?

   "Upon entering the restaurant was warmly greeted by two beautiful waitresses named Debbie and Ruby , they were so friendly , I felt welcome, I ordered the #2 marinated pork rice plate, it was very delicious, along with two shrimp spring rolls,  I left very satisfied, the restaurant was very clean,  definitely will be returning soon , hopefully to try the pho soups and the crepes. I highly recommend you to come try it. Definitely enjoyed my eating experience at NOLA Bistro.",
   "Worst first experience ever. There were bones in my chicken tacos, and 2 out of 3 had long black hair in them. I ended up going to McDonald's.",
   "Ordered Pho for take out during the \"Stay home, stay safe\". I was skeptical of buying pho from somewhere other than a Vietnamese restaurant. However, it was very delicious!! Five stars.",
   "Wow - really authentic Vietnamese food. The pho is to die for!!! Sorry, food so good... it's gone before I remember to take a pic.",
   "We went there because we know how.good their Pho and spring rolls are, and they exceeded our expectations.  Service was great and all around us was a very diverse clientele. All ages too."

   "Cute and delicious place for lunch. We've tried a variety of things but the best is the chicken satay appetizer. Brown it to your liking on your own mini grill with a peanut butter dip and cucumber sauce. Service and food is great. Would recommend.",
   "I give them a 5/5 for the quality and value of the food.  We've been to several Asian and Thai restaurants around and it's hard to find food that's actually spicy, Bankok house has been my favorite place for over 7 years! I usually get 2-3 meals from my entree, so it's a great value for me. The woman who answers the phone is awesome, she's just fast because they are so busy. If you want awesome Thai food, give them a try.",
   "I enjoy my eating experience,  the Pad Thai with shrimp combined with extra shrimp and vegetables,  was delicious and  more than enough to satisfy my hungry appetite. I also  had chicken fried rice , which I took home, couldn't finish eating it. The service was great along with a friendly and courteous staff. Looking forward to coming back soon. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
   "This restaurant will surprise you. I tried it first in 2018 because I knew I liked Thai food and it is one of my favorites in Lansing. I haven't had a dish I didn't like. Also, the spice scale is normal, if you want medium, it's medium. If you want hot, it's hot. A must try if you like Thai food.",
   "Great food in the smells are wonderful. I really like their pad Thai. The service is very fast and sometimes you feel like you are in their way. Worth a try... And very authentic."

The food around me looked so tempting that I tried to convince him to eat, but he already had breakfast. Once we're allowed to socialize and go out again, I'm immediately returning to this place. The staff was friendly and kept our coffee topped off. The hippie hash also looked delicious. The fact that it was steadily busy and was filled with all types of people is encouraging and speaks volumes about its food and value.",
   "Great feel... Felt like I was on a movie set. The classic look and atmosphere of the old classic diner was great. Our service was awesome. The food was amazing and price wasn't too bad. Only rating it a 3 because it's still a old diner but was a GREAT old diner. Definitely coming back.",
   "Service was quick. Food portions are huge. My eggs for Benedict were right on. Hollandaise was mildly creamy with bright citrus flavor. Multiple styles of hash available. My man was not impressed but he ate most of his meal. Tables are small, dinner style so don't let plates pile up. Things come on plates to be served but consolidate where you can. Hot Tea came with lemon and real honey with tea bag on the side. They way it should be.",
   "I've only ordered via Doordash. Really good food. Portions are amazing v cost. I've only tried their breakfast items and have never been disappointed. Food comes hot and fresh. Love their oatmeal. \nAll of my orders have been correct with condiments and eating utensils provided.\nLove this restaurant.",

When I went up the counter, the guy started to put it together in front of me. He had to ask me again what I wanted and kept getting it wrong, like it wasn\u2019t written down anywhere the first time. A quick In and out ended up taking longer than I thought.",

We were sat down by our host who was very polite, our server took a while getting things like a menu, coffee and creamer, and then none of the food came out at the same time and the restaurant was not even that busy. Although I didnt let this bother me, it did upset my family. Would try again, but maybe find a better server next time.",

   "Went for lunch because I was hard craving a burger and the pics online looked good. Should have taken the time to read reviews. For downtown Lansing at noon-thirty it should have been busy. Half full. Well. Cool, I don't gotta wait. Seat myself and had a very nice server. Get the burger (well done cuz, duh, burger) and tots. Not a bad wait. Good looking burger. Nice presentation. Tots were yummy. Fresh, appropriately seasoned. Okay. I bite the burger. Eh. Just, eh. It's a thick little hunk of dry, unseasoned beef. Not bad. Not great. And dry because thoroughly cooking a thick patty dries it out. That's kind of burger 101. The bun was just barely toasted and an icky, plain one but needed more to handle the insides. The place also had a grungy feel, and not in a cool way. So, they need to get some meatier buns, toast them, discover seasonings and flatten that patty out a smidge more. Then clean that place senseless and I'd consider a re-visit. Until then, I'll walk the extra quarter mile to Wendy's.",
   "An amazing place to have burgers and beers. Their beer list is amazing. Their burgers are amazing. Perfectly cooled and juicy. I had their olive burger. I was skeptical at first as I do not like olives, but just after my first bite, i fell in love with that burger. Their club fries is definitely something to have. I had heard that you can't stop eating those fries, and now I can second that statement.",
   "Found this place when looking for somewhere to eat downtown. Casual and cozy. Waitstaff very friendly. Great selection of craft beers, including their own brews. Appetizers and entrees were really good. Falafel bites with dip and southwest burger were exceptional. We lucked out and got to catch stand-up comedy as well.",
   "Went for lunch and then back the next day for brunch.  Food both times was great!  We had the burger a(perfectly cooked medium), Philly dip and for brunch we tried the breakfast tacos and the Fat Elvis French toast. Everything was delicious. Notably, sweet potato fries were the best I've had. Really enjoyed the breakfast tacos. These people know how to treat potatoes. The flavors were right on. We also had the Concord cider and a couple of the beers. Really good! Tried the Mimosa and bloody Mary. Would've liked the Mimosa grapefruit to be made with fresh squeezed.

We waited for several minutes for our food to arrive.  We the. Placed our dinner orders which also took several minutes.  By then, we ordered another round of drinks.

About 10 minutes later she told us not to worry they found another table.  About 10 minutes later the manager arrives at our table and asked us how the food was, we said it was great.  Then he folded his hands and my husband asked him: You want us to leave?  He said yes not to be mean but yes we need the table.  Seriously?  We just spent a lot of money on drinks, appetizers, and dinners for 4 and we were never asked if we wanted dessert, coffee or more drinks.  Just we need the table.  I\u2019m insulted, as were our friends.  We eat out a lot and I\u2019ve never been asked to leave a restaurant.  We recently returned from a trip to Ireland where some of the friendliest people I\u2019ve ever met welcomed us as strangers to their country.  They never asked us to leave and instead encouraged us to stay longer.  Very disappointed with your hospitality!   Our total time there was 1.5 hours.  Not excessive by any means.",
   "Fantastic food at a great price. Had the fish and chips and a Guinness for dinner. Excellent meal in a cool Irish pub environment.",
   "Fast and friendly staff. I tried the Ginger Bush cocktail, if you like whiskey and Moscow mules then this is a fun twist on that. Super refreshing. I also had the pan seared trout, very good! Would definitely have it again \ud83d\udc4d",
   "Claddagh has a great combination of Irish fare and typical pub food. Their staff are always friendly and the food is always good. You'll see a great mix between young and old there on any given night, so it's a great place for everyone.",
   "We just got done eating here for the first time and it was for our 2 year anniversary. We wanted to try some place we both haven\u2019t been. We were both disappointed and won\u2019t be coming back. \nThe bartender was our waitress and didn\u2019t write down our build your own burger order. Both of our burgers came to us wrong. My boyfriend was ok with his but he sent my burger back for me since it was missing the fried egg and onion straws. When my new burger was delivered, it had the correct toppings however it was under cooked. I always order my burgers well done. Obviously the bartender needs to write down orders so she can put them in to the computer correctly. What a waste of money..."

   "It's the McDonald's of Italian food. I tried the ultimate sampler. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great. The price however was really good. I'd probably go back there for lunch, and maybe occasionally dinner if I just want something quick and cheap. It's a really good value for the price, but if you want really good Italian food, I'd look elsewhere.",
   "I gave them only 3 stars because I was not greeted, even though there were 3 workers in my vicinity. The food was delicious. I had a very customized order and the got it right! Kudos to them for that. When it was time to take care of my dishes, the waste hole was blocked by cleaning buckets and supplies, so I had to just leave them above the dish bin (which was full). \nThe restaurant was clean and my dinner was delicious!!",
   "Fazoli's is one of my favorite fast food restaurants.  It is great to get a delicious Italian meal so quickly.  The first Fazoli's that  I went to was in Appleton, WI many years ago.  Then after that I was mainly going to the one in Lansing,  MI as we don't have one near where I live.  Now, as I travel I have been seeking them out.  The spaghetti and sauce are my favorite, and the bread sticks are unlimited and they are also delicious.  I recently tried the pizza and that was very good also.",
   "Eating allergy free and VEGAN at this Fazolis was made simple and easy! Thank you for being so accommodating! We ordered this spicy penne pasta dish adjusted to meet our dietary requirements.\n\"Staff were very helpful and focused on getting it right the first time.\ud83d\udc4d\"",
   "If you're looking for a cheap, quick option for a great pasta night, Fazoli's is the place. They have spaghetti to bacon Mac and cheese. Don't forget the breadsticks, those are to die for. Most items on the menu, are unlimited. 10/10!"

   "Anyone that has ever come here knows that their menu is awesome with lots of choices but their tortilla chips, salsa and cheese dip is incredible and a must have!  A great place to enjoy with family and friends!!",
   "Delicious traditional Mexican food at great prices with friendly service. Chips and salsa are both homemade and excellent. I\u2019ve been visiting El Az since the late 1980s and choose this location over the EL location any day. Awesome new patio addition!",
   "Amazing food . Generous portions . Great service. Salsa was the bomb. El Porto in owosso ahould take cooking leason from them. Real mexican food",
   "It was crazy busy when we went due to Christmas rush and being down a server. Even so, our food came quickly after being ordered.  It was hot and delicious as always.   I was pleasantly surprised to find that on Monday kids 12 and under eat free.  We had to ask for chips to go with our cheese dip and hunt down someone to get our check but everyone was helpful and very apologetic.  They work very well as a team and made a genuine effort to make it work.",
   "I have been going there since I can remember as a kid. LOVE their burrito plates, my favorite platter! The spicy burrito needs to be spicier though. Went there right after I graduated from Michigan State and it was awesome!"

   "Enjoyed the Shrimp Tempura Appetizer was Amazing & such a Beautiful Presentation as well! We enjoyed our Uni Soups - Shrimp Tempura & the Chicken one & the were {{{Scrumptious}}}",
   "The location is a bit hidden, you\u2019ll have to drive into the back of the parking lot to get to it. The service was good, he waiters are nice. My only complaint is the quality of the sashimi. It\u2019s not the best, I believe it is frozen which is fine but the price doesn\u2019t reflect that. The soft shell crab was very good though. I would order that again.",
   "What a great experience. We felt the staff really took care in how to ensure the safety of staff and customers during this time. We have always enjoyed Ai\u2019s sushi, but their commitment to sanitization and cleanliness was truly impressive and the sushi was delicious. I would definitely recommend ordering from Ai Fusion any time, but especially if you are looking for a place to support during these hard times.",
   "This place is a little hidden to get to. Amazing service and ambience. Their sushi is really good and I'd come back again for their sushi. I had their fusion roll and the AI roll and both of them were really good. For the appetizer i tried their gyoza which was okay. It didn't really taste like a gyoza.",
   "Excellent sushi, really good service! All around great place to dine at a really good price. You'll never go away hungry & usually have take home. A must try"

   "Nice little cozy eating spot in downtown Lansing. The food is flavorful and delicious. Portions are nice size. Fast friendly service. Busy during our lunch visit but everything was handled well. We will come back again.",
   "We were very pleased with our meal + are eager to try more dishes.\n\nTraditional Cuban Sandwich was very good, especially paired with a side of Fried Yuca + garlicky Ketchup Mayo dipping sauce, which were my favorites! \n\nChurrasco de Pollo, Rice + Beans + Maduros (instead of Tostones that come with the platter). The chicken was tender + flavorful! The maduros were riper + softer than I prefer, but I do love the pairing of sweet plantanos with savory chicken, rice + beans. \n\n(FYI: As a foodie of Caribbean descent, I cheered when I plucked a piece of bay leaf from my rice \u2014 it's like finding a prize in a cereal box + further proof that this is made-from-scratch the way I cook mine at home!)\n\nThe fresh Pineapple Juice was delicious + not too sweet. \n\nCafe Con Leche was tasty, but I do like my espresso to be a bit stronger.",
   "Muy rico! My mother-in-law is Cuban and La Cocina Cubana is the closest thing I can get to her authentic Cuban cooking. The dishes here are truly Cuban and food is extremely delicious. Try the ropa vieja or the vaca frita, two is my favorite Cuban dishes and La Cocina Cubana makes them perfectly!",
   "Server was very nice,  friendly and food was delicious.",
   "Delicious coffee! My boyfriend and I stopped in here after a tour of the Capitol because all the Biggbys and other coffee places around were closed. It was so good! Went down extremely smoothly with a nice crema and it was very strong, just the way I like it. A perfect pick-me-up! Definitely will be back next time we're in Lansing."

   "I have been all over the country for more years than I will express now. However... I will say I have been to over 10,000 restaurants. Some were great, some not so much. But. This resurrection of an amazing experience at a restaurant deserves nothing short of 5 stars. Wait staff was incredible. The ingredients of the food.... Out of this world. It was a family friendly environment. I am so happy to say that me and my family will always return. Thank You! Great Work!",
   "Overall great experience. Interesting menu but they make it work to be honest. Want pho they have it, want sushi they have it, want mac and cheese they have it, want burger or wings they have it. The crab rangoon was good - light and fluffy. My wife had their classic burger and it was on point. I had the high end mac and cheese and it was good but I think for $17 it wasn't great. It would be nice to have a $12-13 option without the brisket (but the brisket was good). The chocolate cake was a little underwhelming, which was surprising because they mentioned they get it from Cheesecake Factory. Great beer and wine selection well done. The atmosphere was good, but it felt awkward to have so many TVs on the walls, it's upscale dinning with buffalo wild wings TVs on the walls? It's even more perplexing because there is a bar right next door which I believe are owned by the same people. But that's a nitpick I suppose. I would recommend and will definitely be back.",
   "Lunch buffet is great. The place is clean and stylish. Wait staff is friendly and prompt. I went here once and loved it so much that I went back 2 more times. The sriracha chicken is to die for. The selection is smaller than other buffets, but the quality is pretty high. There are 6-7 dishes plus various sushi rolls and things. Will be a regular, and I don't even like to eat lunch!",
   "Went for Valentine's day and was pleasantly  surprised. The food was great.We ordered the special Bree cheese appetizer which was amazing. We also ordered the maukau sushi roll which had a bit of spicy to it but lots of good flavors. The prices where a bit high but not outrageous. They had a large selection of drinks to choose from. The service was great. I definitely will go back to  try out more of the menu.",
   "We went for Valentine's dinner and I am very happy with the experience.  The food was 10/10. It has a great ambiance, the server was very pleasant.  I would be excited to go again"
