   "A moving and relevant museum showing, sometimes in graphic detail, the horrors of slavery and it's continued impacts on people today. Definitely worth a visit no matter your skin color. Children are welcome and this museum can be a great teaching opportunity, but kids will probably understand it better after 10-11ish. Younger than that will still get the basic concepts.",
   "I encourage everyone to go visit this Museum! It is very informative! Parents please be warned that some images and stories are graphic. Please use caution when bringing small children. It\u2019s is a great place for a date night for couples as well. I plan to visit again soon!",
   "The Legacy Museum was a wonderful last stop on our day-long trip to Montgomery. After visiting the memorial, we visited the museum, located in a warehouse used in the past for holding slaves. Upon entry, we were immediately struck by the informational and expressive exhibits inside. Completely self-paced, you could easily spend hours inside. Highly recommend.",
   "A place that after visiting you probably think it is unforgettable. It is like walking through part of history, so live, sad and true! \nThey utilize excellent design and new technology to effectively connect with audience and tell the story of real people. It's well worth the time.",
   "While a somber experience, the museum is DC-quality.  Very well done. The holograms immediately upon entry are unforgettable as is most of the museum.   I went to the National Memorial for Peace and Justice as well and was equally moved."

   "Easy to get to. Not very crowded on days there are no field trips. Great place for all ages. The walkways could use fixing up. A few areas have broken concrete and are uneven. Definitely check out the Mann wildlife center. There are awesome displays of stuffed animals in there.",
   "Great zoo! Good size for small children,a preschooler can see the whole thing without getting too tired. Zoo admission also includes the Mann Wildlife museum and the stingray petting, both which are worth doing. When entering the zoo, I recommend going to the right first since the playground is to the left. If you go right first you can do the whole zoo and end at the playground. There is also a train and skylift which are both enjoyable. They also have pygmy hippos which are adorable. At Christmas they have a lights display as well, so worth the visit during the holidays.",
   "This was a really nice zoo. We have been to several national zoos, and have yet to see the animal availability that is here. Every animal was it and visible from several viewing angles. All animals seemed healthy and happy. All in all, it's a really nice, local zoo. Definitely recommend.",
   "My son just loves going to the zoo. Even though the animals were lazing around out of sight it was still a good visit.  The Ray's were extra playful some really liked to be touched.",
   "Had a nice visit back again in Montgomery! I have not been to the zoo since it opened. Wow what a change! The zoo looks like they are trying so hard but funding is desperately needed for not only the animals but some paint to freshen up the buildings. It would be nice for a club to donate their time to repair and paint the structures. That said.we had a very nice time 5 adults and one 7 year old child. They were setting up lights for the annual Christmas display. I would say go. It is not expensive..but entertaining in a calm manner. BTW we did not visit the Mann museum but if you are into taxidermy I am sure you will  like it."

She was closely connected to Dr. King and other great leaders from this community, and she channeled their love and open heartedness in a beautiful way.  I have a deep connection to Dr. King, so for me, being there was a kind of holy pilgrimage. I feel uplifted and inspired to do more to make the world a kinder place.",

   "An uplifting experience.  The church looks much like it did when Martin Luther King Jr was pastor.  The tour by Wanda was moving and it\u2019s great to see the preserving and continuing of such an important mission \ud83d\ude0a",

   "Today was our very first time going to this museum and we aren't sure if we're returning. There was a female security guard who followed us around the entire time and made us feel uncomfortable. She harassed us about our diaper bag and told us we couldn't have it with us. The guard in the front never mentioned we couldn't bring our diaper bag,only that we couldn't bring our stroller wagon. She was talking loudly on her phone and left her post plenty of times. Overall she was unprofessional and made us feel extremely uncomfortable. She didn't follow anyone else in the museum that was there with toddlers so, why were we followed? My wife and I weren't touching anything or acting out of place. She was literally behind us at every turn we made. The male guards were nice and spoke to us. It got to the point we abruptly stopped browsing the art  and just left. She needs to work on her people skills.",

   "Amazing historical tour of Martin Luther King Jr's home. \n\nThere is free parking behind the home and the staff are so friendly. The tour begins with a short video followed by a tour of the parsonage. Our guide was really informative and took time to point out the smallest details and knowledge about the King family. Following the tour, there is an opportunity to visit the King Johns Garden for Reflection which was a fitting end.\n\nThe tour lasts about an hour. We were travelling from the UK so it was difficult to book a time before we arrived but by just turning up we were the only couple there so it was like a private tour.\n\nWould recommend this to anyone in the area and really glad we chose to go go hear whilst visiting Montgomery.",
   "Great hour tour. It was just what we were looking for on MLK day. \n\nThe tour might not start off great. They have you watch a 10-15 min poorly produced video of the home\u2019s history before going over. In my opinion they could completely cut that out. The talking and in-person storytelling was much better. \n\nThe tour guide did an awesome job telling the story of 54-60 as though we were there. He had lots of anecdotal evidence and retrospection, meeting history. I don\u2019t think he could have done a better job delivering historic wonderment to the kids in the group. He tailored the tour to the audience well. \n\nThere may be some points that are more round about, but the tour is a well spent hour of your time while in Montgomery. \n\nMake sure to follow the Dexter Parsonage up with going to the MLK\u2019s Church on 454 Dexter Ave!"

It\u2019s donation-based, so nothing lost, in any case.",

Some of the original wallpaper is still visible. Parking is available on site.\n\nIf you get the chance spend the night in the Airbnb! It's located above the museum. After the Fitzgerald's moved the house was divided into 4 apartments. The two upstairs apartments can be rented on Airbnb! It's called the Fitz. We loved our stay in the Scott Suite. It was so well decorated and atmospheric. Unfortunately as far as I could see the apartments are not wheelchair accessible.",

The house is of course very old and as such didn't have the most modern furnishings.  But that's what made the stay very unique for us. Much more memorable than a stay at a local Marriott would have been!",

   "My family stopped by here on our way back to Louisiana after a trip to Savannah. I wish we had had more time to really explore this house. They have so much to see and read an explore. It's a very complete an expansive collection of both of their literary works and art. It does cost to get in which is a little steep. They call it a tax deductible donation and I even had to pay for both of my children who are under the age of 4 and can't read lol. Still it is a very cool place to visit especially if you are into Zelda and Scott. It's really interesting to see Zelda's paintings and see their personal items and learn about different aspects of their lives. Montgomery Alabama is just a cool town to visit they have a lot to offer in a lot to do and see. This place also has an Air BnB. I don't think I could stay in this house long term because the smell of the old books and clothes is really overwhelming. I'm surprised that they don't have these items kept in a humidity controlled environment. The woman that we met who was working there was very sweet to both of our children."

   "Beautiful park with rolling hills and pretty paved walkways. We stopped here for a place to stretch our legs and let our dogs stretch theirs during the last leg of a road trip. The weather helped, but this park is spacious and lovely. Even with a dozen or so cars parked in the lot, we still.only saw a couple people since the park is so large.",
   "I've been walking here for a while I love going early in the a.m. while it's still kinda cool. Beautiful green grass and trees. Always clean. Fresh air is is a plus. The ponds are soothing.",

   "Great outdoor natural activity in Montgomery. Nice paved walk designated areas for running and walking in a great atmosphere.",

   "What a fantastic tribute to one of America's best Country Music Legends. I wish I could share photos with you but photography is not allowed. You'll hear Hank singing some of his most loved tunes along with admiring the beautiful costumes he and his wife Audrey wore to perform in. Hank's big blue Cadillac is on full display. You'll read about how he died and much about his life. There's authentic furniture from the home he shared with wife Audrey and children Hank Jr and Lucretia. What an enjoyable experience this was and I highly recommend you tour it."

   "Great place to visit with any of your family members because it's a place for adults and children. The scenery is gorgeous and there are a numerous amount of animals to view. The Mann Museum is also interesting and has a lot of fine arts and history about different animals...."

   "Calling it a park is generous, but it is quite a nice strip of grass accented by a few trees and benches, overlooking the river. \n\nI spent about an hour here with my dogs one sunny afternoon in December. We picnicked on a blanket and shared some delicious bbq from Dreamland. Then we wandered along the path there. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be a bird watching outing, but a charming mockingbird watched us for most of our meal. And a cardinal came to join it for a bit. A lovely surprise. \n\nAnd the free parking is always good.",
   "I came to this park to view train activity. While there aren't many trains, it's a wonderful vantage point. When you walk down the steps to the riverwalk there is a passenger bridge that crosses the tracks for a stellar view point.\nI brought my little westy puppy with me and because there were no dogs and it is fenced and walled in, I was able to play fetch with her. Excellent place to experience.",

   "This is a good place to take a stroll during the day or night when it's not summertime unless you like swimming in the air lol. Good view of the Alabama river and surrounding areas northward. Also a good place to view the fireworks at Biscuits stadium on fireworks night which is usually on a Friday or Saturday....sometimes both."

While we were visiting there were many families with young children everywhere and that made it even more enjoyable. \n\nThe goats!!! After we had been there about 30 minutes I was a bit disappointed in the goats or lack thereof, my son loves goats, then suddenly in the distance we could hear them bleating and there were at the very least 40 goats and kids, it was a full blown goat parade. Watching my son and all of the other children playing with them absolutely made my day.\n\nThe property is beautiful and we'll maintained, there was no goat poop everywhere, only in the small area where their feed and water is located behind the church. \n\nEveryone from the gate attendants to the campers and visitors were very nice. I can't wait to spend more days with my family in the Town of Spectre.\n\nThere is a $3.00 per person entry fee, they accept cash and credit or debit card.",

   "We went today and completely enjoyed this experience! Considering the amount and variety of animals the pricing was more than reasonable. We were feeding zebras, llamas, antelopes, water buffalo emus and other animals right from our cars! Loved feeding the giraffes, the animal petting area and aviary! Very clean facilities and park!  It's a must do!",
   "We are more than Civil Rights! I just visited one of the best kept secrets in our area! Thousands come to Montgomery to see the civil rights but we have more to offer. My recent family outing to the Safari Park  left me, no us, ranging in ages from 1-80+, truly and thoroughly engaged in God\u2019s beautiful creation. And I didn\u2019t have to leave the continent to see these exotic animals. Great, reasonably priced outing for all. A brochure is provided, with helpful information, but we were too excited to read it with all the action right there in our face. The feeding of the animals was a bit tricky at first, but we were able to get the hang of it. So if you want to see more than statues when you come to town, go to Safari Park, just miles out of Montgomery\u2019s city limits.",
   "Kangaroos in Alabama? Yes, please! We took the teens and grandkids and it was a great experience. The llamas were eager and the camels aggressively snatched a feed bucket. We fed a giraffe, listened to squawking parrots, and fed a flock of budgies. We will definitely be doing this again!",
   "The kids enjoyed it. Spent about 1.5 to 2 hours there. Not terrible for the price and they really enjoyed getting up close and personal with the animals.  The only reason I didnt give it a five was because the feed was really expensive for what you got."

   "We had a wonderful visit last year - plan to head back up again next weekend. The property owners are wonderful people. It is a nice, close and affordable getaway for us.... and of course we love the goats too!",
   "We came here to see the town of Spectre just as a funny thing to do nothing really serious and when we got out there what we thought was going to be a 10-minute stay turned into a 2-hour stay because it was beautiful they had a nice benches where you could just sit in the swing and enjoy the view and when the wind blew it was comfortable coming off the water there is a ton of goats when we came in we seen the signs to watch out for the goats and we thought it was for the movie set that was abandoned here and when we turn the corner we seem 30 goats it was just a fun cherry on top of the day. It's $3 a person to get in and they had really nice little camping spots where you can pay $10 a person we completely plan on making time to come out and camp",
   "\u201cTime stops when dreams come true before you, Time stops when fantasy is real\u201d\n       \nToday was a fantastic day, Lauren and I rented a car and drove from Louisiana to Alabama. We were headed to Jackson Lake Island or the Town of Spectre! And it was magical!                                                     Bring here was so inspiring, just to stand where Edward stood was inspirational. And I hope I can by half the adventurer he was!",
   "Very peaceful, with plenty to do: from camping to getting married! \n\nJackson Lake Island offers full site hookups for RV camping and plenty of space to pitch a tent. For those relaxing weekends, bring the boat, kayaks, and/or bikes to take leisurely cruises around the island. \n\nMany locals take advantage of the boat ramps, on Jackson Lake Island, as an entry to the Alabama River. A variety of freshwater fish continuously flow through the lake, attracting anglers as they attempt to land that big fish. Bank fishing is also permitted.\n\nThe Island is home to the Town of Spectre movie set from the film \"Big Fish\". It is fun to walk down the street to see the buildings and the shoes that are still being collected and tossed over the line. \n\nWhile visiting the movie set, it is almost guaranteed you will be greeted by a goat or two. If you have little ones, they are sure to love on them as they roam freely around the island. \n\nIn addition to the movie set and the goats, the island is made up of rolling grassy hills with a private events cabin to make the perfect space to host your special event (babyshowers, birthdays, weddings, family reunions, etc.).",
   "\"Big Fish\" is one of my favorite movies ever. When I heard that I could visit this island and see the abandoned movie set I had to make the trip from New Jersey. The entrance was easy to find and the instructions for submitting payment and calling for the gate code was super easy. The island is beautiful and full of nature. The movie set was amazing to see and walking down the street you can't help but feel like Edward Bloom in the movie. While taking some photos the goats came right over to us to see what was going on. They were very friendly and photogenic. Hahah!! It was icing on the cake for this trip. I'm so glad that we made this trip as a family."

Everyone should go, and look, and keep looking, thinking and feeling. We can\u2019t turn away from this past. If we have any hope of moving forward, we have to reckon with it.",
   "A reminder of our country\u2019s past. Less not we forget that it was not too long ago a person could be lynched just purely based on the color of their skin. Highly recommended place to visit for education on the reality of lynching in the US. Take your time and do not rush through it. Very solemn place to honor the innocent lives of Black men and women.",
   "Beautiful memorial and very emotional monument, it was heartbreaking to read real stories about how ppl were lynched back in the day for no reason other than the color of their skin. It's an eye-opener to the past and educating experience. A lot of walking, but the area was very clean and well maintained",
   "This is extremely powerful and I only saw it because the Greyhound bus I was catching to New Orleans was three hours behind. Lucky me. I am curious, do the museum have tour guides. I think that would make it much more informative and powerful. FYI, there's a museum and a bus that takes you to the memorial. I say that because I originally though the memorial was the museum.",
   "There are no words to describe this memorial! Just to view the names of the many lives lost gave me chills! It is $5 to enter. These tickets can be purchased in the gift shop just across the street from the memorial. Additionally there is a shuttle bus that runs every 10 mins back and forth from the museum to the memorial for your convenience. This memorial is a must see for all! I highly recommend!"

   "I knew from photos that this place was gorgeous outside, but I didn't realize that it was attached to a park. It was much bigger than I expected. Everywhere I turned was a new delight, from the fountain to the beautiful doors to the statues of children climbing a tree.\n\nThe play was also unique in that they played clips of interviews on old tvs from people who had been in concentration camps, but they also had actors reenacting scenes in between.\n\nAfterwards, they had a discussion about it for those who wanted to stay for that. \n\nIt was a lovely experience. Well worth the $30 ticket. I can't wait to go back!"

The guy behind the counter was friendly enough and apologetic about the machine.. The state really needs to update the  internet connection for the machine.",

Let bygones be bygones.",

From the increasing quality of the improving restoration of the original site, to the history museum and the well-documented exhibits, and the small but well-rounded and thorough library, Confederate Memorial Park does an excellent job of presenting as full a view of this portion of Alabama's history as possible."

Cancellation stations by the door when you enter for Passport programs and nation parks store next to it. \n\nThis is the National Park Visitor centre for Tuskegee Institute.

   "Very informative museum!! Most of the information is about George Washington Carver but you can also find a small portion on Booker T. Washington. Here you will find a very in depth history of Carver's life and inventions with many photos and interactive exhibits. Entrance is free. There is a restroom and bookstore that sells souvenirs. Because there are items like old dishes and a stove in hnds reach I do not recommend this museum for those with rambunctious toddlers unless they are closely supervised or in a really good stroller since no touching is allowed.",

Very short on staff right now so a drink order will take almost an hour but the place is very busy and they are doing all they can do. Very clean restrooms and good music also. Would recommend this location for a good day trip. Best chances of winning are on weekend nights. Not much luck on weekdays for us",

But the staff is always friendly, and do there absolute best to try and make sure your in good spirits.",

I haven't noticed a men's night and I never wanted jack pot looking forward to it I was receiving free play in the mail but that has stopped some parent parent reason. So the Highlight for me is the people that clean up behind all the customers I give them A good jobs well done and the greeters and I will not leave at Miss Sheila red shirt people take their jobs very serious love to be invited to play at the B.B. king Club I love eating chicken wings at the BB King Cafe that 10 piece is delicious"

   "My family and I celebrated my mother's milestone birthday last week with a dinner cruise aboard the Harriott.  We reserved an entire deck celebrating with a group of 76 family and friends.  The food was okay but the servers were awesome, constantly checking to make sure the honoree was happy -- as well as her family.\n\nOur main deck was filled with wonderful jazz and R&B music performed by Mr. John Bull & Band.  Of course we turned up with lots of laughter and dancing.  As we moved about the riverboat to the upper deck, we discovered a DJ playing pop/contemporary music.  Many of our guests danced so until they were drenched with sweat.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was when my mother got a chance to wear the captain's hat and steer the boat. The huge smile on her face from the entire evening-- as well as the smiles from our guests -- confirmed their enjoyment of everything that was offered.\n\nI would have given the riverboat a 5-star rating had it not been for the slow telephone response time by the event coordinator.  My siblings and I were coordinating this event from 2 different states outside of Montgomery, so prompt responses to our voice message(s) would have been appreciated.\n\nIn closing, I would have no problem doing another dinner cruise with this venue.   Once on the boat, the entire crew did everything they could to make sure our evening was memorable -- and fun and memorable it was!\n\nThanks again to the entire crew and I look forward to riding again.",
   "My first time visiting it was Awesome the band was great. Price reasonable., if a large group additional discount. You must give it a try",

Well worth the visit!",

When you do find something, info is incomplete. And it you don't happen to like how they do things, they could care less. So I use Ancestry and whatever else I can to keep from wasting yet another trip to Montgomery. And this is one of the better agencies in Montgomery. Edit; there is an African American lady there that is a tremendous help but she is not always available. I once asked one younger white lady that seemed in charge when the majority of Archives records would be digitized, specifically genealogy records. She said \"never.\" This is the attitude you deal with here."

   "Try the Fried Chicken Pulleys! It will be the most tender, juicy, meaty and crispy fried chicken you've ever tasted in your life!! The side portions are enough to eat half and save half. And you should save half and order a piece of pie! The coconut meringue is a tower of sweet and delightful! Don't miss this spot, foodies!",
   "OMG - don't know how to convey our absolute delight and excitement when we 'accidentally' discovered Martin's! \n\nThe food quality was exceptional, fresh, and everything delicious!  Serving sizes were HUGE!  Servers were hospitable, patient, doted on us... and encouraged us to take home what we couldn't finish. \n\nThis is a hidden, off-the-beaten-path jewel of Montgomery... a favorite of locals and tourists like me who are fortunate enough to find it!\n\nYou will NOT be disappointed. \n\nFried chicken the crispiest, freshest,  tastiest ever, anywhere in any state. Fresh veggies (black eyed peas, greens) remarkable.  Banana puddin' was worthy of #1st places in any dessert contest. \n\nHighly recommend.  :)",
   "Good small country place. Nice family atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Overall good food and good time.",
   "I couldn't have cared less about the carbs. This was my Mother's Day meal and it was worth every one of them and the calories. It's good home style cooking. And it's easy to see (and taste!) why their fried chicken was voted best in Alabama. It's some seriously good fried chicken. Portions are huge and your appetite will be too once you smell the food.",
   "Talk about seriously good hone cooking! Delicious food and servings big enough to feed 2 people. I ate 1 of the 2 whopping chicken breasts on my plate and half the 3 sides and took an equal amount of leftovers home. Will be stopping here for lunch whenever I'm passing through Montgomery."

   "Wonderful service.  My meal was a fish stew in coconut milk that had unique and rich flavors.  Clearly cooked with passion and love.  The bread pudding was flavorful and unique.  Very satisfying meal.  The restaurant was very clean and while spartan was completely welcoming. I will definitely come back next time I visit Montgomery",
   "Super cool artsy kinda funky but chill atmosphere. Service was tremendous and the breakfast? On point. Eggs perfectly fine, brisket was super moist, and everything delicious. Awesome little breakfast place",
   "04/27/2020 Fantastic food!! Was at Truckworx for service and ordered through grubhub. Food was piping hot when arrived, beautifully presented, ample portions and everything tasted oh so good!! Very unique food - plantains cooked perfectly (so sweet & delicious), black beans & rice yummy, curry chicken was not spicy and deliciously tender, and vegetable medley fresh & cooked perfectly.  Delivery was quick and driver friendly, as were staff on phone. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
   "We need more Venezuelan immigrants. This food was AMAZING and the breakfast menu looked authentically delicious. They don't use oils or fry or anything, but you couldn't tell from how much flavor was in our food. Even the water had a perfect saturation of lemon and lime!",

   "Was looking for something different than my standard lunch fare, but not to far off the beaten path. With everything that is going on, the restaurant business has been hit pretty hard,so the choices are limited. This business has changed up its model slightly by offering basic supplies/produce in addition to the menu items. What has changed is the tables for socializing at. They are no longer available. So the ambiance of this local establishment is both longer the same, the. Food is still wonderful and at a good value. Was definitely pleased with the service and the employees were polite and quick to answer any question I had.\nI've been here before a couple of times, will definitely  stop back in for another lunch and try out something else on the menu. delicious !",
   "Incredible! All your southern comfort favorites but in a fresh, low-key way--not heavy or over-the-top either. Order when you walk in and sit wherever (we chose outside on the sidewalk and it was *perfect*)--food is brought to you super fast. The Breakfast Bowl is so good...the pimento cheese getting all melted with the grits and eggs and bacon...and the cahawba burger with the crisp fried green tomatoes...can't wait to go back and try more. Really nice, friendly and inviting. Grab some local art and gifts while you're there!",
   "Very good food. Home cooking. Came out very fast. You go in, stand in line, order, then they give you a number and you take it to your table and wait. I fixed my drink, sat down, and the food was aleeady being walked out to the table. I had herb chicken, fried green tomatoes, collards, and vegetable medley. Chicken was on point. Fried green tomatoes were BEST I've ever had. Collards were good. I wasn't a big fan of the vegetable medley. Atmosphere is pretty cool. Saw the meatloaf coming out a lot and it looked amazing. French fries looked pretty good also. Definitely a plus, plus experience.",
   "Yum yum yum yum. Super good, our food came out fast, even though the drinks are self served the staff still came to the table often and it was nice. I loved it. I ordered the meat loaf sandwich, my wife had the big burger and my daughter had the chicken strips. We split some fried green tomatoes. Everyone loved their food. The price was great too, all of us food and drinks under 28 bucks. Stop in a visit these guys. You wont regret it!",
   "Fun atmosphere, nice location, good price and great food! We got the meatloaf, fried green tomatoes, collard greens, and the Cahawba Burger, among other things between the four of us and it was all great! Would come here again if we ever make it back to Montgomery!"

   "Great Mexican food and service\nWe arrived just before 6 pm on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was already full.  Luckily we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table.  The chips and salsa were great and the naked poblano (with grilled steak) was outstanding, but we thought that the vegetarian burrito was unremarkable.  We like spicy food so we loved their home made hot sauce!  Even though it was really busy, our food came out quickly and the servers were super friendly and efficient!",
   "Good restaurant and fast service. They have it figured out once you sit down. Drinks, chips and food then get out. Good Mexican food for being in Alabama. Salsa has a decent flavor and the cheese dip was great. I\u2019ll try to make it back while I\u2019m here. Thanks guys",
   "This is an excellent little spot for a quick lunch.  The menu is very reasonably priced and the food is generally excellent. I have been very impressed by the attentiveness from the wait staff, and the food leaves very little to be desired.  For those who like Mexican without the spice you can't go wrong; however if you enjoy authentically spiced Mexican you might be a little disappointed.  One note-- when ordering quesadillas I definitely recommend the beef.  The chicken is good but dries out quickly.",
   "The street tacos are epic! I had the Tinga a shrimp tacos. Spicy, but it was so worth it. My head was sweating when I finished. I would come back again."

I was very pleased with my experience here and if I'm ever in town again I'll be visiting here for sure...",

Probably be ause they were well manned for the crowd. Kudos to the wait staff, bartender, and management. Truly worked together.",
   "This is hands down the BEST restaurant in Montgomery and the State of Alabama.  The steaks are always freshly cut and cooked to perfection.  I usually order the ribeye steak cooked at medium.  This restaurant gets it right every time. I've never had to send my steak back.  The sides are always fresh and delicious as well.  Every time I make a trip to Montgomery, I always make time to have a delicious dinner at Charles Anthony's Restaurant.  Once you have dined here, you will never stop going. In addition, kudos to Carlie, the bartender.  She serves the best cocktails in Montgomery as well.  I will definitely be back soon.",
   "Fantastic food.  This little restaurant gives off a Castle, Medieval vibe with the decor.  Destiny our lovely waitress was so helpful.  I had left my glasses in the vehicle so she got a couple of spare pair for me to utilize while perusing the menu.  I chose the Grilled Red Snapper with Lump Crabmeat.  Everything was exceedingly delicious and meticulously prepared.",
   "Very good food. The service was great. I had the ribeye steak and it was good. The sea base was good and had a good sauce. Very busy but the food was served in a timely manner and very good service. I ordered a drink and it took 12 minutes to get to the table and they comp it. I did not ask for the comp. Just great management. This place cares about your experience. The salad dressing was delicious. It  was  Greek Balsamic and it was so good, I asked for more and poured it on my steak."

We decided on fried chicken with corn and mac n cheese, smothered chops over rice with collards and mac n cheese, and ox tail over rice with cabbage and broccoli casserole. Everything was so good!! Only downside was that it was a bit warm for us inside as we ate but that's purely a personal preference.",

The area and ambience definitely could use a lot of work but the nostalgic pictures, food and good service makes up for it!",

I actually worked here 25 years ago before I started my current career. The owners and employees have always been nice and friendly. The food is pretty good across the board for breakfast lunch and dinner. Prices I think are a little higher than say Cracker Barrel but not over exorbitant. The menu has a wide variety of choices from soups, sandwiches, salads and healthier choice items. It\u2019s a great place to go when you have kids as they have several items for the picky eaters to choose from. I would recommend Chappy\u2019s as a local deli favorite to anyone coming into town who want to avoid the typical chain places to go. It usually doesn\u2019t disappoint.",

My Sis and I were thankful for the presence of numerous uniformed law enforcement officers. There was plenty of local friends chattering, to add a homie touch to the breakfast.",

We decided to stay and try it anyway. The waiter was super nice and very knowledgeable about the offerings. We ordered the scamp, oysters, and shrimp. We shared bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream for dessert. ALL delicious! The portions were perfect. The most satisfying part were the people. Couples stopped by our table and bragged on the food, gave my daughter compliments, and even gave us tips on what to try. It\u2019s true... don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. We\u2019ll definitely return.",

   "Jubilee Seafood was recommended by a friend. I had the blackened Redfish dinner special which was excellent. Also had a half dozen raw oysters for an appetizer, which were rather small, but very good. The wait staff members were very attentive and provided excellent service.

   "The chicken and waffles is incredible. Perfect amount of sweet and hot (they drizzle some syrup on the waffle and put a hot sauce on the chicken). Also it's the perfect amount of crispy for both the waffle and chicken. Comes with a little fruit cup on the side. The portion is huge though so you better come hungry! My boyfriend got the artisan power salad with grilled shrimp and balsamic dressing and that was great too.",
   "Excellent food excellent service in a very cool unique cabin-like sports feel! Already planning my future visit.  Not a huge fan of desserts, but the Fried Banana Pudding is a must.  Check this place out!",
   "The smothered chicken dish was good. It has bacon on it as well. Loved the rice also. Lots of TVs so you won't miss any games",
   "This is the second Baumhower's location I have been to and their customer service is top notch.  We went prior to attending show at nearby Alabama Shakespeare theater Christmas performance and were warmly welcomed.  While it's a sports bar theme restaurant it is great for everyone and doesn't have sound blasting which allows you to carry on a conversation.   I had the All American cheeseburger and split it with my wife as well as the grilled chicken salad she ordered.  Both were very good.  Couple we were with had the Hot Brown.  Definitely a must.  They raved about it."

   "Upscale dining with a \"twist\"! The ambiance & lighting sets the mood for a great evening. Celebrate for two or host a business accomplishment with your business partners. Stop by Bonefish soon and don't forget to try the \"Bang-Bang\" Shrimp Appetizer...for it is Amazing!",
   "I went out to eat with my friend.. This was my first time eating here the food was amazing. The drinks were excellent!! Staff were very friendly and prices were on point. I will definitely be back again",
   "Food, beverage, and service were great. Tiffany did a great job. I've always enjoyed dining here for dinner, but this brunch indulgence will start to happen more often.",
   "The employees were very nice, as was the ambiance. I must say the food was a little disappointing, though. My French toast was tasty but hard, maybe due to the type of bread that was used. They gave me cold syrup to go with it. In fact, everything but the syrup and the fruit was lukewarm at best when I got it. I just expected better.",
   "Top-notch food and service. My eldest son, a USAF pilot, came into town from Colorado for a couple days for a visit,  and I took him and his younger brother, my other son, to Bonefish Grill. We were kinda late getting out to eat, but everyone was so friendly and attentive. It was 45 minutes until closing, but no one made us feel rushed or mean mugged us like we were slowing them from getting out early. The food was superb. Of course we started with Bang-Bang shrimp. My guys had steak and seafood, and I had a gnocchi with something like a lobster and seafood alfredo sauce with their brussels and bacon side. Both my boys and I were impressed with everything on our plates. Thanks for a great evening Bonefish Grill!"

   "I would like to rate this restaurant 4.5. The chicken 65 is awesome. Chicken biriyani was good but the tandori chicken was below expectation level. \nAnother sad thing is that only chicken is halal here. Other meats are not halal.",
   "Excellent food. Amazing customer service. I have eaten there many times before but tonight it was exceptionally good. The palak paneer was perfectly prepared. The chicken vindaloo was exquisitely done. Delivered in roughly 30 minutes. Keep up the great work!!!",
   "We found this restaurant just off the interstate near Montgomery while looking for vegan & vegetarian options. We showed up just before they ended the lunch service but they were very friendly & seated us without hesitation. The food was all great & I appreciate that the vegetarian dishes are kept separate from the meat dishes, making it that much easier for us to eat animal-free.",
   "The best Indian restaurant in the local area. Atlanta may have better ones and I'm still trying different ones in Birmingham but this is the best I've had within 2 hours driving. They have a lunch buffet when they are open for lunch and perfect if you have not tried Indian food before. Grab a little of everything and see what you like. Be sure to get some raita(yogurt, also on the buffet and regular menu) in case something is too spicy for you. The staff is very helpful so feel free to ask them questions."

Also they don't do well with giving out the biscuits and we stayed waiting on them. I do like that I can buy my own biscuit mix from Winn-Dixie and Piggly Wiggly stores.",

I would absolutely go here again.",

Obviously the flavor of the grill takes this burger to another level.  Oh yeah, and the rest of the food seems great, so I keep hearing.  I just can't stop ordering the burger.  They also have a fine selection of drinks.",

Close to downtown and in the heart of Old Cloverdale's Historical District \u2014 it's convenient and feels like home. Not to mention it shares space with one of the best coffee shops and bakeries in Montgomery. Stop by Tomatinos the next time you are in the area. You will not regret it.",
   "Wonderful pizza with a side of acceptable service. I have been a fan of this place longer than a decade and since I first started going the service had usually been good but never great. The pizza however has always been excellent (though in my opinion it doesn't travel or reheat well). In it's new location it lacks the hole in the wall charm it used to have but kept the art. I would recommend trying it and forming your own opinion and ignoring what constitutes mine.",

   "A lovely little secluded spot of Montgomery that is the perfect spot to unwind and have a drink.  The beer selection here is truly spectacular, from everything on tap to the wide selection of homegrown brews that are posted on the top shelf of the bar.  The food is not gourmet but it is quite delicious and appropriate for the environment. I had the BLT which was cutely cute into a heart.  An underrated aspect of this place's ambience and charm is their decor and musical selection.  There is a homely seating area in the corner (sofa, chairs, lamps, & tables) for those intimate conversations. A nice touch. There is also plenty of outdoor seating,  in the summer time this becomes their greatest allure.  The soundtrack ( my last visit was at noon on a Saturday) made me feel as if I was back in my childhood and my mother just turned on the Golden Oldies station so we could promptly clean the entire house. I was comfortable instantaneously. I've never had an issue with service,  Rebecca was a gem. I've never visited this establishment at night but if you want a place with great ambience,  a good bite to eat,  and simultaneous homely/chic feeling then look no further.",
   "Really fun little place. Good food and drinks. Outdoor eating. Kids love the hill. Trivia nights. And lots more.",
   "I was in town for a conference and came here with some co-workers. They serve crafted beers and you will not be disappointed. The food are fairly priced, though the southwestern sandwich and the nachos I ordered were a bit salty.  They are located in a very nice and modern side of town and they're space is modern, inviting, and clean. Overall we had a great experience with this gastropub and would recommend it to anyone local or visitors!",
   "Such a great way to unwind after the week. Sit outside, enjoy the drafts, flatbread, trio of dips. Service is excellent. I love the relaxed atmosphere and though I have sat inside a few times, nothing beats the spring afternoon weather and a local spot to enjoy a draft (even if it is cider). My go to for an early start to excellent weekends!",
   "Laid back environment, matter-of-fact staff that works quickly to meet requests, even in slower spurts. Live music was a great experience. Newcomer to the area."

The cake was delicious as well. I definitely would recommend this place. I went back yesterday to try their cheesecake and was pleased with that as well :)",

Nothing really bad, but of everything we ordered, the side salad was the best food we had. They could definitely benefit from a little revitalization in the kitchen.",

They, unlike many venues in this area, have realized that reasonable prices for superb food and service are key for a successful business that people would want to come back to for more! What a great concept! Meal & service was hands down THE BEST we have had in this city.",

   "Hands down the best restaurant in Montgomery. The place that turned me into a foodie! My dad  brought me to City Grill for the first time 17 years ago. I have been a repeat customer ever since. The quality of the food and service is always excellent. I've traveled and enjoyed fine dining in larger cities like Nashville, Memphis, Birmingham, Atlanta, New York, and Chicago. City Grill remains one of my top favorites and could complete in any of the above cities. The chef is an artist. He treats the food with care and respect. Each plate is a work of art held to the highest of standards. Freshness is a top priority. The portions are large enough to meet southern expectations and are ample for the price. If you are visiting Montgomery I would recommend this place over both Central and La Jolla."

   "We stopped by here during a road trip. Picked this spot due to the excellent reviews. I really wanted some good wings so we ordered those as appetizers. About 12 for $11. The wings were delicious. You could taste the smoked flavor and the BBQ sauce was all throughout the flavoring. It wasn\u2019t like some places where they cook the wings, dip in sauce and send them out. I highly recommend the wings. \n\nFor entrees I had the chicken fried chicken and hubby had the pulled pork Cuban. My sides were Mac and cheese and gumbo. Hubby had collars greens and fries. My chicken fried chicken was cooked perfectly and the white gravy was good. The Mac and cheese was okay. It was super cheesy but not really seasoned. I mean it was good but not like grandma\u2019s cooking good. Hubby liked the gumbo (okra based) and greens. No complaints there. \n\nOur fries came out a lot later than the food but they were hot and fresh and tasted okay. \n\nWaitress was nice. \n\nThe only reason I\u2019m deducting a star is due to cleanliness. It was trash everywhere all over the floor and tons of tables that weren\u2019t bussed. They weren\u2019t even busy. Employees were standing around talking or folding napkins. I mean it was a lot of trash on the floor. It really detracted from the decor. The other thing was it was sooooo humid inside. Every time someone came in and left a nice breeze came through but other than that it was hot as heck. I\u2019m a normally cold person and I had to use my menu to fan. \n\nIt was no circulation because of that either. \n\nAll in all I would definitely return again if I was in the area.",
   "Food was excellent. I asked the waitress what she suggested and the first thing out of her mouth was the pot roast. She couldnt have been more right! You could tell from every part of the meal that everything in the establishment was good. Prices were superb also!! Would definitely make this place a regular if I were a local.",

   "Discovered this breakfast place on a recent trip to Montgomery. Reviews were great so I decided to check it out. Reviews did not disappoint. Food was delicious. Service was great. Mama\u2019s not around anymore but when I asked the owners they said they were all \u201cMama\u201d which I could appreciate having been raised in the south. Tough to leave here hungry.",

I ended up with these little steak wraps that were delicious and that my daughter kept stealing off my plate. The coleslaw with the feta cheese was also great.

It has a pretty chill vibe, and a good staff.  \n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone, but I would also tell them that it took a little longer than expected to get our food.  That's not a bad thing, but it's definitely something I want to know before I'm looking at my watch wondering where my food is.",
   "I love the Oysters Rockefeller, try it out!  My brother isn't a seafood guy so he ordered the ribeye not having high expectations given the specialty of the restaurant. We were both blown away at the amazing flavor of that steak! I have yet to find a better Oyster house that's not on the coast."

   "If your from Montgomery and your looking for a good soul food spot you come here. Their menu is via Facebook but you can also call the number listed for the audio menu as well. Prices have become steep over the years but portions and food are good. Desserts are extra and for the price should be included with a drink. Expect to spend $15 on a meal each. Wait time varies as during lunch you can expect to wait for up to an hour in the buffet line that is not self serviced. Also be sure to not be on your phone as they won\u2019t service you otherwise. People are generally nice but it\u2019s a face pace space so it\u2019s good to know what you want ahead of time before arriving.",

They have good beers too, plenty of Alabama options. \n\nAnd do make sure to have the banana pudding. I haven\u2019t had a good banana pudding in years, very nostalgic.\n\nIt does get really crowded-we are at the bar, which worked perfectly, but if you want a table, call ahead or be ready for a wait. There\u2019s a decent amount of street parking nearby.",
   "What a wonderful find in downtown Montgomery!  A great barbecue restaurant with super customer service and delicious food, especially the ribs!  It also offers a nice selection of in-house, local, and bottled beer,  plenty of TVs to watch the games, as well as ample seating. Their barkeep, Amanda, took great care of us and never left us hanging! Will definitely be back for more!!",
   "The spicy rib wrap and mac n cheese were delicious. Felicia was a lovely server. The hotbox honey porter from Railway brewery went very well with the wrap. The bread pudding was to die for. Would love to visit this place again--excellent southern BBQ!",
   "Absolutely phenomenal location. One of the absolute best places I've had the pleasure of dining at. Extremely high quality food, enormous portions all for a fantastic price. Our server was Cindy and she was the sweetest woman ever, and took the time to go over several menu items and provide suggestions and talk to us. A truly enjoyable experience as the establishment has a rich history and wonderful aesthetic. Thank you for providing the four of us this experience, as we won't forget it during our road trip.",
   "Awesome BBQ with friendly service! The place was packed but within a couple minutes they seated us. We had combo plates with big meaty ribs, pulled pork and chicken with sides of potato salad, baked beans, and fried okra. We were unsure of their BBQ sauce so they offered to put it on the side. It's a little tangy/spicy but good. This is definitely a place we'll return to."

   "Had an early dinner here tonight.  The place is modern and doesn\u2019t look like a Mexican place at all.  The staff was pretty good and the food came out quickly. I had the fish tacos - that\u2019s the reason for the 3 score - the fish tasted horrible.  It had a bad flavor. Other than that, the salsa is amazing along with the Mexican Street corn - that was fantastic.  The food was well-presented and other than the fish. It was good. Also, pretty pricey - was just me and I only had a Pepsi, so no alcohol and it was $30 before tip.\n\nI would go back, but next time get the fried chicken.\n\nUpdate- I went back and had the fried chicken.  I think maybe the cook was having and off night, because, sadly, it was overcooked.  Again, however, the sides were the star of the show. Some sort of smashed and fried potato with brown sugar and got the street corn again. The fried chicken comes with a nice little palate cleansing vinegar doused veggie mix and the vinegar and habanero sauce to put on the chicken is really super.",
   "Stopped in for a work lunch...name sparked my interest. The nachos are AMAZING! So many flavors coming together.",
   "Heard so much about this place. Salsa was great, food and service was ok, but the a/c was out and apparently had been out for a while because there was a portable unit up front by the reception area. Will have to try it again when that problem is solved.",
   "I've been a frequent at Little Donkey since it opened a few years ago. Overall, I've never had a bad experience. The staff is always cheerful and a pleasure to be around (even when my two 2-year-old twins are going crazy). \n\nThe food is delicious, creative, and a good price. By far some of the best places in Montgomery. We will continue to come here so long as they don't mind the occasional flipped drink from a 2-year-old. \n\nKeep up the good work!",
   "Casual, bright atmosphere...good choice if you are shopping in Eastchase or passing through  Montgomery (right off 85). REALLY enjoyed the guacamole...would have been happy making a meal off of that! Tight quarters in the restaurant but they do have outside seating. Nice beer and cocktail options (I enjoyed the \"sparkling\" margarita with added Prosecco \ud83d\ude0a). Will be going back for a second visit!"

($9.99+ tax) a little high for meat & 2... my opinion, was good. Wasn't a big fan of butter peas due to seasoning used when cooking. Food was hot, tasted fresh & server was attentive & asked several times if I needed anything.\nI've gone to this \"same building as a restaurant\" for over 25+ years & watched it change. By far this is the best physical condition I've ever seen in. 1st meal today since its changed owners so can't compare food to the old Sundown East.

It was this dirty blond haired guy with long painted fingernails and he was awesome. We ended up having a decent conversation with him and, because we stayed so long, he gave the person I was with a free lemonade right before they closed. He was so funny and so friendly. I wish waiters everywhere would be like him.",
   "Eat at the Mellow Mushroom. \n\nThis place was a unique experience that I did not regret. They had a nice range of beer selection, a reasonable sized menu, and just phenomenal service.  When I hear about co-workers coming to Montgomery, this will be on my list of musts. \n\nI live in Europe, and love the pizza there. The crust, the sauce, the overall composition deliver a flavorful bite everytime.  The Mellow Mushroom gives an American version of that very same idea. The toppings were a lot more plentiful, but every bite was an explosion of flavor. \n\nThe service was great! The bartender was incredibly helpful and recommended the half and half option when I asked about two different options.",

You board the bus, go to the back and put your order in. There are a few seats inside or you can sit in the covered area outside.  The portion sizes are substantial, the food is fresh, the flavor is great, the service relatively quick if you don't have too large of a group! It's a win-win situation.",

   "Food was fantastic, spiced just right, and extremely flavorful. Had a live band playing great classic music. Good vibes and a down home type of place.",
   "My wife and I 1st time and we enjoyed. Now we have to go back with the family... I know my mom would love it.",
   "We  asked to be seated at a different table than the hostess wanted (wanted to see music). She was rude and had an attitude. We wanted to order alcohol so she would send over a waitress since she was underage. She never explained that and seemed to get more rude when we were at first confused . No one came, never acknowledged that we were even in the restaurant. I believe the hostess set this up with the waitresses. After 30 minutes of no one making eye contact or speaking we left. Other people who came in after us were waited on. When I approached the hostess about getting some service she just stared at me.  Life is too short to be treated so rudely on a special night out. Jubilee Seafood got our more than $100 tab and were more than gracious. Needless to say we won\u2019t be returning to Jans Seafood.",
   "Checked online at 11:00 am for daily lunch special, roast beef was one of the meats. Arrived at Jan's around 12:15 and roast beef was crossed off as one of the meats for lunch special. Took 10 minutes before waitress came to take order. We placed order and received salad in about 5 minutes after another 15 minutes waitress came over and told  us they were out of the mash potatoes we ordered that was it!! We left!! The roast beef that was online as a lunch special meat that wasn't available, then out of mashed potatoes!! Jan's has gone down hill since it first opened. Hadn't been there in a couple of months because service was slow last time we went now running out of food. Jan's is crossed off as a place to eat. 11/12/2019",
   "Thank you so much for making my great -Aunt\u2019s 99th birthday wonderful! We had so many family members and your waitresses were able to take care of everyone in a timely manner.  We appreciate everything so much!  Your food was delicious!"

Ordered some chicken wings which was not to my liking because it smelled like chicken however it tasted good. It's a nice place to grab a quick meal. Satisfied!",
   "We got a chance to eat here . I must say dont let the interior turn you away.  When i walked in,  i literally forgot that I was in Alabama,  as they really did a good job embodying the essence and culture of New York!  The staff were all very kind and food is made fresh !",
   "The food was GREAT!! If you need a quick bite for good prices, come here. You will leave happy and full. There seems to be limited seating tho so be wary of that. 10/10",
   "Excellent food!! Love the gyro burger and falafel. All their food is prepared well and very tasty. The staff is very nice and polite. They also have a food truck that travels around Montgomery. If you're in Montgomery and don't know where to eat go to NYCGyro and you won't be disappointed."

   "Surprised me how good this was. I guess there is a reason its famous. I was skeptical...the place is a true dive. To be honest, it didn't look very appetizing either. The famous hot dog is chili and sauerkraut. I reluctantly took a bite. Turns out it is very tasty!! I have been to famous hot dog joints all over and this one is right up there. Set your expectations tho. This place is the definition of \"dive\".\n\nOne more note. The staff was super sweet and that surprised me. I expected them to be indifferent like these kind of places often are but they weren't. The owner (manager?) chatted me up, asked where I was from, etc. - the counter help (woman), made sure I had what i needed.\n\nI am impressed. I was very skeptical but if the place is good enough for Presidents and celebrities...well it was worth having an open mind.",
   "Chris\u2019 Hogs was absolutely amazing. It\u2019s a small hole in the wall with good food and great service. My Husband and I was visiting Montgomery from Charlotte, NC and stop by for a great hot dog and to visit the historical restaurant that\u2019s been around 103 years. The servers greeted us with a smile and the owner came out to introduce himself and tell us about the history of the restaurant. Love this place.",
   "Outstanding food from a place that has served everyone from hank Williams to sitting presidents. The chili sauce is a bit sweet but balances perfectly with the salty dog and sour kraut. Do yourself a favor and ignore the cleanliness and enjoy some good food.",
   "It's an old historic place. A different twist on hot dogs and burgers..  a little messy, but it was good food. \n\nThe staff members were polite and my server went above and beyond what I expect from a server even in up scale places.  I was please with the experience.  No complaints",
   "Amazing food and amazing staff! They were so friendly even though we came in late and they were probably ready to go home! Our server was fantastic and made sure everything was up to par! The burger I got was the best I've had in a while! Congrats on 100 years!"

   "Service was great as usual. Chef was very entertaining. Food was good, although nothing spectacular. As a matter of fact, I believe this time around it was slightly over-seasoned. The filet that was requested medium temperature was well-done and had a mushy texture to it. The rice had a slight char to it in places. But overall it was pretty good."

I'm open to change and willing to adapt, but with new help comes training. It seems they are in a perpetual training state. Our orders have been continually incorrect due to this. Despite making this known to management it, coupled with generally poor service, it continues to happen. Not only this, but they are inconsistent with how they honor their commitment to the discount cards. Myself and many co-workers have had this continual experience in which there is nothing posted anywhere or exclusion on the Bear discount card (that I purchased mainly to give SB more business) to say you don't get the discount on a lunch special. I'm continually disappointed as are many I work with. Until Paul changes things, we'll have to remove this from our lunch rotation.",

I had the chicken satay which is awesome.  The sauce and the cucumber salad was very good.  I also had the chicken massaman which was also very good.",

I'm addition to that the spring rolls are also amazing. To top it off the staff is very friendly and attentive. Every time we visit Montgomery, Lek's is a must stop for our family.",
   "We absolutely enjoyed everything. The restaurant was full and looked like they had quite a few regulars. Service was prompt and wait staff were very friendly. \n\nWe ordered and the food was brought to the table quickly. \nI ordered the red curry, medium spicy with chicken and Thoroughly enjoyed every bite. \n\nThe chicken was very tender and I was impressed with how large the chunks of white meat were. \n\nMy father had the basil with beef and very much enjoyed the flavor and consistency of the brown sauce. \n\nWe also ordered two cups of the coconut soup with shrimp and were so impressed at the freshness of the shrimp. The soup had amazing tangy flavor and each cup came with three large shrimp! \n\nWorth the money for sure.",
   "The staff was very friendly and answered our questions and helped us decide what to order. I got the spiciest curry option they had, but personally didn't think it was super spicy. It was very delicious though. I really liked the Thai Tea as well.",
   "A dining experience! I read the reviews and had to check this place. My daughter and I stopped in and were asked if we had reservations. We said no and were told they would have no openings for another 2 hours, but that there were two openings at the bar. So we headed to the bar.When you read the menu, your taste buds will start to dance. Everything sounds amazing. We ordered drinks and a few apps. When the food was served, now your eyes are dancing."

They are scrumptious and I cherish them. Best bakeshop around the local area. They keep the espresso decent and basic however despite everything I like it. \n\nThe place is additionally astonishing. The landscape and the aroma. It truly loosens up you when you go there. The place is likewise pleasant and slick. The staffs were astonishing. They were decent and pleasing. Not surprisingly for a bakeshop. \n\n5 stars for Shashy's Bakery and Fine Foods. Will truly prescribe this bakeshop to my companions.",

The cheese biscuits were to die for! Not to mention they have a bakery full of mouth watering pastries. I had to grab a cookies and cream cinnamon roll on the way out. Wow!",
   "The real star of this restaurant is the bakery. The baked goods are amazing. We ate breakfast here for the first time recently. We both got Western omelettes. I felt my omelette was a bit undercooked and had weird vegetables in it. I expected onions, green peppers and maybe mushrooms. There were orange peppers, red peppers and not much cheese instead. The cheese grits were good and the homemade white bread was terrific. Our waitress was the sweetest, kindest young lady, and very efficient, even though she was basically running the restaurant alone. The cook appeared to berate her, where we could hear, for allowing us to substitute the cheese in our omelettes. Maybe I heard wrong, but she definitely was arguing with our poor waitress. They have an extensive lunch menu I'm looking forward to trying.",
   "Breakfast Thursday morning was great. Food cooked just right. Service was friendly and helpful.  Thank you Bo. Lunch Monday was even better. Loved the Silver Dollar sandwichs with fried Green tomatoes / bacon and the  smoked pork loin. Shrimp Gumbo was awesome! Loved that I got to met the owner, thank you for the wonderful service. Atmosphere was calming but busy. Desserts, I can't say enough. They are awesome! We'll be stopping by again. "

The sushi rolls are small for the price, but pretty good. The sushi (2 piece per order) are tiny for the price.  Overall, food quality is good, though. The service is akin to a Chinese buffet.

   "If you are looking for one of the most tender, flavorful steaks at reasonable prices, you can\u2019t go wrong with Texas Roadhouse. I am a steak lover and I have found that many of the high class steak restaurants I\u2019ve been to before are a disappointment when you realize how much you\u2019ve paid for a sub-par steak. Not at Texas Roadhouse. While you can choose a tougher cut of steak that may not be as good, the 8 oz. Dallas Filet is now my \u201cgo-to\u201d on every trip here. It\u2019s always cooked perfect, tender and flavorful. The baked potatoes are always fresh and fluffy and their salad that comes with the meal is chock full of cheese, chopped eggs, tomatoes and croutons. Unlike many other restaurants that fling iceberg lettuce in a small bowl and throw it on your table. Our visit this night was about a 20 minute wait for two people which is expected on a busy Friday night. Many people with larger groups did have to wait considerably longer. Though they have a large parking area, it stays busy and can sometimes be difficult to find a space. Our waitress was cordial and professional, got us what we needed when we needed it but was not necessarily that friendly like most waitresses we encounter. They have there tasty roasted peanuts to curb your hunger while you wait. As with many, the delicious, hot rolls are something to die for when served with their cinnamon butter. This location has consistently been good with their food and service and I highly recommend them for a great meal. I had already started in on my meal for the photo but the presentation of both the salad and main course were on point.",
   "Stopped by on Saturday for a bite on my way home. Couldn't decide what I wanted so I had the sampler appetizer. It was dry, bland and anything but exciting. My last two experiences here left me shacking my head. I probably won't be going back.",
   "Fabulous dinner. Porterhouse and filet were perfectly cooked. Steamed broccoli perfect. Salads were fresh and in chilled bowl. Waitress was top notch. Personable and did a great job. Will definitely return.",
   "The service has always been good to me here and I love the food. I would HIGHLY recommend the fried sirloin steak plate. It's fantastic! The atmosphere here is friendly and fun and a great place for a group of 1 to 100. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys \"cowboy food\" as my family calls it!"

There is the normal hibachi area for larger parties, a section with regular restaurant tables, and a bar area.  \n\nMy first experience was take out.  My second was in-restaurant at a table for lunch (did not use hibatchi).  Both times, it seemed like I should have had soup according to the menu, and both times I did not get it.\n\n** PS. I have eaten here 3 times.  They said they no longer serve soup - suggest removing that from the menu or adding another side to compensate.\n\nOtherwise, it is a good place to eat.",
   "Food was delicious but heavy on rice. Fried rice was not typical. It had less flavor and lacked additional ingredients such as egg and carrots and peas. Salad was watery but dressing was still good and portion was a bit small. Would prefer more salad and less rice. Vegetables and meat were the star for sure. Tender and tasty, fresh, hot, and little to no wait. We definitely go back. Service was kind too.",
   "Excellent food! War Eagle roll was delicious. Steak and shrimp habachi was great! Child friendly atmosphere. Will return!",
   "Went there for the first time to celebrate my birthday. The amount of food you get is incredible. Everyone uses carry out trays. The food was\"good\".",
   "Excellent tepenyaki steakhouse. The food was wonderful with the seasoning just right. The sashimi was great. The service was top tier."

   "Very Excellent food. Excellent service. Big buffet. I never expected they are bring this much of big buffet and more options. I give 5 \u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcab.",
   "One of the nicest buffet restaurants so far. Foods are fresh (we arrived around 11am) and  clean. Price is ok and gives military ID discount.",
   "I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. There's an incredibly large selection of food and not all of it is Asian food. There's a few different types of pastas, crawfish, a place where you can get steak, and many other options that most smaller Asian buffet style restaurants don't have. The price is also very reasonable. I believe it's between $8 and $12 depending on when you go and if you very a drink.",
   "Best place in town. They have everything! Even pizza, fried chicken, roast, yeast rolls and ribs. My favorite part is that sushi bar, very clean and kept up. Great staff! My mother love the ice cream",
   "This eating establishment is GREAT! Their staff is very helpful and friendly. They have just about anything you want to eat there and all their food tastes great. I especially like their selection of sushi."

   "Me and the wife had a wonderful time. Good music good food. BBQ shrimp and crab cakes were wonderful.I had the land and sea which was tender steak, red snapper, and shrimp. My wife had a shrimp noddle dish. Probably the best restaurant in Montgomery. Pricey, but worth a good time with the wife.",

   "The food was pretty good. We were grateful  to have it next to our hotel while traveling through. Not much atmosphere,  but the service was good. The only issue was there was one thing in our seafood hot pot that turned our stomachs a little, (they called it \"fish eggs\" but I'm pretty sure it was some type of testacles- you can see it in the photo) but hey,  it's authentic,  right?  Otherwise, no problems and the food was good and reasonably priced.",
   "We found this place on accident, but glad we did!  Daughter loves kimbab, and it was amazing.  Food is a little pricey for dinner, so we might try lunch next time.  Very clean and service was excellent.",

   "Just take a look at my pics from the place and how good it all looked. I have no complaints whatsoever.",
   "Always delicious. I love the small (free) appetizer plates they bring before your meal arrives. Poor table next to us were first timers and that they had to make their own soup out of it."

   "This restaurant was so good. I wish it was closer to my house. Food was hot, delicious and brought out quickly. I highly recommend the Seafood! Service was friendly and helpful. Thanks for a wonderful meal!",
   "I wasn't expecting this place to be anything special, but I was surprised! I ordered the grilled pork tenderloin with a sweet potato. It was a simple, yummy dish. My friend ordered the fried pork chop with mashed potatoes and fried okra! Her dish was amazing. The pork chop was beautifully breaded. I wanted to eat her food too! The customer service could have been better, but our server was likely just overwhelmed by our large party. It's a must-visit spot. \n\nIt should be noted that I was able to stay in Whole30 guidelines and eat at this restaurant.",
   "Nice place. Great staff. Have eaten here many times and never had a bad meal. You may have to wait for food or table if they are busy, but that's anywhere. Food is good and very reasonably priced.",
   "Food was good. Service was even better. Great atmosphere. People are friendly and have great attitudes. Server was amazing!",
   "Good meat and three . The type everyone likes in Montgomery so there is a line waiting on Sundays."

   "It was my first visit and it was amazing! The atmosphere was very lowkey and inviting. Our server angie was awesome. I had crab claws, and chicken carbonara. Everything was cooked to perfection. This is definitely a new go to spot.",
   "We were assigned two waiters and a waitress in the Private Party Dining Room. They were superb!!!",
   "I am from Arkansas but came here after church on Easter with Amy fianc\u00e9, I cannot begin to explain the incredible vibe inside, I felt like I was in a big city in the 80s, possibly early 90s and this place is like a time capsule, I felt so comfortable, the place is very clean, and relaxing, white cloth on the table tops, very romantic atmosphere, candles lit in the corners, dim lights. Wonderful! The food.... absolutely incredible!! Even my daughter loved it all!! She couldn\u2019t stop eating my wings, and I couldn\u2019t stop eating her Brie bites.  The artichoke dip needs a little more flavor. But everything was incredible and I\u2019ll definitely be back.",
   "The service here is pretty good. Everyone is friendly and helpful. I was impressed with that aspect of it. Sinclairs has a designated smoking section and also a lower level for large parties. The menu is pretty diverse. it is just not burgers but also pasta dishes and a few other different items. The prices are reasonable for what you get. The food is about average in taste. I would go back to try a few more items on the menu.",
   "We were there for an after graduation dinner for my niece. Very nice quiet and private room. The food was delicious. I had a turkey sandwhich with bacon and avocado. And I tasted my wifes shrimp quesadilla and my daughter's pizza. Rven the coffee was great. I cant wait to go back to Montgomery for a visit."

   "Honestly they weren't the friendliest people but they were polite. Now for the real important part!!! I ordered dumplings and honey wings with white rice. Food was awesome!! The dumplings were so good my eyes closed while eating them for some odd reason. The honey wings were cooked to my liking and just plain great. I gave them 4 stars because of their food. Took a star off because customer service is important! Please smile more makes your customers feel more welcomed.",
   "I hated it.  The rice was super greasy and was not good.  I couldn't believe that it was bad as it was.   They need to learn from the American deli employees  (who aren't even Chinese ) how to fry rice.  Very basic part of eating Chinese food..... decent rice",
   "Food was a little bit above standard. I ordered shrimp and broccoli with heavy sauce. I got 3 shrimp exactly and a ton of broccoli with no extra brown sauce as requested. Egg roll was perfect and crispy without being too thick and hard like some places.",
   "One of the best chinese places I've eaten from in Montgomery thus far.The portion and prices are EXCELLENT!IT'S A MUST TRY !",
   "Great food. Always made fresh to order. Love the House Lo Mein!"
