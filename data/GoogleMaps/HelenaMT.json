   "Awesome! Amazing that a church of this magnitude was built in rustic Montana in the early 1900's. Stunning stained glass with a notable origin.  Take the tour when it's offered to best experience it. Great place to sit and pray.",
   "Very beautiful! No timings online and when we went the doors were locked and no one was around. We really wanted to see the inside.",
   "This is the most gorgeous cathedral! Definitely worth a visit regardless of your faith!",
   "It was breathtaking to walk inside and see this place.  You can see it towering above the town from almost anywhere in town.  It's great that the let anybody walk in and see it.  There is art and decoration on every square inch of the outside and inside of the building.",

   "Great Northern Carousel is a fantastic place to bring children and enjoy some of the local ice cream flavors.  The local flavor is huckleberry, seldom seen anywhere else, and they have all the classic favorites, too.  The carousel is in doors and can be enjoyed regardless of changing weather.  There are seats for 40 riders, with various fantastic real and mythical animals, all artfully rendered, as well as a teacup style spinning seat for four and a loveseat.  There is a small gift shop with toys, stuffed animals, and stylized t-shirts to keep as mementos of your visit.  Tokens for the carousel are $2 each, but you receive an extra 20% on purchases of $20 or more.",
   "This is such a good place to stop as a family. The employees have always been friendly, the ice cream is Montana made and delicious, and the carousel is a blast for the kids. Rides are $2 a go for all ages and there are plenty of fun characters to choose from.",
   "Totally fun place to be! I used to bring my son here for ice cream and carousel rides when he was little. We both rode the carousel and had a blast!",
   "So fun!  Even to ride the carousel as an adult and get scoop icecream.  There was an outdoor large musical instruments to keep kids busy.  While I was there, a dog training business was having a session in the grass area.  So fun to watch all the different breeds of doggies running around while we had our icecream.",
   "It's a great place for kids and adults to have fun with their kids. Riding on the carousel is only $2, they except cash, debit or credit card and with cash you need exact change. It's free for a baby I believe up to 3 yrs to go on but they need to have an adult with them that does have to pay for themselves. They have icecream and soda there and a lot of room. There is also a nice long walking area with eateries and instruments you can play out side. There are right next to the Exploration Works which is a cool science building all ages can go through, haven't been there yet but I'm going. It's a good time for kiddos there."

   "This is an awesome children's museum in the heart of Helena.  We stayed at the Best Western right next to this and the famous carousel and suffice to say it was a huge success.  This place has lots of random cool educational things for kids to do.\n\nSome of my favorites were the water features including a tsunami simulator and trying to build buildings that could withstand the force of a tsunami (spoiler alert, many things don't and can't and that's the point).  They have the same concept for earthquakes as well which is just as interesting.\n\nUpstairs they have a more relaxed playing area but it includes a funny feature where you put bands on your head and your brain waves move a ping pong ball type object.  I can't tell how this works or if it's staged, but it cracked me up watching my kids try to \"out think\" each other to move the ball to the other person's goal.\n\nAffordable and accessible other than some parking issues.  Highly recommend coming here if you're in the Helena area or even just travelling nearby like us.",
   "A nice stop.  Better for younger kids, under 12.  Could keep kids entertained for an hour or 2.  Pass is good for the day, so you can come back.",
   "Just awesome.  Fun for all ages (adults included!). Always interesting, and so much fun that it's the reward my kids pick after a good week of school.",
   "A wonderful educational experience!!! Great hands on learning! Bring coins for the tornado machine.  Kids love it.  Carousel and ice cream next door.",
   "Nice place for kids who like to play and explore. Not a super \u201cscientific\u201d place but a nice, quiet and fun place for kids to free play. And free wifi for parents ;) We have a pass to a science centre from Alberta and they accept those for admission."

The property is a strong link to the beginnings of a settlement here, offering insights into the lives of miners, the Chinese influence, building techniques of the time, and life of the common men and women who came here seeking their fortune.",
   "It's Sunday so a lot of it's closed but very pretty and is a nice walk up and down the alley. I believe there's a restaurant that you could also eat at. All in all, it's a very nice place to visit and walk around",
   "Quaint corner of the town that seems lost in time.",
   "Fun look into the past.  Enjoyed the buildings and brick street.  Quick stop on the edge of Helena.",
   "Wow, what a beautiful part of the downtown helena area. It's no wonder it's a popular place for portraits. My personal favorite location for a relaxing evening walk."

   "I love this museum. Normally i don't like museums very much, but since the end of last year I've come here almost every week, normally twice a week. It supports teens such as myself very well, and is very all inclusive to all groups",
   "Small but mighty art gallery. Brilliant installation by Catherine Weldon currently, great artwork by women from Peru, live demo of loom work and wool spinning. Lots to see, buy and treasure!",
   "Richard Swanson's \"Red Shift Rocker\" is a public art installation at the Holter Museum of Art in Helena, Montana.  The piece is quite lively and animated and reminds me of a rooster's comb!  The gallery handles work by many diverse and talented artists and has something to fit most everyone's budget.  Definitely worth a visit!"

   "Spring Meadow Lake State Park is the crown jewel among all the local parks. It is close to town, so people who can't go too far afield on their own (kids, for instance) can get there on foot or by bicycle.  \n   The lake itself is also a gem - it is usually clear and it is always deep, cold, spring-fed and full of fish that everybody and anybody can try to catch.\n   Helena is blessed with abundant parks and lots of nearby venues for outdoor fun, but compared to any other urban parks and fishing spots anywhere, Helena's  Spring Meadow Lake State Park cannot be beat."

It is also adjacent to Carroll College and the YMCA, and is connected to Memorial park via a pedestrian underpass, making it a top-notch, comprehensive recreation destination.

Plenty of room, with a bench all along the edge. An island in the middle my kids loved walking around.",
   "Great hot springs and amazing food.\n\nI came to visit my family with my girlfriend and they took us here to show off a little. The hot springs were great, and my girlfriend especially had a lot of fun. But the real treat was the food we had after. I couldn't have expected how amazing the good was. I figured it would be decent, like a kitchen added to the side of a main attraction, but the food was sole of the best I've had in a long time. The reuben sandwich i had was actually probably the best one I have ever had.\n\nGood beer selection as well.",
   "Was crowded but still pretty nice. Will definitely try going again when there aren't so many people. The restaurant was amazing! Great food and prices where affordable.",
   "Nice clean dressing/shower rooms. The old pool needs a little TLC but is nice for laps. I will give it 5 stars when their new pools open...which is a mystery but they look ready. If you are of age try the Bloody Caesar with sake.",
   "Well, first, having multiple pool temps is way cool. You can soak & relax in warmer stuff, you can swim & exercise a little in the lukewarm rec pool, and you can get that body temp up & then cool it down with the hot tub & cold plunge. Secondly, picking from the excellent beer selection & some good pub grub in the well appointed bar is a nice way to go after a healing soak & swim cycle or two. And thirdly, and so hugely appreciated, is the Broadwater allowing cancer patients to soak free for a couple of hours on Thursday afternoons! Thank you so much for that Broadwater!!"

   "A very interesting spot full of history. You could spend the day discovering, picnicking, and checking out the visitor center. The particular day I met my family there, it was VERY HOT and there were dogs involved so we didn't last long in the heat. I would definitely go back when the summer heat has cooled. It was intriguing to see the battlefield, trails walked by soldiers, and the trees were so big and beautiful!",
   "A must visit if you're in the area and are a student of Irish history.",
   "The man who made the Irish Tri-Color flag, fought in our Civil War and became a legislator way out west. A real American hero, and an Irish legend to boot! I am proud to see this here, and hope in the future to help preserve Thomas' history!",
   "Statue of the first governor of the Montana Territory.  Interesting history/: Sounds that like most Irishmen Tommy not only had good leadership skills he had the gift of gab.",

   "A1 experience. Did Philipsburg earlier this week and had fun but this place was way better. You get to see the whole mining process as well as participating on a small scale in your own mining experience digging your own dirt, seiving it as well as picking out stones. The genuine experience. Sapphires n garnets far larger than we found on Philipsburg. Plus owner Bruce was full of history and stories. Well worth the money.",
   "Off the beaten track and lots of sweat equity needed to get your sapphires and absolutely worth it! Beautiful views and good conversation with the boys and other clients.",
   "Our group of nine traveling across the country was looking for something new and exciting to do while near Helena.   Mining for Sapphire sounded like a great opportunity for the kids in the group.  We called the night before for reservations, and woke up early to head to the mine.  Bruce welcomed us and showed everyone the ropes.  Within seconds, the kids were all smiles and enjoyed every second of it.  We had a blast and can not recommend this enough to anyone interested.  Enjoy and dig away...  good luck Bruce!",
   "We had a great time with Bruce, Bob, and Nina! We were shown the ropes for mining with good instruction and patience. Bruce was particularly interactive and we enjoyed listening to his stories and advice. Out family of five had a nice time and came out with some significant stones! Our kids were 10, 13, & 16 for this. A younger boy (6?) with another family needed a hand keeping entertained. My 16 year old enjoyed the final hunt more than the dusty work required to get there.",
   "We didn\u2019t even end up going here, but they put a bad taste in my mouth just from the call. I understand it\u2019s a busy holiday weekend but basic manners still apply. \nMaybe we will give it another chance in the future as they had great reviews, but for now we are going to Spokane Bar Sapphire Mines instead \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Next time, be polite even if you\u2019re full for the weekend."

But even though the entrance looked modest, once we got past the office/shop/store, the place really opened up. The nice lady gave us a great overview of the place, a map with numbers to go by and off we went. Two hours later, we got done! So many hidden curves to explore. And many, many hidden areas with chairs, or a bench, where you can just sit and enjoy the serenity of the gardens. This aspect is so unlike most gardens we\u2019ve gone to. This is really more of an interactive experience. A creek flows right through the gardens, adding to its charm and makes the flowers have sound too. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and takes a lot of time to answer questions. Really worth the entrance fee.",
   "If you like to photograph plants, this is the place to be! A wide variety of sculptures, furniture, and knick-knacks add character to the gardens.",

Not cool in the slick, my-daddy-bought-me-a-camaro-for-my-birthday kind of cool but, like, down to earth and easy - going cool. For instance, once, in the middle of winter, he showed up wearing gym shorts - the cute shorty ones from the 80s (because it was the 80s), cowboy boots, a pink polo shirt with the collar popped, and a straw cowboy hat - like it was a Tuesday. Great Divide is like that. Also, Betsy is particularly great - super helpful and kind. We love it here.",

This place has a small town feel and the staff and regulars will make you feel at home. Like I said I'm from Colorado and have been to places like Vail, Keystone, and Breckenridge, but this place I can see my self coming back to Montana just for this Ski Area and the vibe and all around atmosphere it provides!",

   "The drive in is simple, no traffic at all. Staff were incredibly friendly. I didn\u2019t wait even once in the 2.5 hours I was there to get on a lift. Lifts seem a little outdated, but move fairly quick, much faster than the explorer lift at Big Sky, yet smaller. Seems to have a wide variety of terrain to ride. I\u2019m looking forward to getting into those trees once they get just a bit more snow."

They are knowledgeable and wonderful with children. Their staff is always friendly and are experts in being flexible and creative with children who need different modalities of care. Our daughter has special needs and they are consistently fantastic with her. We are so grateful to have them here in Great Falls.",
   "A great practice and overall experience for me and my 2-year-old daughter. She first saw Ember who was knowledgeable, fun and patient when my daughter was hesitant to get in the dentist chair. Dr. Kevin was warm, a good listener and summarized some key things we can do to keep her mouth and teeth clean. Very pleased with our visit- thank you!",
   "I took all 4 of my children in for a dental check-up at the same time. I was a little nervous about handling all of my kiddos at one time but it turned out to be a wonderful experience. My kids really enjoyed all of the decor and the live fish tanks! Everyone was very understanding of my children and their nerves and helped them feel comfortable. Having moved to Helena from Portland, OR, I left wondering why the big city didn't have any medical or dental office nearly as cool for children.",
   "There was a little mixup with our appointment time but the ladies at the front desk made sure they got us right in!  We met Dr. Richie for the first time and what another GREAT doctor.  The whole staff is just wonderful!  Thank you to you all for making every experience at the office terrific.",
   "Helena is so lucky to have two amazing Pediatric Dentists locally in our community. The front staff are very welcoming and warm. The dental assistants are always professional and really create a WOW experience for every child that enters the dental clinic. I highly recommend Pediatric Dentistry for the whole state of Montana."

The candlelight tours in the winter are amazing for the experience and historic aspects, but the summer tours really show off the caverns with the lights. All of the guides are passionate about their jobs and the caves, and love to teach. Great place to visit and bring friends and family.",
   "This was a great experience. At the time our kids were 5 years old and 8 years old (almost 6 and 9). They did okay getting through the tour but it is a pretty good hike. I don't think I would bring kids any younger then that unless you are prepared to carry them for part of the stroll outside the caves.\n\nIt was hot outside the cave and cool inside so make sure you pack water and a hoodie or warm clothing. Small snack would not hurt either.",
   "A good hike and interesting tour. Long eared bat's seemed to like us. If you are affraid of small tight areas or cannot hike about 2-3 miles you might not be tough enough!  It is an old school hike that is fairly easy downward caverns tour with MT history lesson. Definitely a unique spot that keeps the kids off the phone!",
   "These Caverns are a jewel.   The drive to the caverns winds along the Jefferson River,  with cliffs adorning the sides of the road.   Our party were excited to to the Caverns today, as it was the rare tour through the cave system with candles!!!  This Candlelight tour is offered only at Christmas.   What a treat!!  The vision of the fellow participants weaving among the cave features is idyllic.   It is surprising how much light the candlelight can make in the total dark.   This is a best kept secret.  The tour guides are top notch.",

We went out of our way to go so we didn't have time for the tour of the house but wish we had! The views were amazing as well. The husband and wife team that we met at the visitors center were so nice and super helpful. They volunteer their time to work there! We were both super impressed!!!!",
   "If you are anywhere near this park, do not miss out on the only operational ranch in the National Parks registry. This is one of the best kept secrets of our NP system. The park is a working ranch still. The family that ran and operated this ranch very carefully kept all the records, details and many of the artifacts from the past. There are very few reproductions in the main ranch home and the cowboy housing which is awesome. You get to see how life was for the cowboys back in the 1800s.",
   "Awesome experience and very informative. Park ranger at the entrance taught me and my kids all about bison and how they were used in the 1800s. Tons of stuff to look at, recomend taking the horse drawn carriage around the farm and then enjoying some cowboy coffee made over a fire by a cowboy.",
   "Amazing. I learned a lot about US History. You must visit the main house. Wait for the tour. Most important part of the tour. They are not allowed to take a pic inside of house.\n\nMy private tour guide (Dan Shook) was amazing. He explained everything very clear.",

Between google, signs  and the map the museum provides, you get all the information you could ask for. You can explore inside the prison as well as the prison yard and surrounding buildings. This is a great place to discover some of America's past in regard to the handling and reform of criminals. Overall very interesting place to visit. There is a gift shop and public restrooms. Also attached to the prison by way of the gift shop is an amazing car museum. One stop 2 attractions. The employees are very friendly and helpful. I truly recommend making a stop here if you're in the area.",
   "Loved the experience of being able to go through the old prison. The car museum was just as cool. Great price for a great place.",
   "Great museum! They also have a car museum attached that you can view before it after touring the old prison. It is a self-guided tour, so the ladies at the front desk give you a very informational packet with all the signs listed that you can read aloud to your party as you tour the prison. Nothing spooky happened to use while we toured, but some of our pictures we took do give me the creeps. A fascinating experience for history lovers, and paranormal enthusiasts alike.",
   "This is a great place to visit. Make sure to stop at the store across the street. The People are friendly and the subject matter is fascinating. Just be sure to have enough money to pay to enter, as it is a bit pricey ($10-15). We hope to go back again.",
   "This is an incredible museum in a great little town. If you're out and come across the signs for this museum, stop and check it out. It's well maintained, the staff have great stories and are really friendly. Dropped one star because a good bit of exhibits are \"closed for repairs\"."

I do not like hiking in pants and my legs paid the price on these often overgrown trails but it was worth it. Don't forget your map and compass - one of the trails simply disappeared so you'll want tools to navigate. Water is fairly plentiful, as are butterflies!

   "Excellent experience working with Dillon and Big Sky Brilliance. He was able to make the exact ring I wanted for a price I could not find anywhere else. He did a great job answering any questions or concerns I had and was very responsive. On top of it all, my ring was delivered very quickly. Highly recommend working with him for your next jewelry purchase!",
   "When I almost gave up on my search for the perfect ring for my then fiance (now my wife) Dillion stepped in and helped me so much! I'm a needy customer and I can be difficult. Dillion patiently found the perfect sapphire and ring for my budget. Thank you so much!",
   "If you\u2019re looking for an easy, unique and fun experience while choosing the perfect piece for your loved one, then Dillon with Big Sky Brilliance is your guy! He takes the time to get to know you and your loved one. This allows him the advantage to understand exactly what you\u2019re looking for. We worked together for a few weeks and designed the most beautiful wedding set for my fianc\u00e9 and myself. We are so proud of our rings and so happy that we chose Big Sky Brilliance to design such timeless, momentous pieces. Thank you Dillon!",
   "Dillon-\nThank you for making my experience so great! You were very informative and educated me on jewelry in a way I hadn't expected nor valued until working with you. The approach you took in helping find something so special and unique made the experience comfortable and enjoyable. I highly recommend anyone in search of fine jewelry to give Dillon a shout. He will work within your budget, and exceed your expectations, all while being flexible and eager to satisfy your expectations.  The ring arrived on time and was everything and more I had been hoping for. Thank you again Dillon! I will be recommending and using Big Sky Brilliance in the future!",
   "Dillon was very accommodating In meeting with me. His turnaround and ability to provide example renderings limited meetings to work through and bring our ideas together.  He has a wonderful eye for colors, etc. I enjoyed working with him and would definitely work with him again. LOVE my beautiful ring."

   "This river is amazingly beautiful! You won't be able to take your eyes off the scenery! Our guide was very knowledgeable about the history of various sites along the river. I took one star off because the ticket building and the boat are swarmed with mosquitoes! Between the mosquitoes and the bees on the boat, it was enough to take a little enjoyment from the ride. But overall, the boat tour is an impressive experience!",
   "The place that runs the boat tours does a great job.  The boat drivers are informative about the history and events.  The boat ride is slow-going but enjoyable.  The scenery is amazing, and the price for a 2 hour two seem pretty cheap.  Definitely glad we went.",
   "My husband and I had been before and enjoyed it so much, we took my mother.  Very informational, educational and fun!!  Great for all ages!  The ride is smooth, the guides are awesome, and the scenery is beautiful!  We saw several bald eagles this trip.  We will most definitely be back again.  Next year we want to do the bat tour!",
   "Awesome boar tour. Some construction on road with a pilot car taking cars back n forth so had a good 15 min wait once getting into the park. Give yourself time. They ask you to line up 10 mins prior to your tour time. The office is the brown building to the left once you get to the marina and the do have bathrooms downstairs and on board. \nTour guides were super informative and funny, we saw the gates and lots of Bald eagle, osprey and turkey vultures. They showed us batcaves and told us a lot about the history. Very beautiful and enjoyable. Keep a jacket as it started raining and got cold on the water. \nPsycho insects (nats) were swarming us all, we were all going crazy in line. We thought they were mosquitos but were told they do not bite, they are nats and there are no mosquitos on the marina as the bats eat them all. \nEven thought it was so annoying as they were flying up our noses, they did back off once the boat was in motion and it was nice to know we would not be eaten alive!\nBrian was an awesome tour guide.",
   "Gates of the Mountain is a great little stop. Nice guided boat tour up the Missouri River and back down again. Good scenery and some history learned along the way!"

   "Not many dentists see VA patients but South Hills Dental does and their treatment is greatly appreciated. I drive from Great Falls to Helena to see Dr. Barry and its worth getting up at 5:30 to make it on time. Dr Barry is one of the best dentists I\u2019ve seen in my 52 years. I was married to a dental hygienist for 22 years so I know. Dr Barry and his assistant Nina work great together and very little time is lost getting tools or prepping. Dr Barry knows how to give a shot and make it stick around for a while. Very little to no pain during and after his shots. What makes the difference is that they care about the patient and the work they do for them. I have never been rushed out or pressured to make a decision on work. Everything is explained to me so I know what work is going to be done. The girls up front are friendly and make you feel at ease. If more dental offices were like this one people wouldn't have any anxiety about seeing their dentist. Great Job!!! And be proud of the office you have all made together.",
   "You guys are absolutely fantastic. I have never been to a dentist office that is so caring and so informative and no surprises. Your prices are something that I can afford and today was especially nice. I cannot remember the dentist name but he was so kind and wonderful. The hygienist was very good \n and also very kind. Again thank you for being so professional but yet so compassionate. It was greatly appreciated.",
   "No wait time!  Professional and personable, made sure I was comfortable at all times and that I understood any concerns they had.  I highly recommend!",
   "This office is WONDERFUL!  They did custom mouth guards (athletic guards) for both of my kids.  The hygienist was super friendly and worked extra hard to make sure the insert wasn't uncomfortable for the kids.  Highly recommend these guys!",
   "Simply the best.  Best, most inclusive exam I've ever had. I've never sat in a dentist chair this long, but I've also never really had it this easy. I was assigned the best tech, she cared and was on top of her game, only surpassed by a great dentist, truly a great team.  It was obvious in the beginning that my plan was designed with care, not only for what I needed at the moment,  but what my mouth needed for the future, and I also saw how he passed on his profession.  I remain impressed, and for my first visit I think I'll stick to my first comment, Simply the best!"

   "We had an excellent tour of the Orphan Girl Mine led by Michael.  The World Museum of Mining focuses on the mining in Butte although there are displays that weren\u2019t used in the Orphan Girl Mine.  The displays in the mine are interesting.  They have an eclectic collection of items on the property-some vintage from the era and town and some from other areas.  Much restoration is still needed on the mines and grounds.  Included in the modest price is admission to the doll house/doll displays and rock display from around the world.  Worth a stop if you\u2019re in the area.",
   "Went here for treat street for Halloween and the kids always get ample candy. The wait is long, but definitely worth it.",
   "Just a fantastic experience! We took the 100 foot mine tour and just loved it! We really enjoyed the talk and learned so much about mining, the history of mining and of Butte. We now have such respect for the men who worked those mines and put their life on the line. Highly recommend this tour",
   "This is a neat place with an awesome underground tour. The guide was a born and raised in Butte and very knowledgeable about the history of the mine. The buildings are all from the old town and you can walk into the church buildings, but only get to observe others from outside. I've read some saying this is a waste of time, but it is not. The history is amazing and you also can walk up one of the head frames which is neat. My respect for the miners only grew as I leaned more and more. The history of Butte is tragic and beautiful at the same time. They had electricity before New York and how advanced they were blows my mind.",
   "Unique place to visit! Not entirely wheelchair accessible. A person using a wheelchair will need a significant amount of help. There is a lot to see and read about. Could easily spend a few hours here reading and learning. Would definitely recommend visiting. I would recommend to the staff to find a way to provide better lighting to the individual \"businesses\" on display. Very friendly staff! Would enjoy a guided tour next time!"

A walk through the State Capitol, through the many corridors, and up the staircases is a walk through the History of the Great State of Montana.  I've selected a few photographs of our visit.  If you find my review helpful, please like it. Thank you!",
   "I recommend driving by at night to snap photos. It\u2019s really peaceful and quiet. You can take a picture at the steps out front fairly easy. Great tourist must do.",
   "So much history in this place. You can go on tours with a guide, or on your own. You can make a visit here be as short or long as you want. It just depends on how much you want to learn. During legislative session it is neat to sit in the gallery on the 4th floor for the House or Senate floor session. If you visit between January-April of even numbered years you may have to park a couple blocks away. This is when session is in, and it\u2019s a packed house.",

   "The Montana State Capitol is the state capitol of the U.S. state of Montana that houses the Montana State Legislature which is located in the state capital of Helena at 1301 East Sixth Avenue. The building was constructed between 1896 and 1902 with wing-annexes added between 1909 and 1912. A design competition for the building was conducted in 1896. The commission selected a design by George R. Mann as the winner. In 1897, after it was found that the Commission was planning to scam money from the building project, it was disbanded and a second Capitol Commission was convened. The new Commission abandoned Mann's plan as being too costly, and had a second design competition, won by Charles Emlen Bell and John Hackett Kent, of Bell & Kent of Council Bluffs, Iowa. In order to have their design built, Bell & Kent relocated their office to Helena. While Mann's building was never built in Montana, it was selected later as the basic design for the Arkansas State Capitol. The winning design by Bell & Kent had been altered already during the construction phase, when in 1901 the commission asked for the structure to be made more imposing by increasing the height of the dome. Kent opposed the changes, as his original low spherical dome was meant to be \"pure Greek\", but Bell advocated the commission's request. Between 1909 and 1912, the building was extended by the addition of two new wings on the eastern and western sides. This work was executed by Link & Haire, architects of Butte, with F. M. Andrews & Company of New York as consulting architects."

Wonderful community effort and preserved history:)",

   "This is a really nice state park in Montana. It is where three rivers come together, forming the Missouri River. One especially nice thing about this park, is that all around the headwaters, there are small rocky \"mountains\" that are really fun to climb. If you climb up one, you get splendid views of the river, the trails, roads, and of the surrounding \"mountains\" (hills). It's a great place to hike around, have a picnic, or just enjoy the weather.",
   "There is something magical and sacred about the three major rivers coming together to form  the longest river in North America. There are various short but very interesting trails to hike. If you are a bird watcher its a treasure and a must see. The confluence of the Madison and Jefferson is great enough but then you have the Gallatin river joining the other 2 rivers only 1 mile further downstream. There are restrooms, picnic areas and benches placed around the park. There is even a small cave with a couple of  pictographs in it, that is well marked.",
   "We enjoyed a one-night stay here while heading from Yellowstone to Glacier National Park. It is conveniently located near I-90 and was an easy late-in-the-day drive from West Yellowstone via US Hwy 191. We knew we would be arriving there late on a Saturday, so we made a reservation a few months in advance. We were glad we did, as it was pretty full. The campground has nice, had flat sites, running water and pit toilets, which were as clean as a pit toilet can be in the summer time. Be sure to walk around and check out the informative displays about the history in this location. Very interesting.",
   "We were brought here by our local friends, and totally surprised by this beautiful park.  As the \u201cHead\u201d of the longest river in the US, this park definitely left a clear and long lasting memory for my self, and gave me a good story to tell about the great state of Montana!"

   "I thought this was just going to an art museum but it's so much more!  I love the Russell home with it's character and antiques. I loved the Cabin Studio and imagine watching him paint there or coming to check on him and finding him sleeping on the cot. And the museum with it's variety: Western Art, displays on Western life, so much info on bisons, native American items, saddles, hats and a hearse!  The museum store is also pretty awesome. They have nice gift items.",
   "Wonderful, beautiful and breathtaking paintings by Charles Russell. This is a wonderful museum with much to see along with other artists. This is my third year visiting from Canada and love it every time. Not to miss.\n\nLife is Good! :)",
   "We had a team building experience here for work and got a guided tour.  It was very educational and fun!  I plan to go back on my own in the near future and explore some more.  Definitely give yourself plenty of time, there is a lot to see!  Great for all ages!!",
   "Wonderful place to visit. The exhibits were excellent. The staff was great and helpful. I\u2019d always been an admirer of his works I was so happy to finally visit the museum. \n\nIt was easy to find. Parking was ample and the cost was reasonable. I want to go back again. Take more time.",
   "Great place to visit in Great Falls. The museum was much larger than I expected. Don\u2019t forget to go downstairs and that you can open the drawers!"

There is a very clear natural spring, a playground for the kids, lots of barbecues and picnic areas.

At $49 a day, probably the most reasonable price you'll find in Montana for the chair/runs ratio.

   "We were spending a few nights in Great Falls on our way to Alaska and had to get some parts at a local RV shop.  Fortunately for us, we missed our exit and had to drive to Ulm to do a legal U-Turn.  As we exit the highway I see the sign to First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park. Interesting name so we decided to visit.  So glad we did; the young receptionist was very helpful and after talking with her and two Park Rangers we decided to tour the facility and site.  What a piece of history we knew nothing about.  Fascinating and then taking the drive to the cliffs I couldn't imagine running ahead of a herd of buffalo and at the last minute jumping over the edge to safety.  This park is definitely worth a visit.  Make the time.",

Great scope of local history and relevance as you're guided through the contribution Montana and neighboring states have made to better understanding previous eras. Lots of western history and places for kids to play. Staff was friendly and prices were fair.",
   "This museum is clearly a national treasure, worth of a few hours if you are in the area.  Particularly, we enjoyed both dinosaur fossil collection and the native Americans collection.  The dinosaur fossil collection is very extensive and informative.  Top of the world research on dinosaurs here as we were told.  The museum stuff and volunteers are very helpful and knowledgeable.  As we missed the regular guided tour, we were given a \u201cshort\u201d version of the tour in the dinosaur fossil collection.  Highly recommended!",

Surprisingly, one of my favorite brews here was the Funky Cold Medina, a sour beer! I also enjoyed a pint of their Oatmeal Stout. If you are new, I would suggest trying out a flight and then choosing your favorite in a pint. The employees are helpful, and provide great customer service. My group asked if we could bring in some pizza from a place down the walking mall, and they did not hesitate to say yes.

Well worth the time and entrance fee, especially since allowed to wander at leisure after the tour. Antique items galore on display!",

If you have time before your flight from Bozeman, I recommend you to drop by here. It is 20 minutes to and from the airport. I definitely want to visit again if I have a chance.",
   "Kind of hard to find, it is surrounded by regular businesses and in the same type of building as the businesses.  And it doesn't have a big sign to let you know where it is until you are right outside it's door looking through the window at a 2X2 sign in the window.   That said once you find the place it is a great museum.   They go back to the precursors to computers and electronics all the way to present time.   They have a lot of first items (1st handheld gps, dna sequencer, consumer PC, etc).   The exhibit on the enigma machine is both big and in depth.   The part on womens role in programming was very interesting also  It is a smaller museum but most people would spend an hour or 2 here.  If you are really interested in computers and robotics they have videos playing and you could easily spend double that time looking around.",
   "This place basically has the history of all technology and how it became and developed I don't know how they got it all but they have everything this is a excellent place to go and excellent Learning Place also I was very very pleased not one to go to museums would go back",
   "Fantastic museum. I never thought a computer museum could be so interesting. The history starts incredibly far back, but covers the most important aspects of computer and electronics history. The collection of old computers and electronics is amazing. I can't believe such famous people donated to the museum. There is tons of stuff from Steve Wazniak and tons of other famous people from the computer and electronics world."

This sets the bar for all B&B's! Breakfast this morning was just amazing! Close to an expensive restaurant in a big city. Nick spent time showing us around, and even chatted with us during breakfast. You can see the three of them are so proud of the home, it beams from them at all times. Great location, close to everything, and views are amazing. Thank you, we WILL be back.",

   "I\u2019ve been here twice since I\u2019ve been in town and have not been disappointed. It is very comparable to other big cities\u2019 Italian restaurant. The staff was very attentive. Their pasta dishes have been very good. The portions are fairly large and they do not skim on the meat/proteins. Everything is very well seasoned too. I also really like their dipping sauce and butter for the bread that they bring out. \n\nIm looking forward to coming back every time I\u2019m in town.",
   "Personally I just don't see what people get out of Lucca's.  The few times I have been here it has been over priced for what you get and it takes forever to get your food.  The food is good but not amazing to me.  When it costs $25 for a piece of lasagna I would think it would be amazing.  I guess I'm just not cut out for this dining experience but I know a lot of people do enjoy it.  If you have 2 hours to burn this is the place for you.  The staff is great I can say that.  They were all very nice people and very helpful. It just took too long to get your food and in my opinion it wasn't worth the money or the wait.",
   "The food and wine were perfect! Our waitress was so amazing. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and wait staff that is amazing. Hard to find in Helena. Way to go guys!",
   "Incredible restaurant. Great experience, fun to visit, and awesome food. Dont miss the Tiramisu!",
   "Very nice romantic feel great for date night definitely recommend the mussels!"

   "Great food. We showed up at 5:15 on a Thursday and we were seated right away. No children's menu but they provide rolls right away that entertained my kids. Nice cocktails at a reasonable price. They had a Thai peanut chicken appetizer that was really good.",
   "One of our favorite places for date night. They don\u2019t take reservations, so if you are going on a weekend night, don\u2019t be in a hurry if you want to enjoy the experience. Grab a drink at the bar and have a good time while you wait. Food is fantastic and atmosphere is top notch. They make great drinks and have a good wine list. The creamy Parmesan salad dressing is my favorite dressing of all time.",
   "Do you like to have happy times? Happy times are served here. No matter who you are you're likely to feel right at home here with quality food and genuinely kind people. Check out the wine list, check out the salmon, don't over think it. Did you have a terrible day at work? This place washes the patriarchy away. Give it a try, it's worth it",
   "Our evening at On Broadway was the most perfect dining out experience my husband and I have ever enjoyed. These people are Pros! From our hostess who's name we didn't catch to the bar tender (Adam) and our server (Ellie), the entire experience was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Chefs work from my seat upstairs, very well run kitchen. Superb food,, just the whole package!!",
   "Nice atmosphere. There was a live band playing the night that I was there. The band volume was reasonable, we were able to have conversations without shouting. The restaurant was packed, we got there at 5:30 on a Wednesday and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for five. The menu had a good variety of items. Every one at my table was very satisfied with their dinner. We also split some appetizers (artichoke & variety plate) both were very good. We will return."

This is not a dine in establishment, but the food is made right before your eyes and the taste of homemade Mexican food cannot be beat.",
   "This is a gem in Helena that I recently discovered. I had the carnitas street tacos and they were to die for. I can't wait to try other things on the menu. The only negative I can think of is that there's absolutely no indoor seating and is very crowded inside when ordering during peak lunch time. They do have great outdoor seating if it's nice outside though.",

   "I liked the experience but it wasn't a 5.5 star experience.\nThe food was good but the asiago and garlic had no real flavor. The culture and atmosphere was fantastic. But it feels weird that the kitchen and the windows seem like someone installed the building backwards. With that said, the patio looks cozy and quiet due to its location at the back of the building, albeit a bit dirty.\n\nThe wait staff and people were great, I'd come back for that alone.\n\nFour stars is kinda generous, but 3 stars is way too little.",
   "This was the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had. Definitely coming back.",
   "All I can say is wow! Best dang pizza ever! Not like pizza hut or those nasty name brand places. I was gold mining last year out there on the Discovery Channel and we all fell in love with this place. Kid friendly all the way.",
   "More and more the pizza has burt bits attached or the crust is scorched. I love wood fired pizza and have eaten it from coast to coast. I think more care needs to happen in the oven. I love their thin crust, their sauce, the balance of cheese with all ingredients. They have some of the best specialty pizzas and you can split a pie for variety; you can build your own. The apple walnut salad with choice of dressing is one of the best in town. Staff was polite and attentive this visit. I do wish the would have some seltzers, Pellegrino and fruit seltzers by bottle or can. NO TV is a marvelous feature.",
   "My first time at Bullman's was amazing. This place knows how to do pizza and they do it well. It's a very cozy 11 table building, but the amount of take out orders they did while we were waiting was crazy. I had the Glacier which has pepperoni, Canadian bacon, bacon, jalape\u00f1os, vreen peppers, and pineapple. It was great. I wanted to eat the whole thing but I restrained myself.\n\nOn top of the fantastic pizza, the waitresses were also awesome. Super friendly, made sure our drinks were good, and made sure we didn't burn ourselves on our pizzas when they came out. \n\nWe'll be coming back to Helena just for this pizza again."

   "I got their \"Holy cow chicken fried steak\" dinner and I 110% understand why they call it that. The plate it came on was the size of the hood of my car. The chicken fried steak was HUGE and came with mashed potatoes and corn as well as chicken & dumpling soup (The soup was also absolutely amazing 'just like mom used to make' )  the meal was easily two meals. It was delicious and I'll definitely return. They also had a large selection of pies and desserts which all looked and sounded amazing. I HIGHLY suggest you check this place out. It's also a truck stop so truckers stop on in. It's more than worth it. Quality+quantity. 11/10",
   "Just plain good food! I ordered tomato soup in a bread bowl, which was obviously homemade with chunks of tomatoes and cream, in a crusty sourdough bun. Hubby loved his burger! The strawberry rhubarb pie with huckleberry ice cream was memorably delicious! Service was friendly and efficient. Price was reasonable. Only 4 stars...? Should probably be five... But the noise level was a bit too high for comfort.",
   "What a gem tucked away in this little town. Had the Friday special tuna sandwich and best clam chowder I ever had. Service was fast and friendly. The place was busy and filled with locals. If you are in the area, I recommend you stop in.",
   "Stopped in for coffee and PIE and Shellies did not disappoint!!\ud83d\udcaf The PIE was AMAZING \ud83d\ude0d There was four of us and we all ordered something different (then taste tested them all).

They were BIG \ud83e\udd67slices too\ud83d\ude01 The pies are homemade and they have a huge selection to choose from. I could have taken a piece of each one to go...lol. The coffee was hot fresh and tasty as well!!",
   "Holy Cow!  Seriously, the menu includes the Holy Cow section where portions are as big as yur head and there several pie flavors to choose from...  open 24hrs it's great for earlier mornings and late nights."

Atmosphere is good.\n\nMy second time eating food from here was through delivery. I ordered the lamb chop again and it was cooked super rare. I called and the chef spoke to me and after seeing pictures, agreed to remake my order. Soon after, the owner called me to make sure I was satisfied with how it was handled. \nEven after this mistake, I will definitely come here again based on the customer service!!! The food is amazing too!",

   "Great take out, i would say the hibachi portions seems slightly more generous if your looking for more. The other Japanese dishes we got tasted perfect. Maybe too much onion on the bottom of the teriyaki chicken, in the take home box on the way home it just really baked that onion on the bottom DEEP into the chicken. The dynamite roll was amazing!  Thank you for picking up the phone right away!! First time trying the restaurant, wished it was in person! Will order again!",
   "I always love this type of place. Good show as always. Everything was cooked perfectly. The dressing on the salad was unique flavor compared to other places. Good veggies. We tried a couple of sushi as well. I loved the veggie one.",
   "It\u2019s a decent spot for Japanese food. It\u2019s quite expensive for an average quality of food, even though they advertised it as \u201cfinest and freshest ingredients\u201d, this is plainly not true because the fish were frozen (still tasted frozen in sashimi and nigiris), knowing that\u2019s it\u2019s impossible to get fresh fish such as tuna or oysters around here. A platter of oysters were $10 for four tiny pieces. We also got a chicken teriyaki that came out over cooked and dried, which was very disappointing. Despite this, I understand that it\u2019s not easy to get fresh ingredients here so I still enjoyed my time at Nagoya because I acknowledged that there\u2019s not many Asian restaurants around here. The servers were super friendly and accommodating, but I think the hostess needs to check her attitude because we did not feel welcomed when we entered the restaurant. She didn\u2019t even look at us and immediately said \u201cfollow me\u201d without \u201cplease or thank you\u201d... and no smiles! Of course I didn\u2019t come here for service, but it would be nice to have a good atmosphere for the dining experience.",
   "The best thing about this restaurant is the side where the chefs provide a stunning show as they prepare our meals on a huge grill in front of us.  Highly skilled chefs.  Food was wonderful.   I found the other side of the restaurant's atmosphere where the tables and booths are less spectacular.",
   "This place is always consistent. The food has so many wonderful flavors! Service is always impressive and attentive. The hibachi grill is a great experience for any age. So unique since we have nothing else like it in Helena."

If you're going to split a four course meal and you've got an appetite, of recommend splitting a four course meal and tacking another salad on the side.",
   "Magnificent food,  wonderful cocktails,  professional staff beautiful environment, lovely murals on all the walls,  gentle music.  It would be a fantastic place to bring a very special date,  celebrate an anniversary or treat yourself to high quality 5 star cuisine.  You get a traditional Italian 4 course meal starting at $50 or can pick and choose your  meal selections instead. For all that you get i firmly recommend the 4 course, we found  it's more value for dollar. I also highly recommend the cocktails, they were absolutely perfect.  I did not try the large wine selection yet but i plan to,  the menu also gives food pairing with wine suggestions,  i found that to be helpful if you aren't as familiar with wine like myself.",
   "Delicious, authentic, lots of food! Honestly exceeded my expectations. The waiter was very friendly, prompt, and helpful recommendations.",
   "The place is way overpriced and not accommodating at all. My fianc\u00e9 loves authentic Italian but I\u2019m more of a simple chicken and pasta type. We went in thinking they would have a bit of a variety, or at least an option for those who don\u2019t like eggs in their spaghetti, but no. Don\u2019t go unless you\u2019re both huge fans of overpriced \u201cauthentic\u201d Italian. We ended up leaving right after sitting down.",
   "We enjoyed a delicious four course meal here and loved every bite. The desserts were amazing. The espresso was fabulous. That's a big deal in my book-lots of bad espresso out there. \n\nThey recently enhanced the interior, which is a lovely change from the austere atmosphere of past iterations.\n\nThe chef clearly knows food and has a gift for interesting combinations. Helena needed this. And I love it that you can sit outside on a patio away from car traffic. \n\nGoing back immediately."

I had the fish and chips which were delicious.. and even better when I spotted the malt vinegar. My lovely bride had the philly burger special and said it too, was delicious. The Windbag remains on the list of top local, (non chain or franchise) eateries.",

Pictured is the pretzel, but the wings were great too. I also love that they have a different special for each day of the week. It is located on a neat car free, walking area in downtown Helena!",
   "We were able to seat ourselves rather quickly. Our waitress arrived with menus and took our drink order. Drinks arrived and placed out order. My salad arrived ask the gal that brought the salad for silverware; my wife asked her if they had sweet and low. She did not know but would ask. She never came back. Finally our waitress showed up. Got silverware, sweet and low. Food arrived from same gal as previous. Ask her if our daughter could get a refill. She said yes, but never returned. Waitress arrived and got refill. \n\nRecommendation is to have support staff take ownership or work with wait staff to address customer issues or assistance.\n\nBesides that the food was great. I had the Mac n cheese burger, my wife had the BLT and my daughter had the original Mac and cheese. She said it was very good. My burger was still hot after I ate my salad. I thought I may have waited too long. We also ordered the funnel fries. Nice sweet and tasty desert.",

We loved that there were so many choices. They also had a great kids menu. We love the ambiance of the restuarant & their prices are worth the amount of amazing food you get. They also have a wide variety of specialty drinks & handcrafted beers. Definitely a must if you are in Helena, MT",

Then during happy hour I was informed all pints of draft beer are only $2.50...unheard of. Nick the bartender was very kind and provided excellent service. Would recommend this place to anyone!

Every item is house made and always blows away my expectations. I applaud Eric, Hillary, Nash, and Zack for making every visit better than the last!",
   "Benny's is the best. Simply put. I've been visiting this establishment since I was young girl. Memories of family gatherings, celebrations, birthdays; etc are all held within those walls..Beside the nostalgia, the service, food, and atmosphere is amazing. Love it here. Love the owners, love it all. \ud83d\udc93 \n\nPS. Best tomato soup in town!",
   "Had lunch there with my mom yesterday. I had the Thai Curry chicken which was good and she had the Montana Rancher sandwich. The sandwich was cold. And not just cold as in a cold cut sandwich, but as if it was pulled out of a cooler and mildly thawed. The bread was nearly frozen, tomatoes and lettuce were frozen and all of that was covered in a lot of mayonnaise. It should not have come out of the kitchen at all. Really disappointed that they served something like that. Doesn\u2019t seem that they take any pride in their meals.\nI\u2019ve always had this issue with Benny\u2019s- they\u2019re never consistent with the quality of food they serve. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been there and I had hoped that changed but clearly it did not.",
   "Always a wonderful experience here at Benny's!\nAlthough, one time they ran out of the Walleye special really early one evening, it still has some of the best & freshest food around.\nGreat, friendly servers and cool, lite live music adds to the ambiance. \nA must if visiting Helena!",
   "Had the Creole \"Brick\" Chicken. It was very good. Could have been a little more spicier since it was advertised as having \"creole seasoning\". Enjoyed the Chocolate Ganache Tart for dessert. Very nice atmosphere. Lovely local place. Will be back for sure!"

   "Can anyone say enough great things about this absolutely wonderful restaurant! The menu goes on and on or create your own . So many homemade items you'll be amazed ! Everyone of the staff is always cheerful and they make your experience worth going over and over again ! Don't miss out on stopping at either of their two locations !",
   "OMG THIS PLACE WAS GREAT! I had the pleasure of indulging the taco omelet. The staff was good, the service was....they offered me a cup of coffee while waiting to be seated. Grade A on customer service for that alone. Add that to fact that the waitress was on point,  I'll  be back",
   "Excellent food. We had two littles with us so they put us off to the side. They put a paper under the high chair to make cleaning the floor esaier, which was a great idea. All of us enjoyed the food. Can't wait to come back. They had a infant seat in the bathroom which is great.",
   "I was looking for a local Helena restaurant for breakfast before leaving Montana and happened upon Steve's Cafe. I tried the shrimp omelette with hash browns and berry pancakes. It was a large serving, so i couldn't finish everything. I was not disappointed. Food was delicious. Service was good, staff were friendly, and prices not too high. Great coffee! I really enjoyed the authentic diner ambiance. I would definitely stop again for a good breakfast and try something else. I recommend eating here for breakfast.",
   "Homemade corned beef hash was amazing. Super clean inside, and easy to find the restaurant too. The service was great, all the staff was super polite, super attentive, and very prompt. The food came moments after ordering, really fast service. Everything was cooked perfect, but the ham in my wife's omelette needed to be cut into smaller pieces. That was our only complaint and I'd hate to call it a complaint because our experience was wonderful and we'll always eat breakfast here anytime we're in Helena."

Great job!",
   "Love this place! The food is good can\u2019t really go wrong with anything. I recommend the Melaque Burrito and the tamales. The only negative is that it\u2019s pretty small and can wait for a table for a while sometimes.",
   "Great service and consistent quality! There are very few places in Helena and Montana for good or close to authentic Mexican cuisine, this place is not too bad. Some of the traditional dishes have been adjusted because locals don't necessarily like some dishes, so it has been altered to fit the local tastes which is primarily Caucasian.",
   "Instead of simmering sauce to proper consistency. They do not season and add corn starch.  Despicable.  Never again.  called to confirm the cornstarch. Yep. No effort. Lazy cooks.  Save yourself."

My husband is a fan of the lettuce wraps. My daughter loves the calamari.  And the desserts!  The bread pudding is a must and the Tuxedo cake is my favorite.",

   "We ate dinner in the lounge at happy hour on a monday. We were able to order off the happy hour menu, lounge menu and main dinner menu. We got the steak tips and raviolis off the happy hour menu. They had run out of the potatoes. The steak tips were very salty but the ravioli was great. Also tried onion rings that were really good. I had the steak and lovely mashed potatoes. My husband has the bison burger which was huge. The special happy hour cocktail was a cranberry apple that I enjoyed. Service was really good. Did slow down a bit at the end when they started getting busy.",
   "We just sat at one of the tables in the bar and ordered from the menu there. The food and drinks are great and I was able to order exactly what I wanted. My waitress was extremely professional, kind and friendly. Ther kind you don't get much anymore. I had a good time.",
   "Understated Montana elegance with a superb menu. Seafood, steaks, pasta, and great cocktails; Silver Star is a destination spot to relax and enjoy a delightful dinner with friends. One of Helena's finest establishments, but come casual and fit right in."

   "Want honest to goodness good smoky barbecue? THIS is the place you're looking for! Though the orders can sometimes be slow coming out of the kitchen, the food is worth the wait. This is among my Top 5 Cue Joints in the U.S. Repeat trips are authorized and encouraged.",
   "Just plain good eatin. You can't mess up slow cooked meat and when presented in a laid back, inviting environment what's not to love? The only problem is their business hours. I almost never get to enjoy this establishment because they're always closed when I try. \ud83e\udd7a",
   "Third time visiting Bad Betty's. Pretty tasty barbeque but it's the slaw and tater salad I really enjoy. Only have two wishes... First, two to three types of BBQ sauce would be awesome. Their sauce is good, but looking for more of a sweet BBQ style (picky what can I say). The second would be tater tots. Being gluten free I can't do their sandwiches but putting BBQ on tots with slaw is an awesome alternative and a great side! \n\nHowever, good overall! A place that I recommend to eat at when in Helena.",
   "Awesome BBQ, as usual. This place never disappoints. Good food. Good service. Usually get a seat in 5 min or less. Down to earth good food. I'll be back."

Last night we order 2 sandwiches with a wait time of 30 minutes. There is only one sandwich ready when we come to pick the order up. It has been done awhile as it was soggy and cold by the time we got home. The second sandwich was bbq that wad so watery that the bread was mush. You couldn't even eat the sandwich it was that wet. Neither sandwich was eaten and to top it off, it was no big deal to the staff that the order was not complete in 30 minutes for 2 lousy sandwiches. We wont be back.",

Steaks were cooked just right, condiments were asked about, and refills were given appropriately. They were nice enough to be ok with the wedding cake we brought in beings that they have many desserts but no cake. Had they had it we would have gotten it from them. They were awesome enough to bring out a pie/cake server along with plates and new forks and napkins. Thank you Perkins! You were awesome!!",

For the opening day the service was fantastic, the food was delicious and the prices are extremely good value! I would recommend this to any local foodie! \n\nThey custom order pizza, they deliver, and always have fresh pizza and chicken available!",
   "On 2/12/2020 we stopped in for lunch. Normally the ranch is great. This time the chicken was over cooked and the breast dry. I asked the attendant if they had other breasts. He stated they had just put out fresh chicken which was false. He did say he would check and never came back. Not only was the skin toasted dark brown there was to much oil under it. The salad bar had mushy spinach in it.  This was the first time I had been disappointed. Still quality control is necessary for customers to have a good meal.",
   "Best fried chicken in Helena. Some of the food is better than most restaurants in Helena, but you'll get plenty of of it. Nice staff. If your hungry, this place is for you. I think PR is three steps above fast food.",
   "This establishment is convenient and fun for both adults and children. The large TV screens with video make it so that adults can continue to enjoy their meals while keeping an eye on their playing children in the arcade. They also have large rooms setup that can be reserved for bday parties. They have excellent pizza, and even offer chicken, mashed potatoes, a well stocked salad bar with many options for topping, soup, ice cream machine, and desserts. Affordable, all you can eat, and custom made pizzas to order. My only complaint is I have been here multiple times where they have run low on food items or the bar has been out and refill has been slow, especially on the dessert bar. Staff is always friendly and helpful."

The 2 times I took it home & it would have been a pain taking it back to the restaurant. This last wrong order was nothing like what I ordered, it actually was the worst burrito I've ever had. I would probably only go back for chips and salsa. Their hot salsa is really good. Their beer selection is also really good.",

But the waiter, and his fedora, were overwhelmed by 5pm on a Friday.",

   "I haven't been to this place since they opened. We decided to try them again since we forgot about the place. The food is really delicious and clean. The staff are very friendly and always made sure we had enough water/beer throughput our experience here. \n\nI would have given them 5 stars but because my wife and I got our orders at different times and our appetizer came after we were done eating. We also had to wait 15+ minutes to get our bill. The restaurant wasn't very busy either. Ultimately, the food is absolutely delicious and inexpensive! I would recommend if you give them a few more minutes. Wish I had photos of the food but I ate them too fast!",
   "Great meal. We did the all you can eat sushi dinner for $30 each person. It includes all the sushi and most of the appetizers and a few other items like noodles. We had two toddlers with us that ate for free. Changing table in the restroom.",
   "Good sushi - for Montana. It isn\u2019t a coastal sushi joint but definitely one of the better places you will find in the treasure state. Nice environment and VERY friendly staff.",
   "Such good food, and great hospitality. Girl there remembers us every time and is the sweetest lady. Such a fun environment. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Helena.",
   "In my honest opinion,  best sushi around. My wife and I drove down from the Hi-Line to eat here. The Suki's in Great Falls is temporarily closed until they find a new location. We are eagerly awaiting for them to find location and open. Our #1 place to eat."

   "Great service, huge portions, and great food. The Marion Berry pancakes tasted great, and the jam that came with it was amazing on some toast.\n\nI can eat a lot, but I couldn't finish my food. Two moderate eaters may be able to split the Chicken Fried Steak meal.\n\nCoffee could have been better; I expect a place called a cafe to have decent coffee but it's the same meager stuff you get at any breakfast place.",
   "Amazing stuffed huckleberry French toast! Awesome sausage and eggs were perfect! Make a stop you will enjoy it.",
   "Helena, Montana.\nWhen I was messing around in Helena, I asked the four locals that were available \"What is the best breakfast place in this town?\"\n\nAll four men replied with Steve's Cafe.\n\nIt was a no-brainer to head to cafe de esteban to be nourished for the following day's massive activities.\n\nThe host, waiter, and staff were awesome. Montana's hospitality is second to no other state (unlike Nebraska at rank 48 and that's cause I haven't been to two states yet).\n\nI did not try coffee here (had my own french press with the hotel).\nHowever, the ice cold water was refreshing.\n\nFood is standard diner food. It wasn't as OG as Waffle Plus in Spokane (sorry to compare) however beats the heck out of 90% Cali diner food.\n\nVeggie ommie - decent sized. It has olives so make sure to omit.\nThe avocados not too shabby.\n\nPancakes - Smaller than anticipated. Had nice thickness and not too dry. Tasted more commercialized (pre-made pancake batter) than a house recipe.\n\nFrenchie Toast - Standard size. Yummy. This was bomb with the crisp strawberries on top. The s-berry mix was sweet enough that it didn't need syrup. Plus the powdered sugar made it sweet too.\n\nHash Browns - Commercialized. Came from a bag. Ya can taste it. They do give a good amount.\n\nOverall I loved the place. Can't compare it to any other local flare.\n\nPricing - Appx $10 per head which is expensive for Montana. But that's what happens when you win a bunch of awards.\n@cigarcpa",

   "The server was very nice. But the food was expensive, the seafood in the seafood dishes we ordered wasn't visible, and there were things (more than 1) floating in my water. But the absolute worst part was when I went to use the restroom, it was beyond FILTHY! Smelled horrible, and the feminine hygiene disposal was OVERFLOWING (a large part of the gag inducing smell, I'm sure)! When I told the woman  at the hostess station, who was one of the owners according to my server, she got really rude with me;almost confrontational. As if I alone was responsible for the bathrooms being in such a state. I told her she ought to be ashamed, and if the front of the house looks like that, I'd hate to see what their kitchen looks like. We'll never go back. \n\nWe'll spend out money at The Chinese Kitchen on Euclid. Where there actually shrimp in the shrimp fried rice, and customers are treated like humans.",
   "This restaurant definitely is the rich, deeply flavored version of Chinese food. The egg flower soul is one of my favorite soup of all time. The almond butter chicken sauce is guilty pleasure to the max. The Canton noodles have wonderful flavor but I don't love the quality of chicken they use in the dish. This is one of my favorite Helena restaurants and I love visiting it when we are in town!",
   "A nice Chinese restaurant in Helena. Is quality Chinese food with large portions and very reasonably priced. This place has a knowledgeable and friendly staff. Great place to get lunch or dinner and has room for a decent group of people.",
   "The best Chinese restaurant in the region! We ordered Kung Pao Tofu, with steamed tofu (rather than fried), and Sesame Tofu. Food was served quickly and it was fresh and delicious, with large, family style portions. We left with a full second meal each! The menu offers a great variety, including beer and wine--a good wine list, even though the server did not quite know how to serve it. Our server was efficient and pleasant. The atmosphere is upscale and neat as a pin. Wish there was a Jade Garden in my town!",
   "I really enjoy Jade Garden. It's kind of expensive but worth the extra money on a special occasion. However, we placed a to go order & it was an hour late & we didn't get the whole order. I'm really disappointed. Probably won't go there again."

   "The service and the food were really good!! I got the Hashbrown Waffle and it was absolutely delicious!",
   "Overhyped. My palette was all set based on people raving about this place. The food was good but unfortunately it was underwhelming. This is not intended to bash this establishment by any means. The ambiance and atmosphere was great. The food descriptions were a little short so it was hard to be wowed by the choices before tasting. The apple sauce had the apple skins in them :) kudos for that!",
   "I was rather disappointed. Food in the display case all looked really good, the flavors of the quiches sounded tasty. I was rather excited to try the quiche, my husband ordered a hash brown waffle. My quiche was put in the microwave before my husband had ordered and his waffle took a standard of 13 minutes to cook. Not only was my quiche(obviously) unevenly heated but the crust texture was gummy and not entirely appealing. I think it would have been much better to be reheated at a low temp in a small toaster oven, especially since my food was ready long before my husbands.",

You won't find food like this anywhere else in Montana. I've never been to Japan, so I can't speak to its authenticity, only its quality, which is excellent. I've enjoyed every dish I've tried here, and will definitely be back often. And hats off to the staff, who are always friendly and helpful, and wear the coolest t-shirts!",

They are quick to fix mistakes and apologize, many times they have gone above and beyond to ensure satisfaction. I have been here many times and have not had one thing on the menu that I have not liked or enjoyed. If I could give more stars I would! Love this restaurant!",
   "A unique restaurant in the capital of MT. Great Asian foods and drinks. The Ramen is their specialtie that will surprise you. It is well prepared with various flavors of your choosing. If don't like Ramen and want to try something new they have a  great menu that will please everyone in your group. The restaurant is beautifully designed to enhance your experience. A grear place to go with a bunch of friends."

   "Can\u2019t beat this place. Such a great Montana feel. Of course their chicken is great, but the burgers are the best in Helena. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get. Sometimes there can be a wait if you have a party of more than 2, but it\u2019s rarely longer than 15-20 mins. Well worth the wait.",

   "I finally went here! Heard about it for years now and have been seeing their food posts on Facebook! They lived up to everything I have been told and have seen. Service was great, drinks were cold, and food was top notch. My only complaint would be, it was uncomfortably hot inside there. However, the open pit fire was neat! I enjoyed the stained glass up and around the ceiling.",

Being gluten intolerant I have missed having spicy chicken sandwiches, and the Smokejumper Station has the PERFECT gluten free spicy crispy chicken sandwich!

   "They would not honor the discount from MTN Deals an ad they did on TV, very sad.  The wait was long to get our food, and they were not sorry, just gave us food and left.  Overpriced for bland tasting food and meh service. I guess if your waiting for a plane you are trapped and have no choice.  Homeless shelter would have better food and service.",
   "Amazing place to drink a beer and eat some great food!",
   "Mediocrity at it's best.  Sunday is buffet only and it costs a whopping $15.20 which is slightly above average for most buffets.  When you factor in dirty plates, buffet items running out twice within 15 minutes with not a packed house; I'm left with the impression that I'm not getting top service for the top dollar they demand here.  Chicken enchiladas tasted decent with good flavors but looked unrecognizable.  The Mac and cheese was a grease pit with blandness flavors.  The bacon was great and the mini pancakes were decent.  Amazingly there were no eggs available in the is breakfast and lunch buffet.  Interesting enough, they had a massive table blocking the fire exit.  I expected a slightly elevated service and dining experience here, unfortunately I left unimpressed leaving with a price tag that doesn't reflect what I received in exchange."

   "Terrible service. Terrible food. Went there with my wife last night-just 2 of us. Restaurant was only about half full which means about six tables full. Had to wait 15 minutes for drinks and waitress brought wrong drinks. Then had to wait an hour and 20 minutes for our meals and one of two was not what we ordered. Didn't have another hour and a half to wait for the correct meal so tried to choke down part of what was served. Waitress didn't apologize or discount meal.   Don't go there if you want decent Mexican food served in a timely manner.",
   "Terrible service. Took 5 minutes for waitress to acknowledge me at door waiting to be seated. Order was received wrong. Only time waitress interacted with me was to throw (literally threw) the check on the table.",
   "First and foremost, the food is delicious. The atmosphere is great with the music playing in the background. The staff was very friendly and did very well about checking up on everyone. A great experience all around.",
   "The service was so poor and lacking it was ridiculous.  The waitstaff have no understanding of the concept of teamwork, service was slow, the server forgot to pick up our order and deliver it to the table, and the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full.  When I went to pay the bill, our server asked who our server was... seriously?  There were only 4 tables with people and their were 2 servers.  Servers were not very friendly or attentive.  For a place that advertises on television so much, you would expect that once they get customers in, the service would be decent at least (or perhaps that is why they need to advertise so much - because once people go there, they don't return?.  If you are even considering this restaurant, try Melaque instead.",

   "Good food. Kids loved the peanut butter and jelly. Very large place. Lots of high chairs and tables. Very orginal sandwich in a roll.",
   "Sandwiches and atmosphere were awesome! Service was not. No one in line and it took almost 15 minutes to make our 3 sandwiches."

Personally not a big fan of their red sauce they put on their enchiladas and the rice is not great to say the least. The restaurant is really tiny. I could see it possibly as a good date spot.",

We just went through the drive through and ordered lunch... the burger was ice cold like they were using previously grilled meat that had been refrigerated and the fries were hard as rocks. They were more like chips. We won't be back. We contemplated calling but didn't want to fight with anyone. There was no one else in the place so not sure why they can't just do a decent job. What a waste of 15 dollars as the food went on the garbage.",

   "Los Caz is always great food.  The portions are generous and the quality is awesome. The wait staff is very helpful and keeps things moving.  Their signature burritos are to die for.  Better bring a big appetite though as they are not for the faint if heart.  They are always consistent on quality and I have never left here hungry.  The home made salsa is amazing as well.  If you are in the area at lunch time this is a must try place.  Make sure to check their days though as sometimes they are closed.  Keep up the good work and great food guys.",
