   "Clean, green and very well maintained. Italian garden, Japanese garden, Nature center and wild life experience makes the visit here filled with fun for all age groups. Mansion is great. Kids would love exploring nature up and close here. Not sure if there is a bicycle path here.",
   "One of the best free attractions in Richmond. Great place for a picnic or to walk around and see the Japanese garden. I love feeding the goats and sheep (remember to bring quarters). We had our daughters 1 year birthday party in the Stone Barn and it was awesome, they had horse and carriage rides for the kids. One of our go-to stops if the weather is nice.",
   "The gardens are well maintained and the animals are taken care of too. Bring the family or someone special to enjoy this Richmond jewel. Be mindful, not all trails are paved so you're going to have trouble if your wheels/feet aren't off road and you want explore the grounds fully.",
   "Lots of space to run around, beautiful gardens and historic house, and of course lots of animals to see. They have a whole petting zoo farm area AND a zoo area with local wildlife. They have eastern bison, a black bear, deer, and birds. Great place to take kids or go for a nice walk. I definitely haven't seen the whole place its full of secret areas.",
   "We love Maymont! While it's not a traditional zoo, my son gets such a kick out of the animals. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours. Such a fun mixture of zoology, botany, and history. A great Richmond fixture for the whole family. Bring some quarters if your little ones like to feed animals!"

Last month we came for the Edward Hopper exhibit, and this past weekend we came to see the existing museums exhibits (I really liked the American Art gallery, really beautiful ) and there was China Fest, for the Chinese lunar new year! Beautiful presentations by community dance and martial arts groups, programs for children as well ! Lots of kids! So much fun!",
   "I love this place. I do find it a bit confusing to walk through, but there are many docents available to help. I bought tickets for the Edward Hopper exhibit yesterday and the woman at Visitor Services was so kind & helpful - set the tone for a wonderful visit!\n\nThere are many clean restrooms and a beautiful museum store. The entire place is so calming and makes for a great any day activity- alone or with a group.",
   "Wonderful museum with beautifully curated exhibits covering a wide range of fine arts. The recent Hopper show was spectacularly presented. The museum staff here is the most knowledgeable, welcoming and helpful I have ever encountered. And let's not forget Amuse, the VMFA's world-class restaurant -- wonderful cuisine, cocktails, and wine list, plus awesome servers and staff.",
   "Excellent Location. Cool and different artwork that caught my eye in all sorts of mediums. If you love art I spent 4 hours here and didn't even go over the additional exhibit they had at the time. Clean and relaxing as well.",
   "What a great collection in a wonderful building. They really have one of everything here. This special exhibition space was generously proportioned so you had plenty of room to see all the art."

   "We took the kids here and this is by far the best science center I have ever been too. The kids had so much fun playing around and learning. I would have to say one of my favorite parts were playing air hockey with a robot, probably the nearest thing I've ever done. I would love yo go back. They do offer military discount, free for the active duty member and a dollar off for their dependents. We really enjoyed our day here and would love to go back. We traveled 2 hours to get here and it was well worth the trip.",
   "Very nice place for kids in the 5-12 year range. After the spectacular entrance, we could see the magical SR71 stealth aircraft. Very good decision by the museum folks to move it inside. They have live animal exhibits, which is cool. There are folks who could answer any questions you might have, which is very good. Kids loved the science challenges. There are nice exhibits about current day problems such as plastic, pollution, etc which are so relevant and useful for everyone to know.",
   "Wonderful science museum with a great, ever-changing collection of exhibits and hands-on activities. We especially loved the live dissection of a cow's eye! The only challenge of visiting the museum is the limited parking, though there are lots on the side off Broad and you can park in front of the children's museum next door. Definitely worth a visit or membership, especially if you have children!",
   "An extremely fun and informative museum for individuals of all ages. The exhibits here are time-honored and exciting. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly, especially with children. If you're looking for a fun place to take the kids on a Saturday afternoon, this is the place.",
   "Great museum with lots of hands on activities to keep children engaged. The special event space is large and they always have great exhibits in there as well. I also appreciated the live cooking events that they do. I will say that their Cafe is pretty lackluster. It is all microwave food and premade sandwiches. For the price and the number of people (four) they had working behind the 10ft long counter they could have actually prepared some food. Overall, though a great way to spend a day."

The view from upstairs overlooking the dinning area can be breathtaking if decorated right. We had the opportunity to do two event here. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. The museum itself is very clean. The caterer need warming towers as there is no kitchen and a limited food prep area",
   "My husband and I spent two hours at the museum but didn't finish so we had to return the next day. It is pretty incredible. We were surprised by the detailed information and authenticity of the materials that were displayed, as well as the connection to those who survived the the holocaust then relocated to Richland. This free museum is a treasure.",

   "I love that there are different buildings to self navigate through. Very cool sit down library with local raven art on the walls. Cute resident cats, nice staff, and lots of interesting things about Edgar A. Poe to learn here.",
   "If you love history and poetry. Especially American Poetry written by Edgar Allen Poe this is the place for you....it's a quaint building but has a very eclectic collection of Poe relics, art, and history. Awesome place. Very cool spot. A must see.",
   "Nice little stop for horror and mystery enthusiasts. There is a garden, small library, gift shop and museum on the property. It's not really a spooky thing, more educational. Die hard fans can leave a note or poem for Edgar. There is a shrine. But mostly it's a collection of historical items that have been saved from his houses or work before the buildings were destroyed.",
   "Poetic. I have been a fan of Edgar Allan Poe since I was a little boy. I came to Richmond unaware of the museum here in his honor. What a treat!! First, folks, this is a right-sized museum. Not too big and not too small. Prices are very affordable and getting here from our downtown hotel was an easy but slightly long walk. Too many cool details to describe, but having a black cat strolling through the garden could only have been topped by a raven."

The statues of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington are cool and the architecture (designed by Jefferson) is beautiful. There's also a nice park with statues outside to walk around in.",

   "The actual tour of the Capitol is interesting in itself, but our docent could have been teaching a history class. So much knowledge! The majority of the time is spent in a few chambers so there is not a lot of walking. The information imparted there was of utmost interest and importance. Of course there is s gift shop which contains a variety of treasures. Our first stop in Richmond definitely encouraged us to explore more."

When the tour is done you will have the rest of your time to yourselves in the garden and grounds.  Well worth the trip.",

Stunning composure and presentation of materials with breathtaking audiovisual supplements makes for a singular experience that cannot be overlooked by any history buff. The expose on early American currency was particularly informative, including a wide selection of bills, both government and private bank notes. External exhibits were equally intriguing with the explanation of the workings of a civil war era iron mill. Outstanding in all aspects.",
   "Really nice museum! Very informative! It is a little pricey and smaller than I thought but they do squeeze in a lot of information. Parking is validated with a ticket which is really nice. I brought my 5&9 year old honestly it was too much reading for them. They liked to look at the pictures and exhibits however went through the whole thing within minutes. My 5 year old was very bored.",
   "Museum is well set up and has interactive electronic screens for each year of the war. There are also a few short videos that you can sit and watch throughout the exhibits. It is very visitor friendly and breaks the information up into digestible pieces. Highly recommend!",
   "Excellent museum that I think expertly handles the intricacies of the Civil War. I learned a lot. Beautiful interior of the museum. Many multimedia presentations. Pretty cool. Probably ages 10 and up. But the 10yr old would have to be pretty interested in history.",
   "Political Correctness run amok!\n\nI'm not sure why the old Museum of the Confederacy was closed or why it merged into the Civil War Center to become what it is now, but it was a major disappointment.\n\nThe exhibits are well done and the facility is a wonderful effort of conservation and city redevelopment, however, they fail to pursue numerous area of this controversial area.  While they do deal with anti-war riots in New York and similar themes of the Confederacy, a lot was left out.  Now this isn't because the place is overfilled with material.  Nope...I'm estimating that only about 25% of the available floor space is occupied with exhibits.  The entry areas are massive and a waste of space.\n\nFinally, in the gift shop, there are plenty of replicas of historic Union flags, as there should be, but no Confederate battle flags.  That says it all.\n\nDon't waste your time here."

FYI: If you do get caught, you can be arrested and face huge fines.",

When I went last, the Miller and Rhoads clock was proudly displayed above the stair well that descended to the basement-like floor; that was something very special to see since my grandparents loved the store. I was also given a tour where our group was allowed to hold old, historically-important books, such as ones belonging to/read by Patrick Henry. That was very fun; I am an avid reader and love history. The museum has a creative mindset with their exhibits, there was not just one area of focus in history, the range was lovely. I reccomend this museum to be visited by adults or older children, the younger ones might not be interested in what they have to offer.",

   "Paid a visit to the Capital to see the new Virginian women's monument - Voices From the Garden.  Though still in progress, the 7 out of 12 planned statues are very expertly crafted and worth the trip to see.  Surprisingly diminutive in size, the statues are realistically crafted and pleasantly life size. The memorial lacks information and context at this time.  There are no plaques nor hint of who the women are on display. So it's necessary to Google and learn who the figures are and who's to come. Not really a problem. All the more reason to pause and enjoy.",
   "An amazing building and place full of history and history being made. Take a tour and explore were the oldest continuous legislative body sits in session and the awe inspiring architecture of Thomas Jefferson. The tour guides are terrific and take you through the unique history of Virginia and it's legislative body.",
   "So much incredible history in and around this building. Touring the capitol and walking in the same chambers that Thomas Jefferson and George Washington did was surreal. Free hourly tours and such kind hospitality from the guides.",
   "We took the free tour of the Capitol on a Sunday when we had friends in town visiting. The tour provides a good mix of information about the architecture and history of the Capitol building - beginning with Thomas Jefferson's role in its creation. Also, how the construction of Virginia's Capitol building influenced subsequent design choices in Washington,  D.C. and government buildings throughout the country.  The tour includes entry to the house chambers. We really enjoyed the tour and the expertise of our guide.",
   "Historic building, lots of shade outside for those hot days, fountain, brick walkways, and underneath it all the visitor's entrance (with a delightfully air-conditioned inside)."

   "I feel a little torn, I enjoyed the museum but I expect there to be more.  A good exhibit on the lasting, personal impact of slavery and a walk through of Virginia's history we're the only things to see. They were both done well, but I was looking for more. Exhibits seem to skip forward a lot: i.e. Jamestown, Revolution, Civil War... With very little discussion about what happened in between. It's good, but I expected more -- most of the museum's space seems to be given to an  event hall and library.",
   "A good overview of the state. They should keep the exhibition of African-American history in the Commonwealth on permanent display. Still has some Confederate displays from their time as the Confederate Museum.",
   "Everyone needs to visit this place and get educated. Anyone who visits this place and then still thinks anything about the Confederacy should be celebrated, glorified and honored is a kook. The Charlie Brown exhibit was awesome!",
   "They provides a full view of history, and done a good job to lay the history out in that space. They incorporates the both the original sense of history and the contemporary progressive ideas.",
   "I am very glad to visit this museum in Richmond.  The exhibits were put together very well and believe me, it's a lot to digest, especially The Story of Virginia.  One of the temporary exhibits that was available (the last day will be the 21st) is Fresh Murals, which showcases paintings from local artists.  All I can say they will start conversations on Virginia's past and how far we can move toward the future.  Pictures below will be from all the artists.  Enjoy."

   "Really enjoyed touring the BHM.  The facility is modern, spacious and well laid out.  Having a volunteer guide walk us thru the museum, helping us to know what's available in each of the galleries was extremely helpful. Our guide was very good at prodding us w contextual questions. Like the paradox of TJefferson who wrote \"that all men were created equal\" yet built and sustained his farm at Monticello by maintaining 607 slaves. By comparison, the Virginia Museum of History and Culture currently has an exhibition: \"Determined: 400 Years of African American Struggle for Equality\". This is excellent! I only wished BHM would have half of the content and vision of that temporary exhibit. VA's history is steeped in the injustice and struggle for African-Americans' equality.  I predict BHM would grow in prominence by better telling the black experience for emerging, waking generations if told from a VA perspective.",

The permanent exhibit here is wonderful. Lots to learn from the large touchscreen in the hallway.  I've also seen some wonderful rotating exhibits come through on the second floor. If you've never been here, you'll want to check it out."

Brown's Island and Belle Isle. Brown's Island is grass and sidewalk covered and great for public outdoor events and concerts. Belle Isle is tree covered, surrounded by large boulders, with the James River flowing around and over the rocky terrain that encircles it. A wide walking and biking trail follows the river around the island in a circle. Belle Isle is accessible by a footbridge that is a short walk from Brown's Island. A sure bet for an enjoyable outdoor adventure for friends, family, or anyone. A+",

Great for walking or bike riding.  I will say, having walked it at night, that most of the lights were out, which doesn't compliment the rest of the walk.",
   "My first time walking this tour. Between the mix of architecture, especially in the banking district and the natural beauty of the river and forestry at play, makes for an awe inspiring scenic tour.",
   "I lived here for years! Why have I never taken this walk?! I moved out of state a decade+ ago only to visit over the 2018 winter holidays and find this gem. It's a wonderful activity to do with family and friends. The sights are beautiful. Along the canal there are historical landmarks, rock climbing, biking/walking trails, photography ops, and fresh air. It's a clean walk and was very fun with my family. We had a two year old with us too and it was a great sensory experience for him."

   "Awesome addition to The neighborhood.  Architecture is cool and vibrant.  The layout of the museum is nice, but I don't think they use it to their advantage.  I was not impressed with the exhibits on display.  We thought the lobby was more interesting!"

   "Went jogging here on a crisp morning.  Lovely trail.",
   "Its a little park nice for families or a stroll",
   "It's a beautiful park with several beautiful, scenic areas that are great for walking or maybe a picnic.  The VITA trail is one mile and has different fitness stations along the way. It is a scenic trail with even terrain. I enjoy taking my son out on the trail in his stroller. Also what's nice about the park is it is surrounded by some beautiful lakes. Fountain Lake is very pretty. It is a half mile around and has benches all along the perimeter in case you just want to sit and take in the scenery. Also, Fountain Lake is the only spot in the area that I have found that has a building with restrooms. Swan Lake is stunning, but the sidewalk does tend to be dirty on account of the birds. Definitely worth visiting though. Swan Lake is serene. Byrd Park also has other neat areas to visit, such as the Virginia War Memorial and the Dogwood Dell Amphitheater (which I believe hosts concerts during the summer).  Overall, I am a huge fan of Byrd Park. It is family friendly, great for walks, playing, or just sitting and taking in the beautiful scenery!",
   "I recently discovered the vita course here and it's a 3.8 mile return trip from my front door. Great power walk and fitness trail for anyone to go at their own pace. A wonderful find.",
   "A nice park where I occasionally do my weekend run. Lots of ducks and geese around. Some sketchy types pop up once in a while, but the area seems safe enough."

Trails are definitely designed more for bikers than hikers, but they do have them designated so you\u2019re not competing for trail space with the bikers & all of the trails get equal wear & tear."

We all got on the go carts and bumper boats, played putt-putt, had pizza for dinner, we ended the trip playing arcade games inside. It was a lot of fun and we will definitely be going back. They have good deals for families, outdoor activities with pizza and drink and indoor for games, making it a little more affordable. We had as much fun as the kids did.",
   "I have been here several times from childhood to adulthood.  It is one of the few entertainment places for kids that has outstood the test of time.  I take my children here periodically.  This particular time, we only did golf; however they have a decent arcade inside.  Outside is the golf, water boats and go-karts, all of which we have enjoyed at one time or another. You have 3 courses to choose from for golf.  We chose the first course with 18 holes of varying difficulty but just plain fun family activity.  I did notice there was a little trash and no water in the exhibit which could've taken it to the next level if corrected.  I also think there should be a better barrier around the bottom of the gate that encloses the golf area; I saw numerous people losing balls, by putting them into the parking lot accidentally.  I did like that there benches throughout so you could sit while the next person is putting and there were stations to write on your scorecards. We purchased a 12 attraction ticket for $60 so we will be back when it gets warmer for the water boats and go-karts.",
   "Been coming here since I was a kid, now bringing my daughter here to spend some weekend fun time.",
   "I used to come here when I was a kid. I loved it then and it still has it. The games and go-karts still satisfy the kiddos. Also nice the tickets go back to your game card so no keeping up with all that.",

Some more interior designing would've allowed experiencing the architecture in innovative ways. The gallery was being used to display the entrants of a children's design completion. Actually that was great. I love seeing community involvement.\n I would say don't write it off. The Branch is shooting signs that there is reconstruction and remodeling occurring. It should warrant a visit when spending time visiting there local museums.",

This park should be great place to walk and or bike, but too many people choose to ignore the leash law for their dogs. We were accosted by 2 large dogs today.

   "This place is amazing at night. My son is getting crazy if we visit here at night. this is well maintained trails. it is one of my absolute favorite views in Richmond and it's easy to visit and not crowded at all. Good place to go for the walk.",
   "Great walk with the view of the city and James river. It may need some clean up with the abandoned factory and parking lot but it was a cool little adventure and it seems to be a great start of a running trail",
   "I don't know what I did but won't pop up with you across the bridge or whatever the case may go to Rohnert Park have a good day enjoy yourself let me see what's going on you know it's just a city with the flood wall I don't understand that I'm going to get back to water money rains so that's a good thing you always nice to have a friend walk in the doors are made of concrete",
   "Dramatically scenic spot ... if you're in the neighborhood, drop by."

   "Gorgeous any month of the year and most importantly, year round interest. I went in January and still found new things in bloom and winter interest. Also more kid-friendly and interactive than I would think. Hit the kids area in the back, build a gnome home, and watch your kids playing like we did as kids in the woods while you enjoy the tranquility of the flowers and the calm (obviously I have young children).",
   "Vising the festival of lights is a fun family activity. It's easy to get around and the atmosphere is very festive. Some years are better than others, but I still recommend going. Going a bit later in the evening will help you avoid the crowds. Buy your tickets online to make entry quick and easy. Small children may enjoy seeing the lights (for a little while) but there really isn't a whole lot for them to do.",
   "Visited in December during a mild evening. Beautiful light display for the holiday. The library at this garden is incredible. I was really impressed with their seed sharing program - very organized. The gift shop is massive. If I lived locally, I would visit monthly!",
   "Lewis Ginter is not only a beautiful location to visit for both locals and from out of town, but also a spectacular wedding venue. The staff are wonderfully helpful to both vendors and guests alike. I had the honor of photographing a client's wedding in the gardens during the spring and was blown away by how sweet and accommodating the workers and event staff were and my bride and groom had nothing but fantastic things to say about their experience as well. 10/10 will absolutely recommend the venue to future clients.",
   "One of our family's favorite outings.  Absolutely breathtaking.  Every season had its own magic - never a missed opportunity to enjoy nature's bounties.  Awe inspiring and effortless exercise - don't even notice the mileage you put in out there, lol.  The kids don't even complain..."

   "Awesome place that's tucked away from the public. There are some rapids over here that are calming to watch and fun to ride, as well as a calmer area further down that's great for the whole family. It's a tight squeeze to get to any of the beaches, especially if you're there when other people are coming or going, but once you're there the place is just magical.",
   "I lovely and picturesque beach and rocks. Don\u2019t let the pipeline in the name fool you. If the blue herons don\u2019t mind it, you shouldn\u2019t either. No wheelchair access.",
   "High adventure, walking tour around Riverfront Canal area led me to this area by accident.  I arrived with several people, I described what I was looking for. They confirmed the location. You won't find this long name spelled out. I walked the rails, didn't quite trust my balance over the Pipeline that crosses over to Brown's Island. I will return after some balance training, maybe.",
   "Very cool little land mark. Walking ontop of the pipe can be slightly scary when the railings are gone but it's fun! Definitely worth a visit when you visit Richmond."

A public restroom. picnic shelters, plenty of parking, and lakes one huge one that you can fish off of a designated pier and the other one is full of wildlife and underwater life with a museum that has more detailed looks at nature and has hours from 12- like 4 ir 5. A great place to take kids.",
   "My toddler and I love coming to visit Three Lakes Park, whether it be in the morning, afternoon, or evening. In the morning, we play on the 2 different large playgrounds and chase the geese. In the later part of the day, we will walk around the lakes, under the shady and cool trees. We enjoy visiting the nature center because we get to see a variety of fish, turtles, snakes and other animals."

The NPS has a visitors center in the historic Tredegar building that was used to make ammunition for the confederate state during the Civil War. There is a museum that accompanies the visitors center that tells the history of Richmond and the surrounding area before, during, and after the Civil War. The museum has treasured photos of the destruction of Richmond and maps that give a time period marking all events from 1861-1865. The museum is free to all and parking is available right next door.",

   "Incredibly historical, being that Tredegar was of of the biggest manufacturers of weapons during the Civil War. The original artifacts, pictures and unique storytelling exhibits give you a good sense of what it was like to fight as a soldier on the front lines. For those who call Richmond \"home,\" the pictures from the 19th century are near to see as compared to what the city looks like today.\n\nWhen you're done with the museum, take a short walk to the river directly across the street for some hiking, swimming, paddleboarding and kayaking!"

Having been chased by an angry three-legged pig at one point in my life which started in much the same way (true story) this was the only interruption of the total serenity of this place. Meander don't run, but go. The long tree tunnel drive to the property is only the start of this magical experience. Park in the field, pay your $5 and enjoy \ud83d\udc95",
   "A hidden gem only 20 minutes away from the city. The Tuckahoe Plantation is an incredible building from the 1700\u2019s that still houses a family. What makes this place significant is this is where Thomas Jefferson spent several years growing up with his parents. There seems to be several architectural inspirations here at the Tuckahoe Plantation. Try to spot them if you can.  It\u2019s a simple place, but I would encourage you to schedule a tour before heading down. You can schedule a tour by going on their website."

   "A very nice park.  Has a large children's play gym and basketball court as you come in .  Soccer fields to the back .  Lots of parking.  Don't have knowledge of restroom facilities. Glad my grandson had his soccer game there so I had the opportunity to go and enjoy this gem in Chesterfield.",

Also, they have swings for adults, which I love. It has nice hiking  area too but beware of the snakes \ud83d\udc0d",
   "I really enjoy visiting here! It had an awesome, accessible playground, as well as restrooms,  tables, and pavilions. I think I even spotted some corn hole boards...\nOnly downside is that it can get very busy!",
   "Great place to play with the kids. They have a large sand box with some toys, that are showing heavy usage but still usable. My son didn't seem to care which is all that matters.\n\n The largest playground playset I have yet to see and designed to be used by any age really. Some swings as well, though they are only for small kids."

They made a brilliant use of the space the available space. I will be returning. I have only had lunch here so far and i am planning on coming back for dinner. Highly recommended.",
   "Good spot for lunch. I really like the aesthetics. Nice warm atmosphere with wood and bricks to bring a cozy feeling while you eat. Had the O'Brien with a soup side. The sandwich was delicious, striking a good balance between fillings and bread. The soup, can't remember the name, was the best part of the meal. A salty, sweet, creamy curry soup. Spicy with bits of nuts mixed in.",
   "Finally made it here for dinner.   Managed a bar spot at 730pm with ease.  Thet had just changed the menu so it didn't match the website which was a disappointment.    Food was good, cocktails creative but service kind of distant and strained.  I will still go back and this is a must stop especially because it doesn't always pop up on simple web searches",
   "I stopped by Lucy's on my way to Dillon on the Amtrak. This was truly the highlight of my brief stay in this city. This place is small and on the night I came, it was full but not crowded. Probably because it was the Saturday before christmas and folks were either broke or out shopping. I say at the bar and I was tended to by Katie who crafted excellent drinks and kept me filled on the most wonderful bread imaginable. I started off with the Cavender, Stranahans whiskey, Averna, Amaro & orange bitters. This was a great drink and Katie really put her heart into making it. She was a great multi tasker able to make a drink and take orders from servers walking to the bar. She also kept my water filled as well as my bread. For an appetizer i had the veggie cakes which were kind of bland and uneventful. Carrots and spinach. I am not really on the health kick movement so maybe I should have passed on this one. Next I ordered the fried oysters. These were a perfect ten. I could have ordered three more of these and made them a meal and considering how uninspiring my main dish was, I should have done just that. They came over bacon collard greens. You just know anything over bacon is going to be good. Now for my main dish I had the Colorado lamb shoulder. It sounded good on paper but I guess i got confused with lamb chops, like those tiny grilled lollipop type things with the bone sticking out, but this was like pulled pork. My problem was with the presentation. As soon as it hit the table I was like WTF is that pink stuff on top of my meat? F4om the picture you will see that it just was not appetizing. I take it that it was cranberry butter. This dish had a lot going on.Lamb shoulder, butternut squash, pecan apple bread pudding and that pinkish blob which i guess was the cranberry butte mixed into the bread pudding making it like a pink bread pudding. The apple pie was nothing special and I should have passed on that. But the menu is quite enticing. I would strongly consider either the cherry glazed duck breast or the pig and chicken salad next time. The bread was incredibly delicious and it was always delivered hot and fresh. Katie is what made this a five star experience for me. The lamb was not bad when I had it for leftovers the next morning. Overall I was extremely satisfied with the welcome i received, the attention at the bar, the expertly crafted drink, the ambiance, the timing of the presentation of the meals, the fresh bread, the creativity behind each dish and the price.  I will definitely be back again the next time I am in Richmond",
   "Delicious brunch, amazingly friendly servers, very reasonable prices, all in a lovely, cozy space. We had brunch there while exploring the street festival, and loved everything. The ambiance is great. It's extremely nice and clean inside, with thoughtful touches large and small to be found. The servers were super friendly and helpful, and all around nice people. The star of the show is the food. Our brunch was absolutely delicious. We had grits with shredded pork and eggs, and it was amazing. Our side of roasted potatoes was creamy, a little sweet, and not oily or heavy at all. My favorite were the bacon donut holes. Crispy on the outside and heavenly soft on the inside. We will most certainly be coming back, and we almost decided to come back for a second brunch later in the same day!"

Never pressured us to along.\n\nFood was excellent. I had the corned beef hash, made fresh in house. Tried my buddies bagel and lox. Both the best I've had anywhere around. Ate it all before my camera had a chance!\n\nWill be back and highly recommend!",
   "This was recommended to us by a lot of locals so we changed our plans for brunch from somewhere else and went here instead. Definitely recommend coming here. The food was good, the wait staff was friendly and helpful. It was a little slow which is the only reason it\u2019s not a 5, but overall would definitely come back. Pictured is the Benny Goodman",
   "Have been here twice - enjoyed it so much the first time that we had to come back when passing through Richmond. Everything is really well done. Loved the fish board! The bagels, cream cheese, and lox options were all delicious and perfectly complemented by a variety of pickled things. Perly's has easily become a favorite that I will gladly continue to return to for an enjoyable meal and fun atmosphere.",
   "Great food and generous proportions! Authentic like my mother in law made!  Only problem, we purchased bagels to take home and they were hard and stale!  We expected them to be the same quality as the food. We certainly will give it another try.",
   "If you don't get the schlubby fries you're a heathen. Brunch isn't brunch without the salmon Benny. They have the only good bagels downtown. The wait on weekends is bananas. 45min to over an hour. But Stella's is next door and they're happy to have you wait there."

   "Delicious food and great service. Also, the cocktails were incredibly tasty. I liked that there was a nice space in between getting our appetizer and entrees. Some restaurants tend to rush and bring out entrees before you've even finished with the app; but The Roosevelt staff were all very attentive and the pacing of the meal was perfect. Perfect place for a nice night out when you want to enjoy your meal and company and not feel rushed.",
   "Special Valentine's Day menu. Every single bite was amazing from the lamb tartar to the scallops to the chocolate cake. Best scallops I've had in years! Must go!",
   "My first exposure to The Roosevelt was a quick phone call to make sure they had bar seating. My call was answered by a charming lady who not only assured me they do, but that I could get a full dinner menu. She even confirmed my arrival time to make sure I could be seated when I arrived. The drive from my hotel was somewhat I retesting because the neighborhoods I had to drive through were somewhat sketchy, but where the place is located is actually a very nice neighborhood going through a rebirth, with lots of young professionals, although the only parking available is on-street, but not metered.  When I went into the beautifully restored building I was met by the woman with whom I spoke, and she greeted me by name. I grabbed a seat at the bar after she introduced me to the bartender, Jesse. The bar was extremely well-stocked with top shelf and local liquors and wines, but only three craft beers and one cider. Their mixing ingredients are all fresh, locally-prepared and extensive. Herbs for muddling are in a planter on the bar along with an entire collection of various shrubs and fruits which Jesse regularly utilized in the creation of a number of high-end signature cocktails. And even as busy as he was, he still made time to chat with me about music, drinks, and whatever. The menu was diverse and matched the online version, so I  was able to order based on what I had seen online. The harder part was selecting a wine from the extensive menu. I ordered the seared scallops, which were excellent, although for the price, I would've hoped for a larger portion. Since I was still hungry, I went back for dessert, an excellent little dish of absolutely decadent chocolate mousse. Overall, an excellent meal in great surroundings hosted by great people.",
   "We were spending the night in Richmond and happened upon The Roosevelt. What a fortunate find. The atmosphere is very cool, old hardwood floors, tin ceilings, very high. The service was top notch and the food was even better. My wife had the chicken fried portobello mushroom and I had the pan roasted scallops...we shared the roasted beet salad for an appetizer and the peanut butter pie for dessert. We started the night with drinks and liked mine well enough to ask for a recipe which the bartender came over and shared. Turned out to way too involved to make at home but man it was good. We will eat here again in an instant, next time we are in Richmond!"

   "Celebrated an anniversary dinner at Lemaire recently. Have always loved the Jefferson for its rich history, architecture and historic Richmond feel. The restaurant is located near the hotel check-in area and has a very active/popular bar right outside of the dining area. This can be highly trafficked on a Friday evening during happy hour, but we were able to find a place to sit and have a drink before our reservation. Wait staff was helpful and kind. As with most public areas of the Jefferson, the bar and restaurant have wonderful high ceilings and mouldings that create great ambiance and character of the hotel.",
   "Beautiful, calm atmosphere. Wonderful food & wait staff. Extra touches offered free of charge.",
   "The food was delicious. The setting is rich in history. You can feel comfortable dressing up (though some people still wear jeans \ud83d\ude44). While the wait staff was attentive, I was surprised that our waiter never offered the drink menu back after we finished our first drinks, even with the empty glasses moved to the edge of the table. If asked, I likely would have gotten a glass of wine to go along with my meal after I finished my cocktail, but didn't feel strongly enough to call the waiter out on it. Anyway, this is more of a 4.5 because we have had great experiences in the past too.",
   "High-end experience during the holidays\nWhat's not to enjoy?  Always have a great time celebrating at Lemaire. Food and service is exceptional.  The butternut squash soup was spectacular.",
   "Excellent service and food was very good. The salmon was phenomenal. The honey pot dessert was delicious."

   "I took my boyfriend here for our second anniversary and we had a memorable experience! We looked at previous reviews for this place before we arrived and were not disappointed. The escargot was absolutely amazing. Not at all chewy and rubbery like one would think snails would be like. I\u2019m not even a fan of escargot, but these were seriously the best I\u2019ve ever had and would recommend to anyone who enjoys escargot. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask what a dish is. The wait staff are prepared and ready to answer in detail to any questions you may have.  The ambience and decor.. is certainly interesting. Very quirky and fun place. If you are planning on dining here, I would advise to make a reservation a few weeks ahead as this place is very quickly booked.",
   "The atmosphere is cozy, with a contrast of dark woods and beautiful light. The decorations are new but have a nostalgic feel to them. The long bars are inviting and the staff is really nice. And there's something about a nice atmosphere that relaxes everyone and makes them friendly, which is part of what I love about this place. I always make new friends here without even trying.",
   "Everything about this place is aMAZing! The people, the decor, and definitely the food. It truly was art. The crab cakes were by far the best I've ever had. Absolutely an adventure beginning to end.",
   "Unique atmosphere and one of a kind food for the most part. Some variations on some old classics that are used all over. But delicious non the less.",
   "This place was highly recommended to me and I found it to be underwhelming. I was excited upon entering, the staff were excellent and the decor was amazing. The water was mint infused and delicious and I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into some yummy food. We ordered their special appetizer, a creamy crab concoction on top of pureed spinach (sort of looked like flan). Which was yummy, my partner enjoyed it but the mushiness threw me off. I was still excited as this was a personal preference turn off.  Alas, while the food was good I did not feel it was good enough to justify the price and it did not blow us away. I got the Swank Bank, which was advertised as mac n cheese, but it was served with shell pasta (not macaroni) and had a liquid creamy cheese sauce rather than the gooey cheese that I had anticipated. It was very buttery and while it was good, I was not blown away. My favorite part about the dish was the asparagus and the leafy greens at the bottom. My partner ordered the Beef \"Swellington\" which he said was over salted, but still good. He shared the same sentiment that I did, good food, but not amazing food. The best part about his dish was by far the mushroom, which he generously shared half of the only mushroom on his plate with me. The mushroom was amazing and very yummy. We opted out of dessert and alcoholic drinks. All in all I don't regret my visit, but I am not salivating to return."

The cost is simply not comparable to the meals that either myself or my friends have experienced on multiple attempts. Optimism in the variety brings us back, but we are always underwhelmed by bland flavoring or small portions. The staff is excellent, informed and courteous.",

It's a must have.",

The wine list was good as well. \n\nOn the way in I noticed several great selections of whiskey. It was quite and cozy with an excellent wait staff. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
   "Magnificent restaurant with local ingredients, wonderfully prepared dishes and outstanding customer service.  The restaurant boasts a gorgeous dining room in the newly constructed Libbie Mill development.  It has very few competitors in Richnond who can deliver at this level!",
   "Wonderful salmon, excellent service.\n\nThis is a little higher end than I usually eat, but this place doesn't throw it in your face the same way some places do. Their focus is on providing quality food with quality service and by both measures they succeed.\n\nGood for couples or groups of varying size, with a good range of selections to fit most diets. They also know their way around a duck, a particularly valuable trait these days.",
   "The food was great, and the rest of the dining experience was about what I would expect of a three dollar sign restaurant.   \n\nI'm only giving 3 stars because I hope management takes note of below to improve future interaction with others.\n\nI am however sadly disappointed in the care of customers needs.  We had made a reservation early in the dining timeframe, and I had clearly requested in my reservation a seating request to help the evening go more smoothly.  However, when we arrived, and we were the first guests to be seated in the dining area, the complete opposite of my request was granted.  One seat backed to the middle of the dining room, and the other backed to the bar and beside the waiter station/service bar.  The place was empty so I didn't make a fuss about it as I figured it would make little difference when not busy,  I wish I had.  About half way through our dining the place near instantly filled and all the difficulties that I had hoped to avoid were as bad as they could be. \n\nI hope that in the future, when your establishment receives a request that someone took the time to write and explain why, that at least a shred of effort is put in to accommodating that request."

My monk fish was even better than the rock fish we had shared our first time here.  Fried broccoli is a must have.  This is our most favorite restaurant in Richmond - more enjoyable than the famous hotel."

   "Wonderful service (at the bar), staff are very polite and welcoming. Drinks were tasty, but not a good selection for vodka drinkers. There appeared to be several varieties of every other type of spirit though. Nice wine selection. Tasty small plates. Great atmosphere. Overall pleasant experience.",
   "Amazing food, great service, loud as hell. Really flavorful dishes, not overtly Latino in the usual way but perfectly inspired. Cauliflower and skate wing small plates and pork and hanger steak large plates were all hits. Otherwise an excellent date spot but it was deafeningly loud and the tables are a bit crowded.  I would definitely still return.",
   "This is one of my favorite Richmond gems. It is tiny so you will need reservations. We had a large group of people and ended up ordering just about everything on the small plates menu and it was all amazing. This place is known for amazing cocktails. If you're not sure what to order tell your server what you like and the bartender will be able to come up with something fabulous. Our server was amazing and super sweet all night.",
   "Great experience! Food is innovative and Rich. At first glimpse of the menu, you may be thinking that there is not a lot here. Oh, but it is! The food is super creative and flavorful. This was our first visit here and we will be back for sure!",
   "Have been here before for food and it is definitely 5 stars! But also a great cozy place to swing in for a cocktail or two. It's in a GREAT location for easy walking to some fun entertainment! Love the super kind and efficient service I have gotten every. single. time."

   "Beautiful Restaurant, amazing food and generous drinks. I visited Brenner Pass for New Years with my husband and friends. Located in Scott\u2019s Edition and away from the busy area. Parking was available close by. Everything we ordered was delicious. I can\u2019t recommend this place enough. Be prepared for a pricier meal but it is well worth it. Service was great. Come here for a special occasion. Lobster Risotto and Scallops just melt in your mouth. Best dessert was the tiramisu.",
   "Service that was both fantastic and above 'n beyond any expectations. Phenomenal food and cocktails, with a few special liquor selections too. A great place for celebrations of all kinds - especially anniversaries.",
   "I like this place more for the ambiance than for the food. But if you really want a fun experience, ask for the cheese cart. If you are ordering a cheese plate they will bring around this cheese cart (like a dessert cart) and explain all the cheeses to you. Then you can sample the ones that peak your interest before you place your cheese plate order. Genius.",
   "Another great restaurant in Richmond Virginia. The garlic soup as an appetizer is simply amazing. The service was stellar. As expected the roysters were way overpriced. The Friday wasters were delicious. And the artichoke was incredible. It's a little cold inside. It she can modern but lacks a little character. Over all the experience was grand. I will be back to taste more...",
   "This evening we have enjoyed a fabulous meal at Brenner Pass. In the past we have liked some offerings at this eatery but tonight absolutely everything was perfectly prepared. I began with the Ocean Spray Cocktail which was tart and refreshing followed by the Arugula and Apricot Salad with Pistachio Vinaigrette which was delicious and large enough to share. For entree I chose the Saffron Risotto with Crab which was extremely fresh and flavorful. My husband enjoyed the Halibut with Charred Vegetables with an unusual and altogether tasty sauce. We concluded our meal by sharing a fantastic dessert of fruit, toasted hazelnuts and pistachio ice cream on spicy pound cake...I've forgotten the name of the dish but not the great taste. The flavor combinations at Brenner Pass are unusual and sometimes surprising but you won't find a better meal anywhere and service that is prompt efficient and pleasant. A truly great experience!"

   "For my wife\u2019s birthday we always do Italian food. We decided to go away for her birthday so we ended up in Richmond. Found this place and it had good reviews so we checked it out.\n\nPro: The ambiance was great and the restaurant is really nice. The service was good/helpful as well. The food was fine, nothing to write home about but not bad. The pizza was good though, that I recommend\n\nCon: We originally order Focaccia as an appetizer. When they brought it out we were told this was the last one they had. What they gave us resembled, both in look and taste, was regular table bread. We told the waitress who told us this was their focaccia. They took it back and it wasn\u2019t on the bill(thank you by the way). The other food we got was fine.",
   "Nota Bene is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Richmond.  Actually, one of my favorite restaurants period.  The food is delicious, and the service is warm and welcoming.  It's a great place to have a fancy date, or just a casual meal at the bar.  Always happily full and pleased with my experience every time I eat here.",
   "This is my FAVE place in Richmond. My boyfriend and I are regulars there now, and the staff always welcome us. Our favorite thing to do is go for Tuesday Date Night ($60 for 3-course meals, for 2! And a bottle of wine). We both highly recommend Nota Bene\u2013\u2013authentic, delicious, and memorable.",
   "I ordered white bolognese and it was amazing eventho portion wasn\u2019t filling and I felt I needed a lot more to feel stuffed. My wife ordered this branzino and it was super aesthetically pleasing and can\u2019t comment on fish taste since I don\u2019t like seafood specially fish.",
   "The food was excellent. I'll go back again for the mushroom pasta. Heirloom tomato appetizer was outstanding."

   "Sausage, Broccoli Rabe - a meal to rave about! A perfect amount of heat spices this pasta and Italian sausage dish.  I crave it. Huge portion allows for ample leftovers fit for another meal. Lunch time is my favorite time to go; relaxing with great people watching from the second floor windows overlooking Harrison. Perfection.",
   "Hidden gem! It\u2019s a must go to in Richmond. I can\u2019t get enough of the broccoli rabe and fried squid. I take everyone that\u2019s visits here! They definitely know how to cook and make the best combinations of flavor I\u2019m each meal. The staff so friendly and welcoming. It can be noisy when busy but the food is so good it doesn\u2019t matter!",
   "Way underpriced for what you get!  My daughter and I were looking to catch a quick bite before the symphony at the Alistra and this place came up in reviews.  It's only about a  9 minute walk from the theater. \n\nAdmittedly, we weren't sure we were in the right place when open the door and see a sketchy looking walk-up you assume you're going to the employee entrance of the restaurant that's downstairs. We were going to pass based on the entrance until we saw happy faces coming out. \n\nI'm glad we went up that sketchy walk-up.  It's a single room restaurant, with moderate bar and you can see into the alley kitchen from the dining area, but those quirky things make it charming. \n\nThe servers were fantastic and the menu is simple.  The food was incredibly good and I especially liked the steamed muscles.  The portions are very large for lunch and the price was much lower than I had anticipated.  \n\nIt is a small area and were literally sitting side-by-side with other diners, so if you're looking for a quiet restaurant to have a private conversation, this isn't it.  However, everyone we sat near was pleasant and happy."

With sandwich or entree takes on those main proteins. \n\nSide dishes are generously sized and really big enough for two people. Salads are very large. \n\nVery friendly staff and reasonable prices round out the experience.",
   "This place is fantastic. Everything I've ever ordered here has been just delicious. I highly HIGHLY recommend the catfish. They have the best collard greens I've ever had in my life and their sweet tea is amazing too. Don't forget to finish your meal with a very generous slice of cake- it doesn't matter which one you get because they are all fantastic. Their staff are all super friendly and service is prompt as well. All around 10/10, you can't go wrong choosing to eat here.",
   "This restaurant is amazing! We went on a Monday night and had only a 15 minute wait to be seated. My party of four all enjoyed their entrees. I had the fried catfish with a side of cabbage. Perfect crisp on the fish, succulent cabbage, both nicely spiced but not too much. The rest of our group had the fried chicken. They raved about the crispiness, moist meat and flavor. We got coconut cake and peach cobbler to go--yum! We will definitely be repeat customers, we all loved Mama J's Kitchen!",
   "Fries catfish was delicious. The catfish nuggets were similar to the fried catfish. Candied yams were a little too sweet as expected. Peach pie was delicious. Fried chicken plate was also great. The Mac and cheese was a little disappointing. Staff was super friendly. Easy to find parking",
   "Honestly wasn\u2019t impressed with what we ordered.  (Ribs and chicken) The sides were decent but nothing to tell your neighbor about.  However the couple sitting next to us seemed to enjoy their picks.  We may just need to revisit and try something else on the menu. The cake looked amazing, may also be worth another try."

   "Our first visit to Bookbinders was in January. It's located in a nice convenient area, and has a little history to it. The service is quite good, but not spectacular. The ambiance was a bit dull during our visit. They have a great wine list. Standard cocktails. All of the dishes are cooked perfectly, especially the steaks. They must use high quality meats because the fillet and strip are to-die-for amazing; get an accompanying sauce. The lobster is wonderful and tastes so fresh. The scallops are also good. All of the appetizers are good, you can't go wrong with any of them. The sides are okay, not so special. Do not order the lobster mac and cheese here, as there was no visible lobster at all in ours. They say they pre-measure out 2 ounces of lobster for each lobster mac, but ours was definitely sans-lobster. They couldn't remake ours because the kitchen was closing so the waitress was to take it off our bill, but forgot. All of the deserts are good, as well as the desert wines. I would recommend Bookbinders for: specials group outtings, an anniversary, business dinners, a date night where you want to be treated.",
   "Family holiday dinner was superb! Party of 6 we received excellent and friendly service. The food was delicious and of course we shared a few cups of cheer. Really one of the best RVA restaurants. Merry Christmas!",
   "Food and service were amazing. The menu looked so good, we were undecided on what to get. Definitely a top class place with great service and an amazing chef. We will be back to try some more menu items.",
   "I took my wife to Bookbinders for a romantic evening.  We ended up paying a little over 200 dollars for our meal, and to be honest it was more than worth the price.  Actually, I would have gladly paid 300 for our meal. \n\nI have dined all over the world and Bookbinders is now in my my top three for overall dining experiences ever.  Definitely top two for dining in Virginia.  \n\nI would like to thank the manager and staff for a truly top shelf experience.\n\n5 stars for every aspect of our incredible dinner.",
   "Food was excellent.  Everything tasted like it was well made and with care.  Waiter was very helpful in recommendations for both food and drinks (Wine).  Service was fairly fast and prices were decent for the quality of restaurant."

   "We came here for brunch on Sunday. I only wish it opened at 11 instead of 11:30. Good thing we got here a couple minutes before it opened because we did not have reservations. The restaurant went from being empty to almost full very quickly! \n\nOur server was informative and did a great job. Their brunch menu had some good choices. A welcome surprise was complimentary chunks of soft bread with fruit in it, one for each of us that came out before our meal. \n\nFor brunch, we went with the quiche and the stuffed apple French toast. Portions were much bigger than expected! Very generous. The quiche was divine\u2014 so soft and it practically melted in your mouth. It came with some salad greens. \n\nStuffed French toast was like a sandwich, and it also came with bacon and tiny square-shaped cut apples around it. Dessert was the chocolate tarte which was a square shaped chocolate mouse with raspberry sauce around it and a scoop of cream with a raspberry on top. It\u2019s one of my favorite brunch places thus far.",
   "Thanks to a bartender who took the time to listen to the things I enjoyed, I decided to have lunch at the wonderful Amuse Restaurant, located on the top level of the museum overlooking their beautiful grounds. The space is flooded with natural light that immediately lifts your spirits, and prepares you for your amazing meal and cocktails. Perfect for a small group or large. Just remember to make a reservation!",
   "Consistently rated as one of the top fine dining restaurants in Richmond, Amuse serves creative dishes in a delightful setting, within the Virginia Musem of Fine Art. There are two dining rooms indoors, an adjacent  bar area, and a large outdoor balcony for dining as well. It is only open limited evenings during the week, and it is best to make reservations.",
   "This restaurant goes hand-in-hand with the art museum it sits on top of!  Beautiful, natural lit location with fantastic decor.  The menu was a bit limiting, and the options weren't as tasty as we thought they would be, but it was still good food with great atmosphere and staff!",
   "Love Amuse. We've visited this restaurant several times. I dont think we have had any complaints. The staff is wonderful, the drinks are creative, and the food is great."

Totally overlooked us and then I watched her the entire time. Even when I very kindly asked if she was our waitress, she said yes, but then sent one of the bartenders to service us. That bartender/waitress was nice however, just prior to her waiting on us I went to the bar to order us drinks(thinking that would prompt our waitress to come to us after waiting on the white couple that was seated after us). Got our drinks but was told she didn\u2019t swipe my card and handed it back to me saying they\u2019d just add it to our food bill. Well guess what? She did swipe it and charged my card for  the drinks and then they also put the drinks on our bill!!!!  That was so disappointing! The food was delicious though.",

   "Serving size was fantastic. I was able to eat on my fish dinner for 2 days. I gave 4 stars because my broccoli was barely steamed. It may have been an off day... the mac n cheese looked fantastic but wasn't flavorful."

   "Lovely restaurant with multiple cozy spaces for dining. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings. We had the wine dinner and we were not disappointed. The servings were large and every bite was delicious. We were dressed for a casual concert at The National and it wasn't an issue. We'll be back for sure! Thanks!",
   "La Grotta was recommended to us by a friend and boy are we glad that did. This is the quintessential Italian date night restaurant.  Great wine, pasta, and bread.  We had the ravioli with ricotta and spinach and a fettuccine with creamy tomato sauce. Both were so creamy and delicious, despite being full we ended up eating all of the food! It was a great meal and we will be back if we are ever back in Richmond.",
   "Upscale Italian restaurant in downtown Richmond, located at the neighbor of Hilton. You can use the parking lot on either side of the restaurant (remember to pay).\n\nThe restaurant is suitable for dinning from two to the group of around 40. You can choose 3, 4 or 5 dishes or just select your entree. I\u2019ve tried seafood, beef and chicken, all are cooked with great texture and flavor. Different wine choices. The dessert is the best I\u2019ve ever had in Richmond. Chef is from Italy.\n\nWaiters and waitresses are professional. They tried to understand your need and give helpful suggestions.\n\nReservation is recommended, especially if you have a big group or you are to take dinner. They have a view of the Broad Street.",
   "Awesome service, great food and great wine selection! Our server Carolina was fantastic! We asked her to pick out our meal for our 5 course dinner and she did an amazing job. She also recommended our wine which was great! Very knowledgeable staff and great food. A must try for any Italian lovers.",
   "First time here and we chose the 3 course wine menu.  It was great.  They paired a different wine with each course.  It was nice to try wines we otherwise might not select.  Food was fabulous and plentiful."

   "Another fantastic fan restaurant. Quaint but full of personality, the inside reminds me of an old soda bar. \n\nThey're missing a Reuben, but nobody can be perfect. Sandwiches, both hot and cold are all unequivocally great. If you're into salads, they've got some interesting ones there too. Grab a soup and a slice of cake before you head out. As of today, they have a great deal for a date night.",
   "As good as the reviews say it is, got \"The Manny\", next time will try \"The Teacher\". Great fresh food and great service.",
   "What a nice little, neighborhood sandwich shop.  You walk into the small restaurant and you feel like you're in your Grandma's house.  The food is fantastic, there are always seasonal soups that are off beat but delightful.  The sandwiches don't reinvent the wheel but they show you what a classic is supposed to be and do it better than anyone else.  To top it off, there's always a few options for desert (usually pies and cakes) which are top tier in the city.  Some of the deserts are even gluten free (for any of you with Celiac's) and you can't tell.  Go check this place out.",
   "Great cozy place, the sandwich was delicious (The Point Guard). And to top off the great experience, they had Modest Mouse's \"The Moon and Antarctica\" album playing. Can't beat that!",
   "Great little deli in the neighborhood. Fantastic sandwiches and salads. Potato salad is amazing. Large portions of meat on the sandwiches and they have nice happy hour specials. \nIf it\u2019s a nice day it\u2019s great to eat at the small park across the street!"

   "We came for a special night out and loved it! The food was delicious and creative with enough of a comforting southern touch to let you know you\u2019re still in Richmond. We had excellent service and can\u2019t wait to visit again.",
   "I made a reservation online @12:42pm for a party of 6 for me and my family (4) kids. I received an email @4:32pm stating that the reservation was declined. I walk in not having any idea that a reservation can be declined. Fine that is my fault for not checking my email. However......the hostess makes a recommendation for me and my (4) kids to sit at the bar......like really? Been here 3 other times and absolutely love the flavor of the food. After this last episode though not sure if I\u2019ll be returning.....the bar ma\u2019am really???? With my (4) kids.....c\u2019mon",
   "Nice place to go to relax.  Bartender was awesome and served drinks that were well made.  Only 1 TV is available here so not the best place to go to for watching sports while having a drink.  Happy hour prices were fairly good!",
   "I came here for Restaurant Week and made reservations. They asked if we could sit outside since they didn't have space inside and the weather was nice so we sat outside. It was fine but what bothered me was that bare tables outside were kinda dirty. They didn't wipe them down or anything. They would put new utensils on the table before each course but they put the utensils on the dirty table without a napkin or anything underneath. Also some  of the courses came out not hot. For example, I had the biscuits and gravy appetizer and the apple pie dessert and both came out very lukewarm/cold. I did not enjoy either. I did however get the shrimp and grits for my main course and that was delicious. I also thought the waiter was nice and always kept our water glasses full, but the girl who greeted us and sat us to the table was kind of rude.",
   "I had been meaning to go here for years, but last night was my first time. I was blown away by the service, the food, the chef, and the ambiance. I want to start with the hostess. Her outfit and demeanor was stunning with her pink dress and pearl necklace. So nice and polite and attentive. Then our waiter... so this guy... the class of this guy. Outstanding service all around from him. He even accommodated us when she said she couldn't eat the cornbread that came out first by giving us other options. The food came out later, and it was delicious. Fantastic shrimp and grits. Some of the best I've ever had, and definitely the spiciest. I was unaware I needed this in my life. I would happily come back here. Nothing but praise to the staff in all regards. Everyone should go. Now. Stop what you're doing and go. Even if they aren't open, just set up shop outside and wait til they do."

   "I had the Disco Eggs w/ Avocado with squash salad as my side and a Thai iced coffee. Everything was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. The local eggs especially were amazing with delicious orange runny yokes. No pretentiousness here to my eyes but dishes that are executed to a level that many other higher priced establishments don't match.",
   "Awesome breakfast/brunch spot.  Good spot for Bloody Mary\u2019s and laying down a solid base before hitting the breweries.  Very eclectic mix of breakfast options with amazing flavors, spices and taste.  Loved the Disco Eggs!  Go!  You won\u2019t be disappointed!",
   "Great place for breakfast. I had the pupusas and beet soup. Both were extremely delicious. The staff is very friendly and the vibe here is very cool. I'll definitely come back here again. The staff told me this gem of a place is shutting down in March, so eat up, people!",
   "The food was amazing and nicely portioned.  Staff was quick and professional in terms of service.  Seating is difficult and your party must be complete before they will seat you."

   "Tasty food. We went for lunch.  The baked oyster and baked mussel appetizers are great. For light eaters, the 3 small crabcake appetizer is fine. She crab soup is tasty, get the small one, very rich. The shrimp and scallop is a bit light for the price, 3 shrimp, 2 scallops. Service, was not impressive, water and ice team refills required flagging down a waiter. If the photos I submit stay attached to this review, take a look at the building shots, the place is hard to find and they have a very small sign.",
   "Very nice place to spend an evening. The food is delicious, the waiters are attentive, and the location is really nice. I loved my scallops and shrimps, and my son's steak was great. The prices were also reasonable.\nThe only downside is the strong smell of seafood.",
   "Just ate lunch here and it was amazing! The service was fast and the food was incredible at reasonable prices. We shared the lobster dip and I had the lunch special of the day which was grilled salmon over Brussels sprouts, goat cheese, and strawberries in an apple cider vinaigrette. This might be our new go to lunch spot!",
   "The Hard Shell has a lovely setup! The atmosphere is light and great on a Sunday evening! A group of us experienced them for a birthday dinner. The food was good, the were minor adjustments needed, and a few of our meals had to much seasoning as we asked for our shrimp and scallops to be blackened. Our waitress was amazing and tended to our every need. Another staff assisted me with a different hand soap for the bathroom because the original one had an ingredient I'm allergic too. The only other thing to think about when planning your experience is keep in mind parking. Hope you enjoy your own experience!",
   "We dined here on a Saturday night and choose to enjoy their lovely outdoor seating. Service was good and their bread service was respectable. My friend ordered a steak that was over cooked and I ordered the she crab soup and scallop appetizer for my dinner. The soup was bland AF but had a fair amount of lump crab. The scallops were amazing and the three you are served are worth the $15 price tag. One thing to note, while passing by the kitchen to use the restroom I heard a kitchen staff member (Caucasian male with a full on beard) berating the wait staff on their lack of speediness to deliver food. There is a way to go about motivating someone and away from customers is the first step. Other than the scallops The Hard Shell is average and I would not dine here again."

Would stop here again in a \u2764\ufe0f beat. Great service and bartender!!!",
   "Lisa Adams reviewing. We had a business meeting here and it was great. We came in around 11:30 am and were seated in the back in a charming room that fit all 10 of us nicely. The menu is eclectic and since they make a lot of their food items fresh, it allowed me to ask for certain ingredients, which are not on my diet, to be withheld. They were quite accommodating. We had 3 appetizers with our meal and when we ran out of bread for our dip, they brought us more. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals and the atmosphere. Parking at this time was easy. All in all, a wonderful experience.",

Like that the menu changes, depending on what they are getting fresh that week.   The only really downfall that I can see is sometimes parking downtown and with a small cooking area, if they are busy food can take a little longer, but usually well worth the wait.  Thanks for good food through the years!",
   "I came with my wife and brother in law and the food was great! I got the Castro mess which was basically pork, eggs, beans, green peppers and cheese with home fries. The meal was fantastic! My wife got the eggs Benny which was really good. I would highly recommend this place. It's a little small so seating could take some time. We showed up with our whole party and got seated right away. The service was good as well. If you're in the area and looking for a great brunch spot check this place out!",
   "Our first time at Millie's was very good! We were promptly greeted in a friendly manner and seated quickly. Ally our server was great. I ordered the Eggs Benny with a side of grits. My friend ordered the Scrambled Eggs with Lobster. We split the Lemon Pound Cake & Lemon Curd. The food was delicious and we'll definitely return again.",

The potatoes are amazing! I would have order another plate of it if I wasn't already overweight. Definitely on my list of top notch brunch restaurants.",
   "We were for team lunch and all of em like this small little cozy place tucked at end. Been here several times but for team it was mostly first for most of em. Food is really good, have to hit the place on time to avoid rush. They have street parking and also small dedicated parking right opposite over the hill adjacent to the gas station. I recommend this one and would go back soon."

I also usually dislike okra (the texture is not my favorite) but the okra at Comfort was really good and crunchy. A really pleasant surprise.\n(My only gripe would be that there was no changing table in the bathroom. My 4 month old and I made do with what was there, but it definitely took some finagling. I acknowledge that we\u2019re probably not the target demographic but still it\u2019s good to know if you have a baby with you and are going out in an attempt to feel like an adult person.)",
   "I will be sad to say goodbye to this RVA Institution.  That and all the good that Jason & Michelle have done for the community.",
   "Excellent fried catfish and veggies\u2014including sweet-sour collards I could not stop eating, which is saying a lot for collards.  Our daughter works at a highly rated BBQ restaurant and she liked the pulled pork. The cornbread was not appealing at first but with butter is actually very good and is probably more authentic than the sweet, cake-y stuff we are used to. Velveeta fans will like the mac and cheese but it was not to our taste.  We stayed at the Quirk and Comfort is right across the street",
   "One word, Butter! I could taste it in all the food it was so delicious. Even the broccoli was covered in some butter. The corn bread was to die for. The staff was wonderful the restaurant was cute, I love how they serve their water in Mason jars.  The only complaint I have is with any restaurant, I am trying to watch my sugar intake and if the servers wouldn't take it so personally if I only asked for water. I get it you want to make as much money as possible in a restaurant and some customers are cheep, but please don't give anyone an awful look when they ask for water only. You don't know if they trying to watch out for there health.",

Great bartenders and one of the better martinis I\u2019ve ever had. \nI was very surprised with the food, some people have told me that this is the part that is somewhat lacking but that was not my case. The salad and apps were amazing, and I had some of the best crab cakes ever. Tons of lump crab meat. My wife had a filet which was perfectly cooked and I had a few bites, it was a stellar steak. \nThis makes a great place for a special event or date.",
   "Beautiful and historical, 2 of my favorite combos. Staff is friendly and take time to walk around and check on the tables. The food was incredible, I had salmon and my friend had NY Strip. My friend asked for his meat to be rare. Initially he received a piece that was cooked too much. They took it back no questions asked and gave him a whole new piece, sides included again as well. He said it was the best piece of steak he ever had and it cut through like butter. Manager came by to check on the 2nd cut as well. Very happy that I got to experience a place of our history with amazing friends and food.",

Courtney was very patient and accommodating to our group but I am disappointed in her not stopping my mother from attempting to embarrass me during my birthday through the band that night.

The food was delicious and service was great. It is a funky old style dinner with a huge menu selection. They have their own off street parking.",
   "Ample parking, Spacious and clean restaurant. Menu has a large selection. I opted for the sliders with cheese on a bed of fries. I was not impressed. The fries felt like there was no potato inside, and the burgers tasted like White Castle. The pickles were great. I wish I had opted for something else. The nachos seemed appetizing. \nThe friend I went with loved his burger of the day with fries.  The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. \nOverall, not a \u201cknock my socks off\u201d experience. It was just average.",
   "This was our first time here. The food was good but the service was slow. No clean tables when we walked in. We were told to sit down at any table, so had to choose a dirty table and ask for it to be cleaned. It wasn't busy for a weekday so not sure why it was so slow to get service. I had the grilled zucchini and tomato sandwich which was delicious and my daughter had the pizza. It was okay. Bottom of pizza was soggy. We will try it again next time on that side of town.",
   "We came during the weekend for brunch. It's a nice location close to museums and the stadium. Price is right and the quantity was surprisingly generous. We will definitely come again.",
   "At first glance, this seems like a small, hole-in-wall place.  Done be fooled....this place is excellent.  I ordered the lamb chops, and I was very impressed. I am fairly picky about my meat and can't stand it overcooked.  They did a great job cooking it how I wanted.  It was moist and tender.  As well, the mixed vegetables were perfect. I live squash and zucchini, but I hate it when restaurants serve them over cooked, soggy and mushy.  These were nicely done, yet firm and crisp.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  I enjoyed my dinner and will definitely be back."

   "Had the Pickle and Fried Chicken Sandwich, friends had the Lions Den- both were delicious! Loved the outside covered area, beer garden. Will be back!",
   "Food was amazing. The drinks also hit the spot and we're very tasty. Lots of variety to choose from for everyone. The dinner side has the same menu as lunch, however, somethings were not included for breakfast/brunch time. Limited seating in both buildings, but there is an outside area to enjoy drinks.",
   "First visit, and I believe I was seated on the \"lunch\" side which is the smaller dining room to the right.   Got there around 2pm on a Saturday and it was busy but was able to be seated within 5 minutes.   Had the pork rinds and dip for an app and they were pretty good.  My entree was the Ferrytown sandwich, as I recall.   It was short rib meat topped with a small amount of macaroni and an onion ring.  Unique, but not all that great tasting.  The Texas toast bread was actually the best part.  Bathroom was tiny, had no paper towels.  Parking is a challenge.",
   "Showing my 22yr old niece Richmond and we stopped at Lunch, for lunch.  She thought it was one of the best meals she has ever had.  Atmosphere is great, we sat outside, had some good drinks and she tried some Ruby Red Moonshine, which she loved.  4 of us and we all enjoyed our meals.  I thought they had some very unique and southern blended menu items, like the pork rinds nachos, I want to give them a try.  Staff was attentive and friendly.  Will be going again.",
   "Winner! For lunch we shared some apps that were beyond good. Service was friendly, informed and spot on. Dinner has been excellent in the past and there is no disappointment for lunch. Treat yourself and friends. It is wonderful."

   "Food was amazing. The options are great for whatever you want. Even the sides that we had were good. Everyone was very nice and welcoming as well. Will definitely be back to try some other meats with some more brisket.",
   "Best Brisket I've ever had! Collards were extremely flavorful and delicious. Red cabbage slaw was crunchy and fresh. Jalapeno mac & cheese was Awesome. I'm sure everyone in town already knows how good the food is, the other stand out is how well thought out this concept is. There is a cafeteria style serving line where guests can see how fresh and high quality the food is before purchasing. Free loaf bread is available to enjoy with your meal. At the end of the serving line I paid for my food and the cashier offered to leave my tab open so I could get drinks from the bar, so I didn't have to run multiple tabs. Within 10 minutes of entering I had my food, my drinks, a clean table, and was enjoying myself in a warm upbeat environment. The only thing I think ZZQ could do better would be to offer some more kid friendly options, my son felt like the mac & cheese was too spicy.(it's not that spicy) I went back to the serving line for a few more pieces of loaf bread and put some brisket on it and that was good for him. Great food, great experience, five stars, definitely going back.",
   "Incredible experience front to back. Being greeted at the door by one of the owners and having the process explained is truly a great opening hand. Drinks are offered while you wait in the long (without fail) line. Once you get to the counter, the staff are all smiles and offer samples for some of the dishes. Everything was delicious, tender, and flavorful. Quite easily the best barbecue I've ever had in my entire life. Believe the hype.",
   "I'm going to make this simple. ZZQ has the best brisket of all time. Not even exaggerating. Super nice spot with indoor and outdoor seating. They gave us samples of the brisket while we were in line. One of the owners stopped and spoke to us while we were waiting, and checked in on everybody in the dining room. Really enjoyed ourselves. They also have a well stocked bar with plenty of good spirits. If you're in Richmond and love BBQ this should be your first stop. Get there early though. The word is out and you don't want to get there after they run out. This place is so good we actually heard about it on a radio station in DC!",
   "The food here is hands down delicious. They know how to handle the meats. We drove really fast to get there... because that's just how good it is. Lines out the door.. but the wait is more than worth it. A little pricey $$$. About $20 a person."

Be prepared to drop some good money on your drink but the presentation and quality is well worth it.",

   "Excellent service waiter was very responsive to whatever we needed. Atmosphere is airy and hip lots of cool plants hanging around and they have a swinging table which is unique. Food comes in huge portions two people could probably split one thing unless you\u2019re in collage and broke then you might wanna order two. Bathrooms are really cool and you can just tell in general that they put a lot of effort into the small things in this restaurant. Was very impressed and would absolutely return.",
   "Probably one of the best Thai food places I have had in Virginia and definitely the best in Richmond. \ud83e\udd29 \n\nBeautiful ambience, street views are amazing, terrific spicy basil fried rice and delicious ginger chicken",
   "This was my first time trying Thai food and boy they did not disappoint! I loved it all. The service, the vibe and the food were great! They have a parking lot but it's small but there are places to park that is in walking distance. I will be going back!"

   "Excellent all around experience. Friendly and attentive service, straightforward menu and ordering process. Food did not take long to come out. We got the fried chicken burrito and the bulgogi burrito. Highly recommended, will be coming back.",
   "I hate we popped in here for a quick lunch, because  I would have enjoyed staying a while and people watching.   My food was delicious and the service was quite enjoyable.   My cocktail was just what the doctor ordered on this busy day.  Absolutely take the time to read the whole menu before ordering because there are so many yummy options and you can\u2019t go wrong with the specials.  \nDefinitely will enjoy Wong Gonzalez again the next time I\u2019m in Richmond.\nXoxo Lorenzo",
   "The food is amazing!!! So many options and small enough to try a few different things. Also very reasonable prices and it's such a nice atmosphere. It is a small place so reservations are the way to go but a seat at the bar was cozy and perfect.",

   "We stopped in as we were passing through town and my partner and I really enjoyed our experience. The food was great. The menu was clear and easy to understand what was vegan and what was vegetarian (those vegetarian items are all possible to be made vegan). They were sadly out of some really attractive menu options that night but it was late and understandable. Service was very nice and friendly. We felt very cozy in the space too. Great for long dinners and conversations.",
   "Cool underground atmosphere at night. Helpful staff, and very accommodating for vegan and gluten free needs. The food is a bit expensive and tastes good... For vegan food.\n\nPictured is the sweet potato fries, the okonomiyaki-style vegetable pancake (I would recommend this), and an oyster-mushroom steak (would not recommend this).\n\nExtra tidbit: Ipanema is the name of a neighborhood in Rio, and the restaurant bears the name because the owner liked the song \"Girl from Ipanema\"",
   "A vegetarian and vegan eatery that is always a good trip. It is situated in a basement and on the VCU campus and a consistently rotating menu. Portions are a little small but they will always be good! I strongly recommend getting a pot of the vanilla tea to go with your meal too! They will drop off a whole kettle and small cups so you can keep refilling.",
   "Cool, lowly lit inside with booths and nice bar area. I\u2019m a carnie and thought the food was fantastic. Recommend the jackfruit mushroom dip and the Beyond Burger. Went for lunch on a Thursday and easily got a seat.",
   "I was welcomed warmly by the hostess as soon as I entered into this hidden gem. With my new years resolution of eating better it was great to find a vegetarian place that was affordable. I came alone and was greeted by the bartender who was very friendly while I sipped on the delicious house red wine. I ordered a beyond burger with sweet potato fries and they were both cook immaculately and soothed my taste buds. While eating the owner stopped by and asked about my experience and started a brief conversation with me which made me feel like family. I will for sure be back for more in the future. The atmosphere, food, drinks, and staff were splendid and made my evening amazing. Thank you Inpanema."

I would definitely be coming back for the food and the setting. Also you can go up to the rooftop for a cocktail and the ambiance is like Miami.",
   "Nice, bougie place. The decor is very nice and the food and service is also good. If we are talking fine dining in Richmond  there are better options for better food. You just have to know why you are coming to Maple and Pine for.",
   "I\u2019ve been here numerous times and always received great service and food but didn\u2019t know they could do even better! I made a reservation for my friend\u2019s birthday the day of and they made a special menu for her with champagne waiting and it truly made her and my day! The staff were friendly and the food was amazing. I was already planning to return but I may have to make this place a part of my routine because the service was phenomenal. Thank you all for an amazing time! We all plan to return soon.",
   "Maple & Pine Restaurant, located in the Quirk Hotel, was a great experience. The ambiance is more reminiscent of a restaurant in Miami Beach than Richmond. It made me feel right at home. A simple and affordable one page menu, which had a nice selection of paninis, entrees, salads and starters, made selection a breeze. I had the chicken curry and noodles, which had spices and hints of coconut. I will definitely visit again and highly recommend to others.",

   "Pleasantly pleased!  Space is small but warm and cozy with a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.  Food was delicious and German authentic.  I had marinated beef with egg noodles and cucumber salad and was blown away.  The beef was melt in your mouth out of this world and I could slice with my fork.  The egg noodles were spectacular for just being egg noodles and butter and the cucumber salad was just as good!  Good wine and beer selection. Oh, and the home made bread is excellent!",
   "The reviews did not disappoint. European pub ambience, delightful German beer and food. Sumptuous serving sizes as well. The sides were just as good as entrees",
   "First time dining here, and it was a great. Small place with limited seating however its cozy. They have a nice beer and wine selection. We had the schnitzel with a couple sides. The food was very authentic German. The meals are very reasonably priced. I definitely will back. Thanks Mike.",
   "From the moment I walked in the door, I knew I would love this place. Met with a warm welcome and a sense of pride for the culinary delights I was about to experience. Solid selection of German imports and wine to start. The menu is full of all the favorites and everything sounds delicious. The portions are overly generous and full of flavor. I would have no problem saying this is the best German food in Richmond, and probably the region.",
   "German food in the heart of Richmond! They have several different schnitzel options as well as other items (bratwurst, sausages, etc) that we found to be very good. The schnitzel can be pork, chicken, or veal depending on what you like. The only vegetarian main was a spatzel option that is basically \u201cGerman mac and cheese\u201d it is a lot of the same flavor by itself but also pretty delicious."

   "What a gem that Richmond has gained! From the cocktails to the appetizers and desserts to the entrees, I was beyond impressed with what Little Nickel brought to the table. The shining star of this place, besides the incredibly friendly staff, is the remarkable attention to detail in the restaurant decor. It was adorable, lux and weaved such a lovely vibe. You should just drop everything and go here now. You won\u2019t regret it!",
   "An eclectic restaurant in both style and substance, with a creative, tasty menu, fast and friendly service, and affordable prices (though drinks can add up quick). The menu seems to find inspiration from all corners of the world, and you're bound to find something tasty and inspiring here. The kids menu is a bit typical, which is probably a good thing because your kid will need to have a willingness to push their boundaries if they will be sharing a plate with you. The service is awesome. A 10 minute wait was really 2, and our waitress made sure my daughter had crayons and was overall just wonderfully nice. The food came out quick, was hot and delicious, and portions were giant. Everything we had was great. The restaurant is decorated with an island retro flair. You'll find lots to look at. The bar is particularly interesting. Overall, great!",
   "Little Nickel is unashamed of their love of Hawaiian shirts. You have to appreciate that!  Everything I tried was thoughtfully flavorful and delicious.  I\u2019m still thinking about the special from last night: fried risotto balls with a roasted pepper sauce.",
   "This definitely a spot to check out. It's warm  and quaint with an eclectic vibe. Although slightly pricey, they have fun drinks.  The food is delicious, the portions are generous and curiously better prices than the drinks in my opinion. The staff listens and caters to the patron's need. If you are looking for a new fun place to dine in Richmond, check them out."

The food comes extremely quick, except for a few things. We ordered some soup bones and the waitress told us they would take about 20 minutes for them to come out. I've been here a few times I've always enjoyed the food, and haven't had a bad experience yet. Would highly recommend!",

There is about 4 spots in front but if you don't get those wear walking shoes and don't park in the empty lot next door because they tow or charge $10",
   "This place has flavorful and unique foods. Everything is not only beautifully seasoned but also well presented. The meat eaters of the group strongly recommend the crispy pork belly appetizer, and we all loved the novelty of the bubble pancake.",
   "We moved here from Northern Va a year ago and tried Scots edition Peter Chang. So good!  The menu recently changed and there seems to be way fewer options, which is fine. I like that anything on the menu (just about) can be made gluten free. The restaurant interior decor is colorful, vibrant, and festive, and they also offer quick and easy take out if you prefer.",

Creamed spinach, potatoes au grotten,  2 small Caesar salads, 2 small steaks, a new York strip and lamb medallions, 4 cheesecake slices. Hardly enough food for 4 people. Worst of all the steaks and lamb were raw. Had to be cooked! We had to order pizza to feed everyone. Never again."

What I\u2019m here to spread the good word about, though, is THAT SPINACH PATTY. That was the best thing I\u2019ve ever put in my mouth! Perfectly chewy but crispy patty, filled with deliciously cooked spinach. The perfect balance of spices and texture. They KILLED IT. I want to eat 5 for every meal. I can\u2019t wait to go back. Last but not least, the hospitality is outstanding. I\u2019ve communicated with the owner over social media and have been astounded by the responsiveness, honesty, and gratitude. I am so happy to support this local spot.",

The young woman taking our \"to go\" order explained there was only one cook today and there would be a slight wait...others that were waiting longer than I, were offered free beverages.  She was courteous and responsive, nicely dressed, too.  The place was clean and neat.  The food was absolutely Amazing!!  I ordered a vegan dish called Honey Hennessy Stir Fry...sooo delicious. My friend had the Veggie Tacos, which looked out of this world scrumptious!!!  I will certainly be a regular \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17",

The stir fry, the salmon, the patties...everything I\u2019ve tried has been a hit.",

And it did not disappoint, the vegan Mac and the African fried spinach were a delicious experience and I hope these items will be a mainstay on the menu. I look forward to the next opportunity to visit True\u2019s Cultural Kitchen and allow my taste buds to be blessed again!",

I ordered the chicken biscuit and it was so delicious I had some sort of out of body experience where I forgot where I was and showed zero shame whilst licking my fingers in the middle of a crowded restaurant. It's the perfect blend of sweet, savory and spicy. It's heaven. The curry potatoes are perfectly spiced. The service is the perfect blend of attentive and leave you alone. The guys in the kitchen are insanely talented and focused. With good reason, the food coming out of it is perfection. 20/10 will totally go again!",
   "Fantastic, super cute, delicious. Had the bay Benedict and my eggs were perfect. Curry potatoes were also so good. Highly recommend",
   "It was little things that spoiled the visit. No one seemed to be in charge of greeting and seating guests. We were seated quickly after I asked.The Breakfast BLT was fine as were the curried potatoes. The The Chicken Biscuit was not. A thin piece of chicken stuck in the middle of lots of breading which was fried just shy of inedible.  Plus the honey pepper bacon was so heavy on the black pepper that I could still taste it 15 minutes later.  Two sandwiches and one glass of ice tea for $29 would feel a little high under normal circumstances. When one of the sandwiches was was as poor as this one, we weren't impressed. Nothing wrong with the vibe or the decor, but with as many choices as there are in RVA, it's not likely we'll be back.",
   "I had a $14 tab.  I had a $50 bill I needed to break.  It was a Friday night.  They couldn't break it.  I paid for my tab on my card and they gave me $25 back.  They basically stole $25 from me.  I didn't tip because of that. I'm never going back",
   "My friend and I went here on the 11th of March, around 8pm. We walk in, request a booth and the waiter (male, around 25 or so) immediately told us we couldn't have a booth because it was for dinners only. We didnt even get the chance to tell him we wanted food too. Naybe he got the impression we were there to drink and nothing else, that wasn't the case at all. No big deal, we said we'd sit on the bar side. He wouldn't even guide us to a table or tell us to sit where we wanted. The whole time his body language was very hostile, he was abrupt and rude. We ordered a drink but decided to go someplace else where the atmosphere wasn't so negative.\n\nMaybe he has person things going on at home, or maybe his previous guests were rude and he was projecting his anger. Regardless, the way he treated us was unacceptable. We won't be going back, there are ample amounts of restaurants in Carytown. You lost a potential regular customer that night."

   "So my order was given to someone else and I still can\u2019t understand because when you call in an order they take your name and also they charge way to many taxes to customers one in particular being the carry out tax which I feel since it is not an option to dine in at this time the customer shouldn\u2019t have to be taxed.

   "We have been to Alewife a handful of times without making a reservation. Talk about getting lucky multiple times with walking into a table that just emptied or an open spot at the bar!! If you want to experience this awesome restaurant and don't want to take any chances MAKE A RESERVATION. I say that because Alewife is no longer a secret and everyone knows the quality of this place. The dishes and cocktails are fresh, tasty and well prepared!! The staff is always on point and Alewife's menu and drink list has looked amazing every time we have gone in. The plating of Alewife's dishes are always beautifully done and the food tastes like perfection! We must return after this pandemic.",
   "We went to this cool restaurant on Easter Sunday last year and our meal was divine. The service was pleasant, efficient and not too over the top. Love the open concept and the ability to see the chef at work. I have missed being able to go into the restaurant and can\u2019t wait to return as soon as possible.",
   "Had a great meal here with my wife.  We had a table in the window, prompt & professional service & perfectly paced delivery.  The food was fantastic.  The menu is seasonal and always changing. They had seven non-alcoholic beverage options on their bar menu!",
   "I don't know where to start with Alewife. The reviews have been expansive in their praise for Chef Lee's latest project and we went with high expectations. After loving The Roosevelt and Southbound, we hoped Alewife would live up. As usual, Lee's creativity was the surprising thing. He's taken the menu in a different direction but the common thread with the other projects is that creativity. We had an array of appetizers and then somehow managed main dishes too, with some effort as we had already tried so many amazing things. It's so new but it looks like it will be a neighborhood gem for years to come. The recipe is fresh fresh fresh, Chesapeake, Virginia, fresh again, with a heavy dose of creative. 5 stars.",
   "First of all Tony and Andon at the bar were superb! Blown away! This place rocks! Great vibes. The food is amazing! The crab claws, tomato salad, shrimp and oysters were outstanding! One of the FEW 5 star reviews. Its takes a lot to get 5 real stars and Lee Gregory gets them all. The staff was great, food out of this world. Fried oysters to die for! Homemade hot sauce that stays with you. AMAZING!"

   "I attended a conference at the convention center fall 2019 and enjoyed dinner by myself at Parterre afterward. Of course, the Poe reference on the sidewalk chalkboard piqued my interest! It is comfortable and at the same time clean and sophisticated. I was greeted promptly for dinner. I have special dietary needs and they were able to advise me on what I could eat on the menu. The menu was a mix of modern and classics. I had a well seasoned shrimp and grits and iced tea. I would definitely eat here again if I'm in downtown Richmond for lunch or dinner :)",
   "Pretty setting and prices were good. The dish we ordered was not good. Sausage gravy was under seasoned. The tater tots were over seasoned (too salty). The egg was ordered over easy and came out overcooked and rubbery. The menu states two biscuits with the sausage gravy. It looked like one cut in half. Waitress was nice, and did take the egg off the bill.",
   "Good evening I just needed to say that Parterre Restaurant is absolutely excellent hospitality so friendly and very welcoming this morning I came in for coffee they were so sweet and kind I asked them about their menu as I was waiting they explain the menu you showed me the menu so I was able to come other times to explore their wonderful Hospitality with the other menus lunch and dinner looks like Excellent food on both of the they seem to have almost everything you would want to try and I had the opportunity to to experience the Hospitality with Celeste \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffeand Jess\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe absolutely warm and inviting Wonderful Hospitality I came back and had an appetizer and drink this morning I got veggie wrap it was actually made with tofu and it was delicious with vegetables peppers and onions and so forth and potatoes delicious please come and try them you will always come back the place is so cozy the decor is absolutely beautiful beautiful wood decoreven if it's a beautiful day you have outside patio which is absolutely beautiful as well just so inviting Love love love \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc9d\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",

The entire staff was warm and inviting. I was really impressed with the happy hour selections. What a great place.",
   "This place is awesome. I frequent this outstanding hotel the Lindon Row Inn that resides adjacent to this restaraunt.  The strawberry pound cake coffee is very good.  Admittedly I do not smell strawberries.  After plunging my epinephrine into my thigh due to an allergy to strawberries.... I tried the red wine.  Unfortunately grapes and strawberries reside in the same family.  Just kidding.  This place has great charm and street access close to broad street.  Very good food.  The fried chicken looks like a turkey dinner.  The staff is very friendly.  And we can all confess that this is what's missing from good service.  Combined with quality it's a refreshing experience.  No hipster douches or beef tartar here."

   "I went to Brunch for the first time today and LOVED my meal. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount and kinds of breakfast they offered. The space was lively and full of plants! The food was delicious; I had the Happy Herbivore bowl and a side of the seasonal fruit with a cup of coffee. I loved every bite! The staff was kind and helpful as well!",
   "Very good atmosphere. Sitting up towards the front where the sunlight can come in the skylight makes it even better. We of course had brunch and it was superb! I ordered the Waffle Flight because I couldn't pick just one of the types that they offered. I also had a side of Breakfast Sausage. The waffles were amazing and each came with a sample of the butter or syrup they are normally served with. This was definitely a pleasant twist on a typical breakfast staple. They even managed to revamp the typical sausage links. The breakfast sausage was clearly hand made ground sausage made into patties. If I am visiting Richmond again this place will definitely be one of my stops! Don't think twice. Just do it!",
   "Possibly the best breakfast in Richmond. I went with my wife for a breakfast in honor of a special day. Everything we ordered was delicious and well presented. I had the waffle flight and an espresso drink. The drink was well made with art and the waffles were well presented and delicious. It's a pretty popular place so you might have to wait 15 minutes or so to get a seat. The staff is friendly, well trained, and courteous. I definitely recommend this for any of your needs for a great breakfast.",
   "Killer pancakes and Monte Cristo, with a delightful atmosphere and wonderfully helpful and attentive staff. The mimosas are splendid and the food is delicious. Highly recommended, but do prepare to wait on a Sunday morning",
   "We went for brunch and I had a party of 7 and a hour wait and I would wait an hour again!!!! The service was awesome the food was amazing. Ms. Jacqueline helped our party get seated and Luke was our server. His recommendations for our meal was EVERYTHING! It was our first time in this wonderful resturant so we asked a million questions and he answered all with no problems. He told us his favorite dishes and he was spot on about everything. I plan on going back really soon and bringing more friends. This was such a wonderful dining experience!"

   "Experience: Home-run both time we were there. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nLocated in Jackson ward, close to the art infused neighborhoods along W Broad St, Restaurant Adarra feels like a house on the street that happens to serve food. It\u2019s presence highlighting the sense of community that you see in many places around Richmond (think Sub Rosa on Churchill).\n\nOn the eye: Being Basque-inspired meant some of the menus are tapa-like \u2014 in smaller bowls and plates that forms a picture of adventure, bringing delight for the diner. Colors are never dull nor added without purpose, most distinct would be the different peppers and beans.\n\nTaste: labeled as Modern European, it shakes off any potential \u201cNew American\u201d branding in its carefully curated dishes \u2014 crafting flavors that are unique to the region and yet carries with it an air of creativity. Many bringing out wonderful flavors without being stingy on the portion, allowing you to taste and fully enjoy each plate.\n\nDrinks: Cava is the \u201cchampagne\u201d of the land and it\u2019s presence is indicative of their priority \u2014 a drink menu focused on imports from Spain that draws a great authentic undertone for the meal.\n\nService: The service were casual yet confident. On both visits we were impressed by the knowledge of the server with both the food and drink menus. It\u2019s hard to miss their pride in the restaurant and all that it provides.\n\nDefinitely a gem in Richmond.",
   "Celebrated a birthday dinner on a Saturday night.  Our meal was excellent, more enjoyable while sharing.  Service was slightly under expectations, and just shy of attentive.  It took a good 10 minutes before a server approached us for drink orders and also rambled unintelligibly though the specials, my partner had to ask for a refill of a beverage twice, and it was noticeable that regular patrons received a ton of attention but the rest of us not so much.  But generally, we had a good experience.",
   "We had an excellent dinner at Restaurant Adarra. The menu is made up of small plates that can be shared. This is great as it allows you to try multiple things from the menu. We had a group of four and got to sample a pretty good portion of the dishes. The flavors were amazing and everything was pretty good. The skate and rabbit really stood out in particular.\n\nWhile I was extremely pleased with the food, the cocktails were possibly even more impressive. The Little Italy was my favorite, by far, but I would highly recommend talking to the bartender about what kinds of things you like and then letting him come up with a concoction based upon those preferences. I tried a few different things and liked them all. the bartender was very knowledgeable and seemed to be able to get a good feel of what I would enjoy.\n\nThe restaurant is very small, so reservations might be hard to come by, especially on short notice. This isn't usually an issue for us as we enjoy sitting at the bar. However, the night we were there, they were giving out the corner section of the bar as a reservation. This really cuts down on the number of bar seats available for walk-ups and was an unwelcome surprise. Definitely not a deal-breaker, but something to be aware of if you can't get a reservation and it looks like there might be space at the bar.\n\nOverall, we had a great time and would definitely return.",
   "Super food, great decor and atmosphere. Staff and owners were friendly and great. One of the best in Richmond. Can\u2019t recommend enough! Will be back for sure.",
   "Chef Doetzer never disappoints. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Make sure to ask for the perfect wine for pairing"

The chef cooked an awesome non menu item special for her and it was incredible.   Everyone else ordered from the menu and the food did not disappoint.  Live tiki lounge music was great and relaxing.  Great time!",
   "Fantastic cocktails and fancy menu. Hip space up front but the back room (which may be good for a small party) doesn\u2019t have the same vibe - feels a bit stuffier and more old fashioned than the vibrant front area. Got the heirloom tomato salad and PayPal salad - both lacked greens. Probably overlooked that on the menu but it was a bit unexpected. Great interior design and service was pretty good.",
   "If I could give 6 stars  I would. The food was fantastic; the servers were amazing. In addition, I have multiple food allergies (soy, dairy & gluten). When I arrived, I told them the allergies. When I sat down, they brought over a customized menu which included the chefs adaptations to remove any of my allergens. No restaurant has ever been able to customize so many menu items. I was in food heaven!  An unquestionably delicious meal.",
   "Oh my! There are no words to describe the culinary genius that is PERCH but I will try. We had the whole fish and the special, rock fish. The flavors were amazing, they just exploded on your tongue! The decor is very pleasing to the eye and it compliments the type of food beautifully. My advice is to make time and eat at PERCH! We are praying that Perch will expand and come to Charlotte. Until then we will have to visit Richmond more often!",
   "Each time I come to Perch, the experience amazes me. The first time we sat at the chefs table and were treated to several things to try, a lovely conversation with the chef and the folks working in the kitchen, and were served amazing food (the duck pizza, calamari, oysters were all incredible). The second time was for a friends birthday and again, the chef and staff treated us like we were royalty. They gave my friends a tour (I was late) and gave them some things to try, the service was spot on, refills without asking, never having to wait for our wait staff.  Then we were served a couple desserts for our friends birthday which were absolutely amazing. I can't get enough of this place. It's worth a visit or 10. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  I wish more restaurants would take note from how Perch does business."

   "Picked up lunch this week. Super friendly staff (Jaymie and Justin) quickly had my order perfect and the cold crowler ready to go. Definitely recommend the Beef n cheddar with wedges! That cheese sauce was da bomb! Got the Korean and dry rub wings; both were delicious. Love the draft list! Can\u2019t wait to go back! New fave spot!",
   "Great neighborhood kind of place with a variety of beers, wines, and mixed drinks. They have a kind-of bipolar menu with a $22 entree (which was very tasty), a couple of other entrees, then it drops to burgers (which I have not tried but looked delicious). I think this place is trying to find out who they are and will get there. My recommendation -- give it a try."

It\u2019s a fancy restaurant and it was hard to chose from their tasty-sounding menu, but we ended up getting the crab Benedict and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e French toast.\n\nThe crab Benedict came with hash browns and fruit, and the French toast came with strawberries and whipped cream on top. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e French toast was more like a pound cake though it made it more unique\u2014 it could function more as a dessert than an entree.\n\nCrab Benedict had only a complete pieces of shell that I noticed, and the poached eggs on top we\u2019re good. We also got some Rose tea (which had a fancy-sounding name). It was aromatic yet quite strong. \n\nSince we \u2018checked-in\u2019 using Yelp, we got two free truffle pieces. It is worth trying their brunch as they have some unique and good tasting menu items to choose from.",
   "I am sorry guys I was so immersed in the food experience that I forgot to take any pictures... but this place does not need pictures to be described. Chez Foushee is by far one of my favorite places in Richmond. It wasn't just about the drinks and food but an overall amazing experience with the faint fragrance of lillies, interesting conversation with the bar tender, the beautifully decorated place and most importantly a perfectly cooked duck breast paired with the right wine.",

The sampler platter is a filling way to try it all!

Street parking is plentiful; do be aware the only bathroom is downstairs and not wheelchair accessible.",

   "Food was delicious. So nice to see things that you don't find at other restaurants. For example, rabbit. Service was great. And it was great to see them taking extra care in cleaning during this trying time. Like cleaning the door handle at least 3 times while we were there for dinner.",
   "Cozy place with very good food. If I remember correctly, the corkage fee was only $20. I love bringing my own wine to restaurants when I can. The charcuterie board was out of this world. Our server was delightful. I wish I could remember her name. \n\nTry to sit away from the door in the winter. It\u2019s cold with a big draft when the door opens.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the menu changes often so if you find a dish you love (and you likely will) it may not be offered the next time you\u2019re there.",
   "Went with my girlfriend during Richmond restaurant week. The restaurant has an interesting aesthetic. It feels like an upscale bar/pub because of the small size. Service was terrific. They serve three course meals here and I had the Smoked Sweet Potato, Eggplant Schnitzel, and Apple Strudel. The Schnitzel was particularly delicious and was the highlight of the evening. Would recommend to others.",
   "This is a fascinating place to eat! I had the chicken schnitzel Which is kind of like a country fried steak with gravy and fried eggs on duck fat fried potatoes underneath! It was a decadent brunch unlike any I have had!",
   "Absolutely delightful brunch. Perfect dishes to share excellent mix of cocktails and beer.  Very authentic take on German and euro dining and a comfortable space. The cheese spaetzle with egg carried me back to my youth. Missed the pretzels but I'm sure they are delicious as well."

   "This is my third time dining at The Daily. I always sit at the bar. I always get the fried calamari and a drink. Both have been amazing each time. \n\nThe bartenders are always pleasant and well-informed about the menu, dietary restrictions, and available substitutions. They go out of their way to make me feel welcome and appreciated. That means a lot. That means that they care about their customer's experience.\n\nGo here for dinner, lunch or brunch. You'll love it!",
   "Delicious food but pretty darn pricey.\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Particularly because of cost & our service wasn\u2019t great. We waited nearly an hour after ordering our food. Something definitely went awry but our waitress never said anything about it. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t either so, maybe that\u2019s our fault. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nUnsure if I\u2019ll go back even though it tasted good, just not sure that it\u2019s really worth it for me.\nIf you like \u201cfiner things\u201d and spending $$ then def hit this place up! You\u2019ll probably like it better than I did. \n*Sandwiches are def the best bang for your buck\n**Banana bread is also surprisingly delicious (my friend ordered it)",
   "Hubby brought me brunch @ The Daily. Yum. The restaurant has a trendy vibe, the front of the house is decorated in a cool mix of organic meets clean lines. The  food came out hot. Our service was good. The back of the house was running smoothly as it did not take a long time to get our food.  My favorite part of the restaurant having enough room to have a private conversation in public.",
   "The Daily Kitchen & Bar was a great experience. The organic food they serve here is delicious. The lime cilantro sauce was fantastic and made my spicy chicken avocado bowl, also was a good dip for the fried. Overall I will definitely go again to enjoy more of the delicious meals.",
   "It's a little on the loud side when they are busy. Love the health options. Service was good. Food was just alright. But I didn't feel it was over priced."

   "Delicious food, family style, authentic experience! Prices are fair for the quality and location. Highly recommend \u201call 6\u201d vegetable options with one or two meats for a table of 4. We were stuffed! Can\u2019t wait to come back!",
   "Good food with great taste and quality. A single entree with an extra side should be good for two. Especially loved their minced chicken dish",
   "Incredible. My wife and I have now eaten here around 10 times. Each time, we worry it won\u2019t live up to how good it was previously. Each time, it\u2019s as good or better. Quickly becoming my favorite place in the city. \n\nIf you are unsure of what to order, do a specialty platter and ask for recommendations. You can\u2019t go wrong.",
   "Went there for my birthday. Food was amazing. Service was great. We had a party of 9, and even with a large group, everything went really smooth. Would highly suggest trying a little bit of everything. We did!"

   "This was our first night out after having our daughter so we were very excited.  When we arrived a waitress helped us since the hostess (short haired female) was on the phone.  She attempted to sit us next to a large party so we asked if a booth was available. As she was looking the hostess was rudely shaking her head no and putting her hand in the air as if we were bothering her.  We finally just accepted the table by the party.  The food was average. Not bad, but nothing special.  Since we rarely go out we got drinks, apps, dinner, and dessert.  We were at the table approximately an hour and I had just paid my bill (maybe 5 minutes) before the hostess came over and said we needed to leave because she needed the table. This was just not a pleasant experience and considering we are blessed with multiple great restaurants all around Richmond we will not be heading back.  Go spend your money somewhere else.  Like Azzuro right next door.",
   "Read until the end \u2014 Friendly service, and the food was OK. Though, there are two single occupancy restrooms. One of which has an \u201cout of order\u201d sign taped to the door. Unfortunately, this sign is misleading. The restroom works fine, the employees are just \nusing it as their own private restroom..Smh.",
   "Wasn't great, wasn't bad, just kind of mediocre.\nThere's no list of their draft beers, so you have to rely on the handwritten chalkboard on the wall (like you would find at a dive bar). I picked my beer off of the chalkboard, and my wife picked her wine off of the (printed) wine menu. They were out of both (so back to the chalkboard for me). Not a big deal, but having an accurate beverage listing on a Saturday night should be a given. The food was good, but that's about it (our waitress was great, I must add).\nMaybe I'll try again, but not somewhere I'd go out of my way to eat or recommend.",
   "This is the absolute worst experience I have ever encountered with a restaurant. I made a reservation for my family on Christmas Eve at 3:30 pm. When I got to the restaurant, we were informed that this was impossible as they closed at 3 pm. When I went to show them the confirmation, my Open Table said that it was for December 26 at the same time. They were extremely rude about it, basically shoving us out the door and telling us better luck next time. I figured it must have been my mistake, so I let it be and thankfully found another last minute reservation elsewhere. As you can see in my email confirmations, my reservation was originally for when I thought, but changed late the night before without so much as a phone call. I have been a host at many restaurants that use the same Open Table system and know it is not possible to completely move a reservation on the restaurant end without changing the amount of people. If they had simply called to let us know that they were closing early, rather than being sneaky, rude and unaccommodating leaving my family with no Christmas Eve reservations as far as they knew, that would have been much preferred. Even if this was my fault, which as the email confirmations show it was not, the absolute snottiness to my family was absurd. Due to this experience, I will not be returning to this restaurant, nor recommending it to anyone I know. If it were possible to post this with zero stars, that is what I would give them and their staff.",
   "Visited this restaurant for a friend's birthday celebration. I arrived late and it took a very long time to be waited on.  It was a Monday evening and the place wasn't extremely packed but it appeared the waiter was also the server and bartender for the evening. I didn't find anything I was thrilled about on the menu and the prices were very expensive, so I just opted for a sangria. My friends ordered calamari for an appetizer which was pretty good, but there were no raves for their individual entrees.  One friend ordered what she thought was a loaded baked potato which came out as loaded mashed potatoes instead another friend had some type of pesto meatball which she was disappointed with as well.  The gratuity was already included with the tab.  Overall the space was a little tight inside, it had a nice eccentric atmosphere but I would not personally choose to visit again."

   "Hands down, absolutely the best service in RVS extremely welcoming from start to finish, literally every single member of the staff provided outstanding customer service. Drinks were good (varied selection), appetizers, entrees, and dessert were delicious. We'd tried a few times over the last 2 months to get in, but it just hadn't worked out, it was most certainly worth the wait! Reservations are definitely recommended, gets busy very quickly during peak hours.",
   "All four of us loved Gersi.  Great drinks (not cheap) and an excellent menu with some entrees priced in the mid teens.   Risotto entree was great,  friend said the sea bass was the best he'd had.  Same story with the Bolognese and linguini with clams.  Place was packed and loud,  which seemed right for this Brooklyn based restaurant.  We'll be back for sure!",
   "Great cozy spot with amazing Italian food - homemade pasta is so delicious - all The staff were very attentive and knowledgeable and super friendly we would totally go back here again and recommend all our friends to go out here for a great dinner in the fan.  so glad this place has come to our neighborhood!",
   "We came on a Saturday night and though we quickly realized we should have made a reservation, we decided that the 1-1.5 hour wait was worth it and we would wait. We waited and waited and checked back an hour and 45 min later (they said they\u2019d call and they never did to update us) only to be told we still had another 20-30 minutes and they couldn\u2019t guarantee us a spot because they \u201conly seat reservations\u201d. After explaining to the hostess and who appeared to be a manager that I understand they can\u2019t predict timing of parties leaving, it would have been nice to know they seat reservations and they book out 2 days ahead so the likelihood of getting a table before 9 pm was almost zero. At this point it was 8:50 pm and we left to go to Mama Zu\u2019s which has never left us disappointed and we got in immediately. I\u2019m all for reservations but it should be made clear that they book their restaurant out with reservations instead of leaving tables for walk-ins. This situation would have been much better and I honestly wouldn\u2019t write the review if it wasn\u2019t for the way the manager talked to me and was incredibly rude talking to me like I was dumb and should be grateful they\u2019d eventually seat us. Like you\u2019re less than the people who made reservations. If that\u2019s how you want to do business I\u2019m fine with spending my money elsewhere. Also my friend wrote a review for this place and we had a terrible experience back in early November and they said they\u2019d reimburse us for the food because of how awful the time was there and they never did which is incredibly annoying to be promised something by a business and then never follow through. Don\u2019t come here without a reservation. It\u2019s a waste of time and they\u2019re rude. Maybe Gersi should explain that reservations are the only option on the weekend. That\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t tell us we\u2019ll get a table you can\u2019t guarantee, and don\u2019t be rude.",
   "Beautiful atmosphere and amazing food! Great place for a romantic evening. Will definitely come back"

   "We celebrated my son's birthday there tonight. Great food and a great time. Our waiter Jesse gave us wonderful service and Nick (manager) made sure my son's night was special!",
   "the first time I was here was in 2001 and remembered it to be the best tasting pizza ever. What stuck out was the crust. The texture and the flavor. I have always talked about it through the years. I almost never find myself in Richmond but have always dreamt of going there when I was in Richmond. After waiting for many years, decided to make a special trip out there since I had a complete free day with no commitments. Taking advantage of this rarity I drove the 2 hours to try it. My waitress Grace was very friendly and suggestive of pies to try. Did the Smokehouse and the Chesapeake and both were FANTASTIC! It still hold the record of my most favorite pizza place",
   "Great pizza, love the crust! Haven't had one I didn't like. Salads good too.",
   "My 2nd time here and I can only say it is perfect! Pizza was delicious and 1 slice is so big I had to take half of it home. Finding a parking spot can be a bit tricky, but once you solve that, the experience is worth it. Server was a brand new employee but did a great job. When done eating, you can take advantage of their great location and walk to Main Station, Farmers Market and many other wonderful places around. Delicious Pizza, good service, great price. 5 Stars indeed! Thanks!",
   "Well made pizza. We liked the thin crust more than the regular. We had the crab with white sauce & brisket with bbq sauce pizzas. Unique flavors done well. We ordered mediums- they were definitely bigger than typical individual sized pizzas but seemed little smaller than a typical medium size."
