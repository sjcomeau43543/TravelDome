   "I have not been since a school field trip probably in 2010. I took a kid who I was nannying for (he was not looking forward to it) . Guess what, HE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME AND SO DID I! And for the 2 of us, he a kid 6-18 Yrs old and me an adult 18+ it was $5.. that's it!! Ask for the scavenger hunt is you go!! Total fun",
   "Its very affordable & a good place to take children. The exhibits are interesting, informative & very focused on Maine day to day life of regular ppl which sometimes gets lost when we only talk about leaders & big events. The animal exhibit is a big hit with the children &  there are a number of good programs presented to engage young kids.  The parking can be good but it depends on the day if the legislature is in session you'll want to allow time to find a space.",
   "This is an incredible museum and an outstanding value. My wife and I had 2 hours to see the entire museum and it wasn't enough! If you are a history buff and especially enjoy Maine history, you will NOT be disappointed.",
   "My son loves it. It is affordable. The staff have been welcoming. Still exploring the programs.",
   "We went to the Maine State Museum on a field trip. We had two sessions with workers from the museum that were outstanding! They answered questions and gave lots of info to our students. They did a great job!!"

   "Wide open green spaces with a great view of the Capitol, especially at sunup/sundown and at night with the Capitol building all lit up. Easy to access and always very clean. Sometimes can be a bit noisy due to its location, but it\u2019s large enough that most spots aren\u2019t loud enough to spoil the day. Great spot for family photos or photographers looking for an easy but engaging location.",
   "Lovely  walking pathways through the park. Lots of green area for picnics.",
   "Peaceful and quiet, cool under the trees. Where the rains had not drained well, they had formed a very shallow pond near us, where ducks played and made us smile. \nThe Maine Vietnam War Memorial stands here, too, somber and solemn.",
   "Walk each day there,so pretty and enjoy the fresh air and it's not that crowded",
   "The park is beautiful with large grassy areas and plenty of shade trees, tables, and benches. There is a playground across the street thats great for kids too."

   "Great place to take a walk with friends and family or bring the pet for a wilderness jog. Have always had a blast here and always get to enjoy seeing some wildlife no matter what time of the year it may be. There are snow shoe trails and also cross country skiing trails. The as arboretum does unfortunately close at dark, which kills the idea of a night hike in the woods but still a very cool place to visit . Highly recommended",
   "They also have rooms for rent for meetings.  Lovely gardens lots of things to look at. Great place to bring kids.",
   "Very beautiful, quiet, well maintained trails. Great place to walk or run. Several trails for just a quick stroll or a longer expedition. Several sitting areas for a quick rest or a picnic lunch. The art work throughout is breathtaking. A great place for one or the whole family.",
   "One of my favorite places to go walking. A variety of trails in the shady woods and around open fields of wildflowers. There are unique and fascinating sculptures to enjoy along the paths. Different habitats to explore from a woodland pond to a hillside rock garden and a stroll through the hosta garden. I particularly enjoy the groves of trees clustered by species, stone benches are available to rest in their shade.",
   "Fabulous resource.   The grounds offer multiple well-marked hiking trails for walking,  snowshoeing or cross-country skiing.  Leashed dogs are welcome and unique statues enliven the open spaces.  Beautiful even in the winter."

   "Pretty nice place to visit. I love history so, nice to see an old trading post. Pretty small but they usually were. Nice park about a 5 minute or less walk away. Great for kids as well a nice big playground at the park. Saw some people just reading so nice quiet place as well.",
   "A great place full of history that comes to life! The oldest still in use colonial building in the USA, and home to a number of historical items. A place where everyone of all ages can enjoy a great look back in time, and learn a great deal about how people lived in the colonies that became the United States. From how they made clothes and grew food, to tools and living spaces, as well as the weapons they used to defend themselves in battle. This is an awesome experience that I would highly recommend to all!! I enjoyed being there as a chaperone for my daughter's second grade class field trip, and I hope to go back again this Summer to check out more of what they have at this amazing how e of history! Located right on the Kennebec River in Augusta Maine, and easy to get into from the main thorough fares. Well worth the price of admission, currently 10.00$ for adults, stop by if you can and be ready to learn!",
   "Tour guide was so informative. Historic spot that was important to the areas success.",
   "Interesting looking little fort, but visitors to the area are asked to pay an exorbitant fee for entrance. $10 per adult, $6 per child, to essentially step inside the fence and look in a single building. \n\nMeanwhile, a couple of blocks up the road you can visit the 4 story Maine Museum and see hours worth of exhibits for a tiny fraction of the price.\n\nIt's unfortunate. Because if they had asked for $2-3 we'd have paid it to support the upkeep even though we'd have only spent 15 minutes here. As is, I'm sure they're turning away most visitors with the outrageous prices. \n\nI'm sure that's the way they want it...",
   "Fantastic tour! Ms Arnold was a wonderful guide. Worth visiting if you are in the area."

Thank you to the owners for the amazing job you do in caring for the animals and the wonderful staff u hire. Never realized how much money and work this family does because they love animals. If anyone is looking for an organization to make a donation to seriously come check out this place. The Big cats will steal your hearts!",

There's even some fowl just strolling around with you! \nMore exotic cats than I have ever seen in one place. You can see they are expanding to include more as well. Staff were friendly and helpful, gift shop available at the end of the park. Definitely worth a visit (or three!).",
   "It was under construction but what a wonderful surprise this little place was to us. We will be regulars every year to support this rescue zoo. I loved the black bear, tigers, lions, black panther, mountain lion,. Bob cat, camel, farm animals (who you feed if you want), and the ducks that follow you but are nice.",

I think you could really see everything in the museum in about 3 hours. Parking is plentiful and there is a small gift store and Cafe on site. Definitely recommended!",
   "Outstanding, free to the public, museum. Rather than hocking art donations like Harvard does, Colby builds additions. Spacious and beautifully curated. Has hundreds of Whistler works. Several artists donate their work, e.g. Alex Katz. Has a small coffee and snack shop. I love this museum, and visit every time I'm in Maine. I could go on and on with praise.

   "We all love this place and you can rent the outdoor area for friend and family gatherings which has a bbq, power, and a sink. Warm water and a small beach with restrooms and camping available nearby.",
   "A wonderful state park. Only thing is that there is a limited amount of parking. So it's advised to get here early."

   "This was a really fun last minute idea.  The tickets are $20 each and if you buy online there is a small fee but it is totally worth it.\n\nMy son loved the train ride.  He never sits still but once the train started going he was all into it.\n\nAfter the train ride you wan walk around through the little village into all the buildings and there is something set up all around.  From making an ornament to sitting on the big old fire truck (Aldens favorite).",
   "Update your website to reflect closed...DROVE WHOLE WAY for nothing.",
   "I absolutely love the place, I go there at least once a year and last time I went I got to see the trains up close and I was absolutely in awe. The only thing I don\u2019t really like is that the loop is kinda short and there aren\u2019t any signs saying \u201cemployees only\u201d or \u201cstay out\u201d so I\u2019m nervous that I\u2019ll be looking around and end up going somewhere I\u2019m not supposed to go to",
   "What a great place. Was thinking it was just going to be a few barbs with trains to look at but was completely amazed at them having a whole historic village, massive car collection, model train village as well as trains and a train ride set in beautiful grounds. Spent an easy 3 hours here. Staff incredibly friendly too.",
   "It's small. It's cute. It is not an original railroad line, but original pieces. There are some random collections. The Salt and Pepper house is one that is random. My son loves the train.  Your train ticket is good for the whole day. The train runs every hour."

   "So the lights were as beautiful as ever. The lights get 5 stars. However, it was missing a few steps in the family friendly category this year. In the past we have enjoyed the campfires and the kettle corn, both of which were missing.  Hopefully all the money that this event brings in is not going to be diminished by taking a bunch of shortcuts.",
   "Pack a lunch, a big lunch, loads of snacks and come on out here for the entire day.  This place is outstanding when it comes to value, entertainment, education and nature.  This is one of the most beautiful gardens I\u2019ve been to and a must see for anyone coming to Maine.  \n\nChildren\u2019s area is huge and they can easily spend an hour plus playing there.  The hiking trails are fantastic and you\u2019ll definitely earn a big lunch.",
   "Such a holiday delight, GO ! See IT !  \nI can't  say enough . . .  walk around the acres of holiday lights strung all over the trees, bushes, and water bridges at the Botanical Gardens in Booth Bay, Maine.\n\nThe cost was $16 for adults, and kids about $9 each for entrance into the Botanical Gardens. You need to buy your tickets ahead of time . . .  online works.  I believe the holiday lights are up 2 weeks before Thanksgiving to New Years. Over that 6 week period, you can buy tickets for the 4 pm time slot, or the 6 pm time slot. But check out the website for details. \n\nWatch the weather, and temperatures! It was cold the night we went, temps. in the teens with wind gusts up to 25 mph. Dress with all the trimmings, for your head, hands, and feet! There were 600,000 lights this year! FANTASTIC! \n\nThe best news, try the hot chocolate stations! They take cash or credit. They offer a few delightful flavors, I highly recommend  the butter rum or peppermint! \nEnjoy the Best hot chocolate  ever . . . as you walk around and see the best MAINE  light display ever!",
   "We went on Christmas night and we were not disappointed.  Very creatively designed.  Music played as we walked through the gardens. The fairy houses are so detailed and the train village is impressive.   We can't say enough about how beautifully lit the gardens are.  This is a must see for the entire family!"

There you will find a tiny cave placed on the floor for the kids. Whew! After that exhausting adventure, you'll have seen everything! Still, all jokes aside, preserving the habitats for these amazing creatures is a noble cause, and they clearly love what they do, so get thee in there and donate!",

I love that everything that is on site is open for you to go and peak in and check out if you want to, just be careful. They have a lovely gift shop which has more than just souvenir items also has some great vintage railroad books for sale. Lovely ride in your choice of several different types of car. Got to love the smell of steam and cinders....(ps...don't wear white clothing!)",

Everyone who works there is friendly and knowledgeable and will take the time to answer any question you may have.  On weekends there is train ride using the authentic, restored locomotives and cars.",
   "Friendly people, a lot of fun for the kids. Nice little gift shop with used books (probably donated) some toy trains and hats for the kids, and other odds and ends. \n\nAnother building with some model trains running for kids to see. \n\nThe ride is not a long one but still fun for the kids. Train and  traincar was beauty inside and out",
   "This museum is unique, if you love trains,this is a must go bucket list place. They are rebuilding this railroad left for dead in the 1930s , on its original right of way, many pieces of the original railroad have been restored to operation and others replicated,take a trip back to the mid teens,Gman."

You can climb down to a tiny little \"beach\". The history is remarkable. The issue, and reason why my rating is so low is because the shear amount of dog waste. We saw a couple of locals allowing their dogs to do their free range pooping, without a clean-up in sight. It is so extreme heading to the picnic tables, that we couldn't walk two steps without having to try to miss piles (and failing). As the grass grows and hides the poop, I can't imagine how many kids are going to be sitting in/rolling in this potential hazard. I've lived in Maine my entire life and I've never seen an area with so much dog waste.",

Little less that 1 mile into a gorgeous picnic area, under a shelter, in a meadow on the river. There's also a composting toilet there that's in a shelter.

Trails are perfectly groomed, mountain isn't too small, price is amazing and you can visit on your snowmobile, it is right before the end of the whistle stop trail on the left hand side. They do use T bar lifts and if you never used one do not at any point try and put pressure on them as they pull you only, if you try and sit then your bum will be in the snow! Overall I am very happy I found this place and can't wait to go back, if your a local you should be here weekly if not sooner! I do hope they put a snowmobile trail into the parking lot so your not just on the side of the trail.",

   "Incredible structure,  great walk.  If it's windy plan carefully.  You'll feel every bit of the 4300 ft walk.  Not recommended for dogs. Too many crevasses for their poor paws to catch",
   "I would rate this lighthouse experience higher, but I have not had the opportunity  to go inside this historic structure for a tour yet? \n\nAs a former history teacher, I look forward to completing  this adventure.  At this time I can share part of this experience   . . . \n\nThis lighthouse project was first started in the 1880's. Over time money was provided to construct a long jetty of rocks spanning 7/8 of a mile, by the U.S. Army Corp.  Folks can walk out with their kids ( over 5 or 6 years of age). Be careful, the cracks between the rocks are often over 12 inches wide, so little children need their parent's help.  When you arrive at the lighthouse, the building itself is usually closed, but you can walk around the building  and take photos.  \n\nThere's  no cost. No restrooms. No tour guides.   But it's  a nice walk, with a view of Rockland harbor. Hopefully I can arrange an inside tour, to enjoy the full experience and share with others.",
   "What a lovely place, esp. loved the stone walkway to the lighthouse!",
   "Wonderful walk down the breakwater (literally a long row of car-sized hunks of granite) out to the lighthouse. They even have a small floating dock off to the side where you can get the perfectly angled picture of the lighthouse.",
   "Beautiful walk to the lighthouse! The hottest day of the summer, 100 degree temps with the humidity, but we were fine. I had sandals on, just be careful of the big gaps between the rocks. Scenery is gorgeous - sail boats, people fishing & dog friendly. Highly recommend! \u2661\u2661"

   "Fort Knox: This place is really cool and fun to go walk around. It isn't really wheel chair friendly but there are some place you can visit while on a wheel chair. Inside the fort there is tons of cool tunnels and different rooms that are fun to explore. There are some interesting stories here as well. They offer a whole bunch of different events here that are worth checking out. This place is pretty active and offer lots of space for big groups of people to visit. When you come here with some of your friends, it is worth playing hide and seek here.",
   "Love this historical place. They hold great events throughout the year and we especially love Fright at the Fort. They put on a spooky fun and safe show.  Beautiful view of Bucksport. Can visit this place regularly and it's always enjoyable.",
   "Incredible place to visit. The fort is well preserved and the bridge and lighthouse tower are amazing. Unfortunately the tower was closed when we were there. Check ahead before you go to ensure it's open.",
   "I was amazed at the bridge construction using huge cables extremely large granite support structures one of which you can enter and take an elevator to the top observation deck. The structure is clean and has excellent workmanship though out. The structure is made from Maine granite and has an amazing carving in the floor outside the entrance with the state logo. The elevator to the top was clean, new, large and very fast and smooth ride. The other attraction in the park is Fort Knox which again made with Maine granite. This is must see and very well preserved fort. The workmanship again is amazing and very strong structure. The park is well landscaped and kept up.",
   "This place is really amazing and only $8!  The towers are incredible and dizzying just to look at from the ground.  Fort Knox was also impressive.  You can walk through the whole place on your own and imagine what life must have been like for the soldiers back in the day.  I highly recommend this site for one of your vacation stops."

   "This is a nice little stop in New England. Great gift shop, nice educational museum. We stopped in 20 years ago on our honeymoon and we're delighted to see it still has it's charm!",
   "Free Admission during January.  Locals and visitors from away can see the core exhibits at no cost. Once you've done that, you'll want to plan a visit during warmer weather so that you can explore the outside exhibits and take a boat cruise. This past fall, I took the lighthouse cruise and I highly recommend it. \n\nThis is a family friendly museum that is easily handicapped accessible. I included some lighthouse tour pictures from the fall.",
   "Wow, this is a gem of a find. We enjoyed it and could have stayed longer. We had three great tour guides. David gave us an overview of the whole facility. He did not miss a beat. He got us in and out as predicted. He was sensitive to the time. We had to make the boat tour and safely did. \nBen was our guide on the tour boat. He showed us the extensive history of the Bath, ME. Area, such as the Bath Iron Works, the Kennebec River, and light houses. He was full of knowledge. Irene was our guide for the Donnell House.",
   "Great pieces of history.  Love learning about our heritage. They had some cool things that allowed the kids to get some hands on learning. Overall great experience.",
   "AMAZING CREW. WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.    My wife and I discovered this place accidentally. We entered the facility hoping to see some cool town history when we discovered the crew of artisans building a vintage wood schooner. Then the crew of docents guided us around the place and introduced us to the men and women taking on the amazing task. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Thanks folks."

   "A great place to learn with very reasonable rates. The employees seem to be understanding of beginners and I didn\u2019t feel judged when I fell trying to get off the chairlift. The rentals are phenomenal: very fast to get you sized and no shortage of any equipment or sizes.",
   "Best first time experience ever! I was so terrified! But my Ski instructor and the people who were there was extremely helpful! They were do nice from even helping me put my ski gear on! I would go back and take my kids there too!",
   "Wonderful mountain for families and beginners, or if you haven't skied in a long time and need a less intimidating place to get back into the groove. Or if you just want to be outside and get some runs in! Note that more intermediate to advanced skiers will likely feel this mountain is much too small. Reasonably priced given that it's a small mountain.",
   "Really small ski resort that is great for absolute beginners. If you want to take your child skiing/riding and they are first time beginners, this is the place! There is a very short and not steep \"bunny\" hill with a very short magic carpet/surface lift. It is perfect for a beginner to ride the carpet, and point their skis down the hill. It is not long enough or steep enough for them to pick up any real speed so it's perfect for learning the basics. I wouldn't recommend it for adults who want to learn snowboarding, because the bunny hill really isn't big enough for an adult to pick up snowboard. Go to a mountain with a regular size bunny hill for that. But it's perfect for kids! Then there are 2 chair lifts that access green trails.  The shorter chair lift (1) is great for beginners. And chair 2, which is longer, also can take you to some green trails, and some short/easy blue trails.",
   "It is an amazing place!! My friend and I went snow tubing a few days ago. The guys were nice and they were overall fun and funny. I recommend this place to a lot of people. And I promised one of the guys a review. Sooo here u go. And I got to get him pour a shovel of snow on my friend. He missed and she laughed. I love this place and keep it like it is and it will be the perfect place!!!!!"

   "WOW! This church is HUGE. It is easily seen from Auburn into Lewiston. Once one walks to it, the size of the Church dwarfs even the tallest person. The most ornate stone work is in the front of the building, the original church was made out of Bricks and is attached to the stone church at the back. (Please see photos, it will make sense then.) The beautiful stone work portion has a 'plaque' of the date of completion. The Brick Church at the back has a late 1800 date above the door. It was really nice to walk from Auburn to Lewiston, it got my kid off the video games for a few hours. We even found a little store on the way back to buy drinks and a comic store as we were taking our time and debating if we should go the the memorial park. Good time and I hope to do it again!",
   "A beautiful place.  2nd largest in New England, begun build in 30s. Pipe organ sounds great! Check online schedule for free performances.",
   "Just like any other Catholic Church. However the priest does have a very caring attitude.  Very friendly. He also has a flair for putting on a show in his entrance.",
   "Praise God for this beautiful Cathedral that is vibrant in faith and holiness!",
   "I've looked all over for a church that offers the Tridentine Latin Mass, and this beautiful basilica offers the Latin at 8:30 am every Sunday according to their website. The Catholic churches in my area do not offer the sacred and traditional Latin Mass, which, the embrace of traditionalism will be the future of Roman Catholicism come hell or high water. Beautiful place of worship."

   "South End Dog Park in Bath, Maine is one of our favorite places. Fully fenced in on three sides and the ocean adding it's own kind of fencing make it good safe fun.\nThere is a nice path circling the park for walking while the pups run and play and a big pier with benches to sit and watch the water too. A circulating fountain provides fresh water and there are bags for clean up and waste collection containers too. \nIt has it all and makes a walk, bark, run or frolic in the park something both you and your dog will both enjoy!"

   "Beautiful group of trails not too far off the beaten path. Just minutes from the bustle of Freeport shopping you can find some wilderness solitude. Trails are ready to access in all seasons and well maintained. All the trails are easy and short but offer beautiful views. There are many programs available to new and experienced hikers alike, including group hikes and winter gear try-outs so it's a good location to get your Maine outdoor adventure habit started.",
   "I was up in Brownfield by myself for the weekend and didn't want to waste a beautiful February day. Busted out my Maine Atlas in search of a little adventure not roo far away. I was rewarded with my  choice. Great scenery, easy to follow trails, more than enough directions to go to occupy a few hours.\nI'll definitely be back in the Spring and Summer with the family, or maybe just the dogs.",
   "Nice forest trails with views of the bay maybe a mile and a half to two miles on the outer loop.  Nothing terribly technical but good boots and wherewithal are recommended.  In the winter cleats would not be remiss.",
   "Always so breathtaking. It is God's place. Take your time, take in the ocean air and the views!! Stay a while and breathe. Year round.  Breathtaking beautiful.",
   "Wolfe\u2019s Neck is such a lovely state park. There aren\u2019t many facilities like camping or amenities such as organized tours at this park which helps it, I think, to keep a feeling of being authentically wild and serene. Though there are nicely maintained pathways and of course signage, it is a maintained state park. But I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that if you want to feel like you\u2019re really experiencing the land here, you can. The couple who bought the property and gifted it to the state, mandated that it would always be the way it is and would stay pristine. That shows! I really loved my visit and wish I could have stayed all day."

But the best part of this museum is the contents and the caretakers. The presentation is neet and professional.  And we even got a ride in a vintage model t.",
   "Great place to bring your children to teach them about the evolution of transportation. By far the best display of vintage cars and planes I've seen yet. Very enjoyable!",
   "Owls Head Transportation Museum is a great automotive museum for people to come and visit. They have tons of vehicles of all different shapes and sizes as well as decent prices for the type of museum you are at. The gift shop is small but has some nice little gifts in it however these prices do tend to be on the higher side. The transportation museum does more than offer a place to view different automobiles but they offer different events that are very interesting for locals and tourist. They some times will have live music events as well as different demonstrations of vehicles. When I was younger I attended a plane show as well as different bikes being shown. The presentation of the museum is great as well as the customer service. The parking is large and has easy access in and out of the museum. The location is just on the outskirts of Rockland which is difficult if you don't have transportation but that isn't usually a problem. Overall a great museum to come to visit even if you aren't into automobiles. If you ask questions I am sure you can get an answer as well as being educated on something new.",
   "Such a good place to take the kids. Thay have so many unique vehicles to see",
   "This is a great place but the admission is really high. Was a member 4 a year and a half, so I got to see most of the stuff. Truck n tractor is the best show in my opinion."

There is lots to be learned about the Shaker way of life and history here. We took the tour and our guide Don was informative and friendly. It was great to see some of the actual work and living spaces that The Shakers once used.  I was blown away by the blue paint used in the meeting house.  It was apparently made from a mixture which used blueberries as the color.  I can\u2019t remember the exact date, but I\u2019m pretty sure it was applied over 200 years ago! It still looked great, Benjamin Moore should try tapping into that formula.",

Multiple spots around the lakes so you can find your perfect spot. Dogs are allowed in some places as long as they stay leashed. You can also go fishing any spot you find cozy. Don't forget you need a license and they have a 2 fish maximum. \n\nThe main area has a nice playground, with swings. A nice little beach that goes slowly into the water, perfect for littles. There are plenty of grills and picnic tables to go around. There are outhouses located around the park and one is right by the main area. There is also a changing building located in the main area as well.\n\nThe fee is $2 a day or you can buy an annual pass as well. I don't remember the exact cost, but it is cheaper if you're a resident of Lisbon/Lisbon Falls. You can buy the pass at the Town Hall in Lisbon.",

Everyone should go check it out.",

It was well into dark  when we got back to the truck. We had alot of fun using a flashlight doing our little self tour. I would recommend it as a fun stop, especially with kids.",

   "Excellent seafood-whether fresh or fried! The problem  is you never know when open for even take out! Website says open, but you go there like I did today and it\u2019s closed! I even called to see why and no one answered and mailbox full. During the Covid-19 people are being very flexible and understanding but no notice to your loyal customers is really unacceptable.",
   "Awesome place locally to get seafood. Prices are best in town. Got 3 lbs of shucked lobster meat for Christmas stew. 1 tiny Shell in whole batch. Picked fresh and was still warm when I picked up. Saved $30.00 over competitors.",
   "This FRIED HADDOCK lunch plate was absolutely phenomenal. There was 3 adults including myself. We are all over 6feet yall with very health appetites, and this 1 plate went around 3ways and we were alllll super full and super satisfied. \nWe also picked up 10 lobsters for dinner later that night. This place did not disappoint at all. Being from the south, visiting Maine my expectations for food were very very complex. I know good food, and I love love love fresh seafood, and I'm a sucker for great customer service. Everything about this place was perfect\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f"

   "I had the prime rib quesadilla. It was delicious!",
   "Great place for a home cooked meal in a hurry.  The servers are very attentive and eager to please!  Prices are affordable too especially if you join their e-club to get discount coupons!",
   "Service was great, drinks good, music in the restaurant was surprisingly good! That's where it stops though. Ordered steak tips MR and they came out all sorts of temps from VERY WD all the way down to rare and the taste was lacking. Came in after about 8 years after having a bad meal and not sure I'll be back. 3 stars is because of the server we got. She was great and could tell I wasn't thrilled with the food but I just didn't want to complain.",
   "Great food and great prices. Service was good too. Spacious and clean inside. Loved eating here, though I probably over ate the food was so good."

I was surprised how elegant the plates were dressed with our food. I ended up doing a steak dish that was so tender and tasty.  Parking is good and easy to find.",
   "We have tried this place a couple times now. We find the hibachi to be much better atmosphere and food than the dine in side. Sushi is a little better than average and they do have very unique rolls. Something about the chicken there every time I try it, it does not taste good. They do accommodate gluten free diets very well. The hibachi chefs put on quite the show each time whether it's just two people or a full table you'll still get the experience.",
   "Great variety in rolls and drink specials from their full bar. The staff was kind and attentive throughout most of my dining experience. The sushi rolls were prepared with care and fresh ingredients. Couldn't be happier with my visit and can't wait to return!",

The steak was cooked wonderful but the asparagus was undercooked and still very crunchy, they offered to switch it out but I didn't like any of the other dishes they had. They say us in the very back of the restaurant where there was one other family with a very rambunctious child, kind of ruined date night. Otherwise not bad.",

   "The Sunday Brunch buffet, although quite pricey for my husband and I, is very delicious. Lots of choices already made up or have an omelette made to order. Very nice.",
   "The new pot stickers were fabulous, light and tender and beautiful, Oysters super fresh,  seafood medley great as always, honey soy and parmesan crusted scallops were both big hits. We ended happily with the chocolate mousse and triple berry meringue. It was quiet and the server was very pleasant and attentive. It was a very successful birthday dinner.",

I had a soup and a BLT, both of which were exactly what I was hoping for--crispy, fresh-cooked, thick-cut bacon and a wholesome, well-rounded beef and barley soup. I highly recommend them for a casual sit-down!",
   "After an appointment at Togus VA Hospital, Rebecca's Place seemed a good choice for lunch. Even though the restaurant was busy and patrons seat themselves, we were promptly greeted and brought menus. Our orders were taken in a timely manner and our food served reasonably quickly. My friend chose a Taco Salad which she described as \"Yummy\" several times. My choice was Meat Loaf with mashed potatoes covered in gravy and pickled beets. The mashed potatoes were good, the pickled beets excellent but the meat loaf a bit dry and bland. Rebecca's also offers a nice assortment of baked items to take home, most of which looked good to me. Good food along with excellent service earn Rebecca's a solid four star rating.",
   "A 45-minute drive have breakfast I was really wonder if I would like the place from the time you walk in you see all of all the fresh baked pastries then you're able to seat yourself the waitress was really friendly the menu was quite expensive for breakfast the atmosphere is nice to have pictures of all the owners grade kids along the wall the restaurants been in business since 1976 and the food was absolutely incredible it was probably the best poached eggs I've ever had in my life the baked beans were good but not great my wife had a skillet the head egg whites and vegetables mixed in with a side order Canadian bacon it was well worth the $20 for the bill and definitely worth the 45-minute drive it took me and my wife 6 years to get there but it will not take 6 years to get back there I highly recommend this gem which is an out-of-the-way restaurant which is well worth the trip",

   "Great food! Little pricey though. I have been to of equal quality thai food little north and its more for less; other than that had good service and good food.",
   "Food was delicious! Adorable napkin flower. Good place for a date. Location is odd but totally worth the food. Got the pad thai, golden chicken, and veggie tempura. Unfortunately no sushi that night but it was the night before valentines day and we came in later in the evening. would recommend!",
   "Stopped here on a recommendation from a friend. They said I'd be thanking them later and they were right! I didn't have the time to dine in, just ordered to go, but while I waited for my food I found the atmosphere to be relaxing and clean and everyone was very nice. Will definitely dine in next time! Food was ready within 20 minutes.  When I made it home....well let me back up and be honest.... the fried tofu never made it home, I ate that on the way.  But when I got the chance to eat everything else it was also delicious! Chicken satay was cooked perfectly, veggie tempura was not over or under cooked (for my tastes anyway), and everything was  arranged nicely in the containers. No stray/weird hairs, crunchy bits where there shouldn't be any, or unappealing colors my brain had to try to explain away. I'll update my review once I go back for the dine in experience but for now 10/10 - highly recommend! It's my new favourite thai place. ;)"

   "Great food and quality service. Went out with the team from work for taco Tuesday and had a blast. Really enjoyed the pork soft tacos and the coconut lime margarita.",
   "Food was good, as usual but everything else about this visit was terrible.\n\nMy girlfriend and I sat in the lounge because the other side of the restaurant had a 20 minute wait and we were starving.  We sat ourselves as we were told.  It take between 10 and 15 minutes before we got a waitress come to our table.  we had one woman come to our table and give us chips.  another 5 or 10 minutes goes by and a different waitress comes over, hands us menus and said that she was going to serve us.  I told her we already had a waitress and she replied that she was moved to a different table.  we order our drinks.  My girlfriend got her soda within seconds. My alcoholic drink took close to ten minutes, I had to remind the waitress twice.  After about 20 minutes, I got my drink, which was terribly made, and she took our orders.\n\nTook close to 45 minutes to get our food.  I witnessed people who sat down after us get their food before us. I also saw 3 couples get up and leave. When we finally got our food it was delicious.\n\nNo one came to ask us our food was or to refill our drinks.  When we were done eating.  I had to ask twice for the receipt.  When the waitress gave it to us, she asked how everything was, and I told her the service was terrible and my drink was garbage.  She asked if I wanted to talk the manager to have it taken off our bill, I told her that I didn't want to wait half an hour to talk to someone over 8$ \n\nI get it, some times places are busy but we spent close to 2 hours here and it should have been close to an hour.  Either hire more staff or train current staff to be quicker.",

   "Great place! The bun on my burger was quite soggy but they were more than happy to fry up a new bun! We got the fiery ghost tavern double, the mad love burger with chili fries, mac and cheese and the prime chophouse! It was delicious and our waiter was phenomenal!",
   "The place is clean and the employees are amazing. They were busy and the manager came out and helped with a smile on his face. He asked if we wanted sauce and I told him to surprise me. He brought out 6 different sauces. Amazing place and the food is to die for.",
   "We have eaten at Red Robin many times.  The service is always good and the food always tasty. Have been using curbside service during COVID19 limitations. Food and service are still great.",
   "I must say the food was very good.\nIt was all well cooked and as advertised.\nThe drinks also seemed like they were priced competitive with other restaurants.\nOne thing worthy of mentioning was the portion size in proportion to the size of the plate.\nThe plates were so large that the meal looked very small and skimpy even though the meal itself was a moderate size and more than enough food.",
   "We love Red Robin in Augusta! The food has always been great and the wait staff always so friendly! It makes a huge difference when you can laugh with your server. I highly recommend starting with the Towering Onion Rings. I don't know what they do for theirs but they are ALWAYS SO crispy and the onion never slides out when you take a bite like with other onion rings. Paired with the camp fire sauce it is a winner!! We only had one incident there over the years where after we were seated no one came to take our drink and food order. We waited 20 minutes and finally had to ask for our server. Before we left the manager on staff came over and apologized and comped our appetizers for the inconvenience. They take pride in good food and good service and make it right when things go wrong. It's one of our favorite places to go!"

   "Red Barn is a local institution, & for good reason. They know how to handle seafood! Lobster rolls are scrumptious. Fried clams are breaded fresh, not yanked out of a freezer. Fries have always been cooked just right & served hot. Even though they get busy, they do a fine job of keeping food flowing out of the kitchen.  Recommend!",
   "Great small little fast food establishment.  Friendly, clean, and fantastic exterior dining area.  While the food is a lot of your comfort fried foods, the environment is very enjoyable.  The owner also seems to support various vendor activities with their profits - very cool!",
   "Always love the positive vibes felt here. Used to bring my mom in her wheelchair. They made her Celebrity of the Day once and gave her a pin. A cherished memory.",
   "Absolutely amazing food, great prices, and an extremely friendly and welcoming atmosphere. To top it all off, Laura (the owner) does a tremendous amount of wonderful things for a lot of folks in the community, veterans, and people in nursing homes. The Red Barn is a fantastic place to eat, they have the best homemade whoopie pies, and I would highly recommend trying them!",
   "Best place ever to eat.  Fried Chicken, clams, fish, FF, burgers, etc. etc. Quick service, fun staff, but best of all is Laura Benedict the owner. Laura is widely known as the lady that never quits. She does fundraisers for people in need, she helps military people, you name itLaura does it without expecting anything in return except the joy of doing it. if for no other reason, you need to go to the Red Barn just to meet this lady she will leave a lasting impression on your heart."

I literally started counting after the 2nd time. I\u2019m glad that the staff feels like a family however it\u2019s completely unprofessional and I think working in an environment for so long with an open concept kitchen you forget that the dining area is only separated by a counter and not a wall. I\u2019m sorry to have to post this as I\u2019ve been a patron for years and enjoy the food, but I think there needs to be a little bit more respect for your customers that are trying to enjoy lunch :(",

   "Whippers by far has one of the best pizzas in Augusta. Your staff operates like a well oiled machine and you can count on I\u2019m not waiting too long for your food. Everything taste really good, Peters is just so expensive everywhere! But Whippers offers a crazy lunch deal so you should check it out. They also deliver"

Andy working in the tasting room was wonderful and we had great conversations with him about all the beers and the brewery in general. The beers were all excellent and the pizza was delicious! We went back up to the restaurant after our flights and pizza to get pints. We also got some gourmet popcorn! It\u2019s a great brewery/tasting room, I highly recommend and can\u2019t wait to go back. I\u2019ll be checking out their Annex location next!",
   "We had six adults and two toddlers and had good service and great food.  Spicy popcorn was a nice surprise, the beer selection was good and pizza tasty. Would recommend for the atmosphere and reasonable prices. Can't beat the wood fired oven.  Nice to have another restaurant in the downtown area.",
   "(5 stars for the pizza and 3 stars for the restaurant) I love their pizza, especially \"The Diner Closes at 2\".  The restaurant has a great atmosphere too, except for one thing:  When it is busy, the noise level is incredibly high due to flat walls and ceilings that reflect all the sound.  Please, owners, add some sound absorbing tiles or do something else to mute the echoes!",
   "Love the beer and the brewery! This is Long Time Listener and is my new favorite IPA. The pizza was also amazing! We had the Mill Park Pie and it was an excellent flavor combo! 10/10 will be back. I\u2019ve also tried most of their beers and they are amazing. Great local company."

   "Five Guys, at least this location, is an over-hyped, over-priced burger joint. The hamburger, small as it was, was good, nothing great. The fries, very abundant in quantity, were good as well but didn't have a freshly cut-up potato taste to them. My beverage of choice, a strawberry milk shake was shamefully small for the price and had a strong artificially flavored taste to it. I've had MUCH better food at other Five Guys locations.",
   "Delicious burgers, fries and shakes! It can be expensive...last time I was there I spent $17 for a burger, small fries and a milkshake which was a pricey lunch... but it was all delicious. So much better than the drive-thru fast food chains. And of course: great service from a friendly, energetic team!",
   "Greatest burgers around. But if you cant eat a double be sure to order the little that's a single patty. Those with peanut allergies beware. Free peanuts to snack on while waiting for you order and I believe they use peanut oil to cook fries in.",
   "Best burgers in town! Can be a little on the expensive side but definitely  worth every penny. Awesome customer service.",
   "Great French fries and shakes. My son says the burgers are also great but I don't eat meat. A veggie burger would be a nice add to the menu. The veggie sandwich they sell is so-so."

BETTER THAN THE 5-STAR RATING!!!!! \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764",
   "This establishment certainly has its act together. The environment was perfectly clean, the overall ambiance well calibrated to the motif. The service was prompt, professional and pleasant, thank you very much Melody. The timing of courses was spot-on and the food was delicious as well as reasonably priced. The digital table top device they've got going was also pretty spiffy. Worth a stop in. 5 stars, no complaints.",
   "Some coworkers and I had a great lunch today. We were in and out in about an hour. I do recommend using the option online to put yourself on the wait list ahead of time as sometimes there's quite a long wait. My lasagna was good, the staff was pleasant and we enjoyed the option to split and pay for our check at the table. It's your typical Olive Garden, but one of the better options around if you're looking for a chain restaurant.",
   "My daughter and I were stuck in a corner, beside a family of 10! My waitress was wonderful! The other 2 seaters were not so lucky. Their waitress, loudly told them, how she would never eat here and even recommended several other places to go! I told management and watched him walk around and repeat to the staff, what I told him in confidence!! I've worked , in this industry , since I was 14. Never been so embarrassed! Will not go back!",
   "Service was fair, they stuck us in a back corner which was a little unappealing considering they weren't very busy. I was with my girl-friend and kind of felt they stuck us in the corner for a reason. The drinks were great but the plates were a bit small. Would like to try this place again sometime. Maybe a different location."

Why even try to stay in business. I ordered food for 3 people not one thing was correct and apparently I'm not the only 1 , 2 or 3 other people were headed in to return their order... Before the pandemic I was it 2 to 3 times a week person there, I'm gonna place another order next week. See how it goes , Hopefully this is just a fluke..",

To make matters worse half scoops of beans and rice at the same full price. Even better I had fruit flies flying around my food...in February. Very disappointing. I eat at Chipotle locations several times a month. This was by far my worst experience.",

The food is fres, cooked and prepared right in front of you. The staff is friendly and always efficient. Even with a line out the door I can be in and out in less than 12m. I used to go the way if their classic burrito (because I love the warm tortillas), but now I go with the bowls. \nThe meats are tasty, tender and seasoned well. The guacamole rivals some of the better Mexican stops and the veggies have never been brown or wilted.  It's worth the visit as fast and fresh is better than fast and fried everytime."

   "Our first time in this place was absolutely amazing! There were only our group and one other table in the restaurant at the time. The service was excellent and the food was awesome. One of the very best Chinese food experiences I have ever had. It came up in my Google search and had very good reviews. After eating there I can see why! Our server was quick to seat and set us up, very personable, and the wait for our meals was quite short. I'd recommend the Amazing Garden to anyone seeking a first class meal. The portions were very large and we took a good bit with us when we left. If you're in the Augusta area and looking for Chinese then the Amazing Garden would be, in my opinion, the place to go. Stop on in and try it out for yourself. I garantee you won't leave disappointed! Large menu and drink selection and great atmosphere, and service with a smile. They certainly won me over and I'll be going back again!",
   "Ordered food from their website as they do delivery. The website clearly states that they're open. Yet our food was never delivered and no one is answering the phone when we call. If they're actually closed they need to list that on their website so people aren't ordering food as it's a good way to get poor reviews. I would love to be writing a better review but unfortunately they never gave me that option.",

   "Customer service was excellent. Store and bathroom were clean. But I paid almost $10 for a ham italian with extra black olives. There was less than 1/2 oz of meat and barely any black olives, though I paid for extra. A foot long sandwich shoul have no less than 4 oz of meat. So if you don't mind eating an expensive pickle sandwich, then this is the place. \n\nAs you can see I ate it anyways as I picked the thing up on my hour long drive home. It WAS a tasty pickle sandwich, but it wasn't what I would call an italian sandwich. Side note: their black olives are actually greek olives, which is my favorite.",
   "First time at Amato's, and it won't be the last. For breakfast, I wanted an egg and cheese muffin with sausage and peppers. Asked if possible as it wasn't on the menu. Within a few minutes I had a delicious muffin with filled with an egg, creamy cheese, peppers and onion. YUMMY! Thank you Omar for your friendly welcome and for sharing a bit about Amato's history. Really enjoyed my first visit, looking forward to trying their other menu options as well as getting that muffin again.",
   "Service was good and timely. Veggie stuffers were big disappointment.  Those used to be my favorite even tho I havent had them in about a year. When I opened the box I was shocked. 6 before filled almost the box , now they are the size of a silver dollar. Won't do that again.",
   "Nice quick lunch in the center of agusta. I've never been to an amato's before and this was good. The guy behind the counter was the nicest restaurant worker I have ever encountered, nice job amato's. The food was good too.",

   "Wander Pizza is awesome.   The pizza, apps and sandwiches are all fantastic.  The hand made crust is fully developed, flavorful and consistent.   The variety of pizza  toppings and other  ingredients is  impressive, but what really takes it the over  top is their freshness and quality.  Fresh toppings(no canned jalapenos!) local meats when possible, and a variety of traditional and funky cheeses.  There is a great selection of small-time regional sodas, the big name sodas, seltzers, and a widerange of great beer on tap, local and otherwise.  \nThere's a nice variety of slices available throughout the day, and the best happy hour in central Maine.   On any given day, there's no telling what surprise toppings you might find on a pizza special.  \nTo top all that, the staff is friendly, fun and efficient.  Jesse, the owner,  is ALWAYS there,  busting his tail putting a lot of care into every bit of food that leaves the kitchen.   \nAugusta used to be a pizza wasteland.  Now,  with the arrival of Wander, we  have one of the best pizzas places in the state.  It's very family friendly and also  super easy to access  right off of  95.    \nThis is a legit review that I've been meaning to write for a while.     We've eaten  there probably 30 times since it opened.  It's been great every time, and now Jessie and his staff feel like friends that just happen to serve killer pizza and beer.",
   "Great custom pizza with a good selection of craft beer on tap.",
   "This is a gem!  You will not regret stoping at this pizza shop!  New York style pizza with many toppings available and craft beer.  Nice people good atmosphere.  They deserve your business.",
   "New owners, changed pizza ovens, amazing results. Great place is now fantastic. Possibly best pizza in Augusta. More craft beer and nice update to decor make for a very inviting a cozy spot.",
   "A jewel of a place in Augusta. Nice atmosphere, great tap list and the pizza was outstanding! Give it a try!"

   "Since leaving Virginia we have tried to find a Mexican Restaurant in the area. Except for not having White Sauce for my chips they are great! Food is seasoned well and very tasty!",
   "First time ever to this place and the service was fast awesome and really good food.  there house cheese sauce is amazing. I tried there  Burrito loco and would definitely order again",
   "Wanted to give this restaurant a try.  Having been born and raised in Texas, with most of my time In San Antonio, I am partial to good Mexican.  \n\nWaking in we were immediately greeted and seated.  The restaurant is festive, and very clean.  Great drink menu, with plenty of choices for margaritas. Chips and salsa immediately upon being seated. A plus!  We ordered the guacamole. We loved it.  For entrees, by wife ordered the combo beef and chicken fajitas.  She said they were out of this world.  I have the enchiladas Del Mar.  Plenty of crab and shrimp rolled in corn tortilla with a creamy, not to heavy sauce.  So tasty, and sorry no leftovers.  What a great addition to Augusta!  A must try!!",
   "Food we had was better than the same from the other Mexican restaurant. Unique/colorful chairs, tables and booths. Best part...they can comfortably accommodate large parties. Roomy tables for 8-12. Sauces flavorful but not burn-your-mouth spicy. Prices are good. Hope they do well.",
   "Food...AMAZING.\nService... AWESOME.\nPrice...PERFECT.\n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone! Will definitely be going there again! \ud83d\ude0b"

   "We have been coming here for years, always on our way to and from Canada through Boston, way prior to Panera ever expanding into New Mexico where we live.  \n\nIt used to always be bustling with patrons, clean, and with friendly staff.  This time was definitely a stark contrast to that.  Hopefully it's not like this everyday, but even though there was hardly anyone there, it was hard to find a clean table, and the staff was too busy to pay any attention to the customers.  Granted, the help-yourself tablets encourage the staff to be hands-off, but at other Panera establishments that have adopted that, it's across the way from the cash registers and they are happy to let you choose whether to use the tablet or take your order for you.  It seems like they are understaffed, overworked, and were just plain tired.  \n\nThe food was still exactly what Panera always offers, even if they did make one mistake on one of our sides, that's typical and they are happy to fix it once you get their attention.  I like to get the lobster roll on our drive up this time of year since they are generous with it and it's not finely chopped nor covered in too much dressing.  Their bread bowls, sandwich bread, and baguette on the side is always on point.",
   "Love Panera! We drive over an hour just to go. Fresh, great tasting food. Nice staff. Decent prices.",
   "Great tasting food. Could use more vegetarian soups as there are only 2 options currently as some of the vegetable cream soups have a meat soup base. Sandwiches are amazing too.",
   "Went in at 8:10pm and they were cleaning and we asked if they were closing and they said at 10. I barely ever come here so I didn\u2019t know the soup didn\u2019t automatically come in a bread bowl which my daughter had recommended. When I asked the girl (wearing a plaid shirt with glasses) if the pick 2 came in a bread bowl she said no it doesn\u2019t automatically come in a bread bowl and have to specify it in a very rude tone. Even my teenage daughter couldn\u2019t believe how rude she was. Then we decided we didn\u2019t want to eat there since they worried more about closing than serving us. We said never mind and she just rolled her eyes and shook her head. I\u2019ll never eat there again.",
   "Food was very tasty. They were out of the two side breads I requested (totaling $7) so they offered to give us 5 bagels instead (totaling well over $10) I was very pleased with that! Very friendly associates there"

   "They have the best salads in the area.  I\u2019m a big fan of their cobb salad - the large version of this is a very hearty meal full of proteins and low on carbohydrates.  Most would probably be happy with the regular size, but the large is perfect for those with bigger appetites.\n\nThey make their salads fresh, so you have the option of deleting some items from your salad if you are so inclined.  I take mine with everything - fresh lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, scallions, blue cheese crumbles and a generous helping of sliced chicken.  Dressing comes on the side and is delicious, too.\n\nStaff are always pleasant, even when it\u2019s busy.  Orders never take long, but you can always call ahead if you are in a hurry.",
   "Best wraps anywhere. Although they are a little pricey their sandwiches are delicious. The only con is that they are open mostly when state of Maine offices are open. They make excellent breakfast and lunch wraps. The owner is friendly and hands-on. I couldn\u2019t give them anything less than five stars",
   "Just ordered for the first time, delivery because of covid. They had the wraps at my door in 15 minutes, they were huge, and delicious. Will definitely order again!",
   "Wrapped Up is a great little lunch spot. Their selection of wraps and salads is different from the everyday. Things were made fresh to order. I ordered a small wrap and it was bigger than a 12\" sub from other sandwich shops. The place was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.",
   "I always liked bay wrap, but it seems to have gone a little down hill after this ownership change. I always have gotten the bubbas even back then, but the quality was not so great last time around. The pulled pork was hard as a rock and dry. I came in around lunch hour too, so it\u2019s not like it should\u2019ve been dried out. I give 3 stars because I think it has potential to be better next time, and I know it\u2019s pretty difficult owning a food business. But I\u2019ve had better."

We would definitely recommend this place and plan to go back.",

We also were going to get dessert but changed out minds because of the waiting.It was busy, but not overly so other people that came in later seemed to be getting  waited on quicker.\n\nThis may have just been and off day, another visit may prove different? In the end though it was disappointing when there seemed to be so much potential for a great experience.",
   "With family visiting, we stopped by for lunch and had a great visit. The staff were all super friendly, the food portions were generous, and everything tasted great. Very family friendly place too.",
   "Excellent selection of beer and a great outdoor space, unfortunately I have often found the food to be unexceptional. A good place to go in summer for a brew and a game of bags.",
   "A great atmosphere ,staff , food and .music! Shannon Denbow was amazing!!"

   "Wow I love Slates! The gourmet food, the excellent service and superior drinks! It doesn't get any better in central Maine then this! It can be really busy and a little loud so get a reservation ahead and  then enjoy. Ask If Courtney is bar tending try one of her Mojitos, she does an amazing job with them. You wont be disappointed",
   "Hot cider on a chilly day...\nFlatiron steak basil eggs Benedict was all amazing!!! \nOh and coconut blueberry bread..\nI also ate strawberry rhubarb pie... No pic. \nWe stopped in bakery next door for pumpkin chocolate chip cookie..\nMust visit this place again!!!",
   "Delectable seafood, romantic atmosphere, warm relaxing music and friendly prompt waitress. They had a nice table ready for us when we arrived. Fresh flowers and candles were on the table.",
   "Awesome smoked shrimp and caramelized onions benedict... Delicious bloody martini... Short wait, lovely staff. Overall a wonderful brunch experience.",
   "If you're local, you already know how great it is. If you're from away like us, it's an amazing find. We're not passing by Augusta on the highway again without making this short detour."

   "My whole family enjoyed eating here. The decision was carefully done, and the food is especially tasty. Every single thing we ordered was exceptional. The menu is small, which to me, is a good thing. They focus on a few things they do well, rather than deliver sub-par food from a large menu. The wait staff didn't bother us while we were eating, and provided just the right amount of interaction when we needed it. I would definitely recommend the pulled pork!!\nOnly thing I didn't like was the blasting country music. We could barely hear each other talking at our table.",
   "Fun bar. Saddles should go.",
   "Cornbread is worth the trip alone! I had the brisket on special and it tasted a bit cheap but the cost was also on par for the food. Chipotle chicken tacos were terrific and just the right amount of spice. Unfortunately I do prefer riverfront a food but the atmosphere here beats riverfront by a mile. Overall worth a visit!",
   "Great food and portions. Like nothing else you can get around town. Saddles are super fun and my kids want to come next time to sit in them. Drinks are NOT watered down. Will be back",
   "Awesome place and great service and awesome music too."

   "Went here once. It was bad. The food was lukewarm and getting stale. The staff didn't seem to pay attention to what they were doing and the cost is ridiculous. If you want a good Chinese place, check out Amazing Garden on Western Avenue.",
   "Great service today from \"Jlo\". They don't have a lot of vegetarian options for their buffet so Jlo (nickname) our waitress ordered me some vegetarian egg rolls and rice. Making the buffet worth it. Food was delicious. And the service was fantastic!! Thank you!!",
   "Great for fast lunch, buffet has hot freshly cooked food!",
   "I love the fried rice here - has carrots, peas, onions, pork bits . . . Pretty and yummy.  The atmosphere is calm and the location is perfect.",
   "This is a casual Chinese place with optional buffet style service. The servers were friendly and the atmosphere was bright and pleasant. We came at lunchtime on Easter Sunday so business was rather quiet. The food was pretty good (though not exceptional) but you do get a lot for the price, especially if you do the buffet. Overall this is a solid stop for casual Asian dining"

   "Highly recommend getting the daily vegetarian pasta special with. Chicken, shrimp or salmon. It's the best kept secret of this place.  The chef is gifted in his sauce creations.  Always new interesting and very tasty.",
   "This place is always awesome. Food is the best around in my opinion. Beer is top notch.",
   "The food always hits the spot with their generous portions and the beers are consistently good. I always make sure to get my souvenir cup when i stop by. Make sure they rinse the souvenir cup, those things could be dusty and you'll have floaters in your beer.",
   "Very good beer and pretty good food. The biggest complaint about this place is that it is often packed and noisy. Great for a night out at the pub but not the place for a quiet dinner.",
   "Had a great time here. We arrived late around 9. Was able to locate this restaurant without much hassle of driving around. The place was still a bit crowded even at 9. However since the majority of the crowd had left, we got the seats fairly fast. To the readers: Would definitely recommend reserving a table or be ready to wait for a while. \n\nThe menu had limited veggie and chicken option. We tried the garlic parmesan wings, freshly made fries, salads and the chicken tenders. Food was served fast. They had a great selection of beer. Staff was polite and helped us in making some good choices from the menu. The desert selection is not on the regular menu, do ask the server specifically if you feel like eating desert. We tried the lemon cheesecake and it was delicious. On the outside, it was located near the state house and the place was safe to drive around. There was a small parking lot behind the property but considering the crowd, it may fill up quickly. Street parking was available."

   "I got take-out and asked them to minimize plastic and they gave me almost all PAPER containers --you know the old Chinese food ones from way back that work awesome and biodegrade!!  And the food was really good.  I think the food is better than it was several months ago.  It was delicious.  The yellow curry was dreamy and the noodles were really fine.  But the fact that I didn't have to be responsible for eight or so plastic containers is the very best of all! Love them. Everyone offering take-out should go the same.",
   "Great food and service. The sushi rolls were fresh and delicious. Was happy to find this place with a great view along the river",
   "I love the crazy noodle and hot sake. The restaurant itself is a little odd, very open and poor acoustics. Wait staff has always been good. I do prefer to get takeout.",
   "We ordered sushi to go and waited almost an hour to get out food. The sushi was warm and not fresh. Sushi should be served cold. Somebody is going to get sick.",
   "Worst experience ever they call themselves a sushi restaurant but they cant take the crab skin and shell off before they roll it. Totally disgusting the poor excuse of a chef said he wouldn't refund me. I even explained that me and my fiance go out to sushi alot and I have never been more mortified at a \"sushi\" restaurant I've had better sushi at a buffet. Very poor customer service. The front desk lady said the owner wasnt there to speak to me  then the \"chef\" all of a sudden could get me on the phone with him. Once again very poor customer service."

   "This place is our new favorite spot. It\u2019s our comfort food, or go to, our new Christmas Eve tradition. Don\u2019t be intimidated at the prices, everything\u2019s worth it, we always order one dish short for a large group and have plenty of left overs with full happy bellies. We eat out less and just go to this place, guilt free. The food is delicious and despite me mispronouncing most all orders we\u2019ve never had a mistake.",
   "What a delicious and delightful dinner my friend and I had here last night. (We had to order takeout due to the pandemic) Everything was amazing and authentic. We passed by it on the way to our new home the other day and knew we had to try Mughal Palace.\nThe Gobi pakora were amazing as were the samosas. My friend got the daal saag and I got the lamb pasanda and we would definitely order them again, although there are so many other items we're eager to try too. My friend loved the raita and I could have eaten a whole bowl of the green chutney by itself.\nAnyway, give this place a try, it's totally worth it.",
   "This is not just another Indian place . This is authentic food with fresh meat . I would say this is the almost same food I get beach in India . Mutton  tikka masala is Cooked near perfection . Butter naan were fresh . I would recommend you try this place if you are looking for some Indian cuisine with local produce ."
