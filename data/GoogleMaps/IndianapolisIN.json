   "We love the Children\u2019s Museum! And I love that it\u2019s always changing to keep our membership worth having.  The outdoor sports section was an amazing add on!  I do wish it was more affordable though.  When we have friends come into town we aren\u2019t always able to go.",
   "We have fun each time we go. Kids love the dinosaur exhibit and pop culture exhibit.  The outdoor sport area looks cool but it closes in the winter so we didn't see it this time.  There is an indoor sports exhibit too.  Good food court with a lot of options.  About 30.00 per adult.  20.00 for kids.  Ample free parking in their connected garage.  Great for all age children.  Easy to get to. Very clean and updated.  Certain exhibits change often.",
   "Overall it\u2019s really nice and updated, I would say the layouts rather strange and kind of maze-like. This is definitely a place for learning and fun, age group is about 5-10 I would say however, any age could enjoy what\u2019s at the children\u2019s museum. They offer a large amount of discounts for example: students or seniors. What I enjoyed most about this recent trip is the new addition of the Greece section. That area is an additional price however it\u2019s offered for a limited time. There is more to come in 2020!",
   "We love the museum. The staff are friendly and helpful. They really seem to have a passion for children. The facilities are clean and there is everything you need to have a successful trip. The Playscape is great for toddlers and even has a small confined area for crawling babies. Some of the exhibits are a little over my kids heads, but the map they pass out has age recommendations too. We love the family bathrooms and room for nursing mother's too. Can't wait to go back!",
   "Great place even for adults! We went with no kids just to scope it out. Did not regret it! Also, they had a nice selection of food in the food court, not just concession food. They even had a salad bar. The China and Egypt exhibits were well done. Go see the planetarium show about how science fiction becomes fact, it was great and free with admission. The Greece exhibit has a lot of neat cultural facts that I didn't know. Very interesting!"

   "Was surprised by the dolphin show. Was very in-depth and to my knowledge one of the only ones at a zoo. However, the zoo itself was fairly small. A few of the exhibits were closed for renovations and we were in and out in less than 2 hours. For comparison we spent almost 4 hours and didn't see everything at the NC zoo. Surprisingly small for a large town and had to pay for parking on-site.",
   "This is a wonderful zoo. We were lucky enough to have a couple extra hours before our flight out of Indianapolis and went to the zoo, which is about 15 minutes away from the airport.  So glad we did.  It was decorated with millions of lights.  The animals were out and about.  The dolphins are magnificent.  They have WALRUSES!!! Which is super rare. I'd love to go back in the summer and see more. Also,  during the holidays,  there is a Santa and you get a time slot for free when you arrive.  We didn't get to see him because of our flight time constraints.  I'm sure it would have been lovely.  \nThis zoo is a gem.",
   "It was an awesome experience.   Beautifully decorated.   Everyone whom I encountered were exuding the Christmas spirit.  The temperature for this time of the year was awesome and the hot chocolate was great. Great appreciation for all who participated in hanging the lights and setting up the displays. Looking forward to next year.   Merry Christmas.",
   "The zoo itself is nice and spacious. Different little activities for kids and interactions for everyone. Definitely an improvement over the years. However, a few things that stood out about this visit. One, my two year old made a remark a few times about the animals seeming sad (mainly all the the primate varieties and birds). Two, I didn't notice many foraging or entertainment options for many animals. That's kinda sad as an animal owner myself. And three, the macaw cage was SEVERELY lacking in opportunities. Macaws are very intelligent and even though they are in an aviary, there seemed to be many lacking opportunities. At the time of our visit I did not see any captive foraging for ANY BIDS HOUSED. Nor toys or puzzle opportunities. The larger macaws seemed stressed and agitated by the shear number of birds coupled with lack of entertainment and we're picking at each other. Not like bonded grooming but picking at feet and wings. As a bird owner it is hard to explain the disappointment. Overall, wasn't too bad but would definitely recommend more activities for animals l.",
   "Recently went to Christmas at the Zoo. It just so happened to snow that night. The snow made it SO much better. Attractions and activities were nice as well.  Very festive. Would highly recommend on s snow day. Makes the lights shine brighter."

   "First time escapers had a great time very hard though but fun.",
   "This escape room was very well done. The clues were difficult, and our group was challenged on the intermediate and advanced rooms (we went twice). I loved how the rooms were decorated and the themes. This was a great activity for our multi-generational family over the holidays. Everyone enjoyed it, especially when we managed to escape. I would definitely recommend this place for an hour of fun.",
   "Great way to spend an hour testing your collaboration skills with family, friends or coworkers.  We did the \"Space 2112\" room which I would rate as quite challenging.  Excellent props and staging. Better have a math whiz with you if you get this room.",
   "We do a ton of room escapes so this is just our perspective.  We did the heist few years ago and it has way too many keys and the puzzles weren't our favorite so we wrote this place off. Then we did the art heist and loved it! The puzzles were simple and straightforward but the mechanisms were neat. The game master gave us some great recommendations for future rooms to try for our group. My family has also raved about their fishers location. Looking forward to coming back and doing some of the more complex rooms!",

   "Beautiful monument, the water feature is an amazing backdrop for an awesome piece of art.  The roundabout makes it feel like international destination.  Great stop in the middle of a 10 mile run.",
   "Recently had some downtime and decided to check this place out. Didn't actually realize how high this place was until I reached the top. Elevator was busted which is not an issue for me, but I think you'd get more out of it by climbing the stairs anyway. Nice staff at the gift shop and overall a pleasent experience if you've never been there. The attention to detail on the structure itself is worth having a look. Go there when you have some time to enjoy the atmosphere of the city moving around you.",
   "We really enjoyed exploring downtown Indy on foot. This was one of our destinations. Unfortunately, we couldn't enter to climb to the top as it was closed because they were installing Christmas lights. But it was still very enjoyable to observe all the intricate details of this monument from the outside.",
   "Recognized as one of the world\u2019s outstanding monuments. The largest outdoor memorial in the United States to be dedicated to the common soldier. Surrounded by restaurants and businesses and is a great place to relax and observe.",
   "The monument is enormous and beautiful to look at. We climbed to the top and really enjoyed the challenge. The views were good, but not absolutely breathtaking for me. I can\u2019t help but compare these kinds of views to the Columbia center skyview observatory in Seattle and that\u2019s hard to beat. Still really glad we did it, though! \n\nThe staircase gets pretty tight at the top, so it can be a bit crowded, but the elevator wasn\u2019t running which meant everyone was walking up and down, making a bit more congested than it might have been otherwise. The last several flights have space for one person side to side, while the flights below have room for about 2."

   "I haven't been here in several years but enjoyed the time I spent here. The park is beautiful and the canal walk was unexpectedly quiet and peaceful, especially for being in downtown Indianapolis. Its conveniently close to the zoo also. Parking can be an issue so give extra time to find a spot or pay to park which can be a bit pricey.",

We had such an awesome time we are already talking about going back to do another one. It was a surprise for my boyfriend and they made it super easy for me to have someone drop off our cooler earlier in the day to make the whole \u201csurprise\u201d seamless. The whole process from purchasing the Handlebar on line, obtaining FAQs, and signing the waiver was super smooth and easy. We were very happy! Thanks guys!"

There is music, writing etc. great ideas! You can tell this idea was thought through.",

We did soup and grilled cheese combos (This and That they called it).  My tomato basil soup was awesome, but my daughter\u2019s Chicken Velvet was the best chicken soup I\u2019ve ever tasted.  The grilled cheese had turkey and roasted red pepper on sourdough.  Wonderful lunch.",
   "Great place for children and adults. We have been several times and it never disappoints. Always friendly and helpful staff, very clean and all the displays are in great shape and well kept. Not wore out like other museums. I highly recommend going and taking the kids. If you do the Imax movie, you get free parking in the garage! So totally worth it!",
   "This is a great place to learn about Indiana's history. It caters to kids with hands on exhibits. Great for school groups and events. It's right on the canal which offers lots of activities. They offer fantastic traveling exhibits and have an IMax theater with new releases available. Great place to go.",

   "This state park turned City park is awesome, packed with animal life, especially birds of many kinds. I haven't found a park around Indianapolis with as wide of a variety of bird species. Trails are long and have some very pretty and calming views. Park pass cost is fairly expensive especially since it only covers that park, but if you live or work near the location, you can easily get your moneys worth in the amount of time you can spend there. There are several extras here such as boats, zip lines, and nature centers to give the place an extra bit of fun for the whole family.",

Nature, Community, active lifestyle, and preservation/ conservation is a win.",

   "Visiting from out of town with very little exposure to racing in general, I really enjoyed our visit. I loved the tour of the track, hearing about the traditions of the Indy 500, and exploring the museum with all of the history it contains.\n\nIf you enjoy auto racing, or are interested in learning about something new, this would be a fun activity. \n\nWe were there for two hours (including the track tour) and it felt like a good amount of time for someone who knows so little about racing. If you have more knowledge going in, you could easily spend way more time in the museum. There\u2019s so much to read and learn. \n\n4 stars because for me, it was fun, but not an absolute must.",
   "Truly a dream come true!! I have been a life long Indy fan. I showed up Saturday morning right as the museum opened. I did the kiss the bricks tour which included admission into the museum. A lap around the track was memorable. Highly recommend this experience to any racecar fan",
   "A great facility that I was lucky enough to tour this Fall. The most fascinating thing is the \"City\" within the infield - all the activity, buildings, etc., is amazing. We were able to tour the pit lane, luxury boxes, and victory lane - all of which was amazing. It was also great to see the winner of the BC39 midget race displayed next to the Indy 500 and Brickyard 400 winners - that was really special to a dirt track racing fan.",
   "The best time to see the lights on the track was New Year's Eve! Hardly any traffic and drove through without a hassle. The lights were great, but my wife loved being able to drive on the actual track. Granted, it was about 4 mph, but we were there. On the track. Down the straightaway!",
   "Definitely the oldest racetrack you've ever been to. Definitely cool. It's worth it I think to pay for the parking passes to get a good parking spot near the track. Just buy them ahead of time before they jack the prices up!"

   "Eiteljorg is a must see when in Indy. The collection is diverse with an emphasis on Western art, but also interpretive areas with artifacts and artwork of North American Indian cultures and regions. They have excellent contemporary exhibits and a children's exploration area. When possible, parking is validated in their garage. We also had a meal at the cafe. The butternut squash and beet salad was tasty and prices affordable. Loved the southwest influenced interior design.",
   "Was really cool! Went specifically for the Jingle Rails exhibit and love it, worth $15 alone. We also saw the rest of the museum too, less interactive than I thought it be. It's mostly art museum though there are two exhibits on the second floor that are interactive one of them goes through the history and culture of different Native American communities the other is for art that you are allowed to touch(my favorite exhibit). \nOverall it's good for gathering information but I wouldn't suggest you bring your kids, but they might get bored.",
   "One of the best museums in the US for American Indian and West American art. Quite an extensive collection of art on display and they have different special exhibits throughout the year. Jingle Rails during the Christmas season is a favorite. Each year they seem to add something new to the display. This year it was the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Amazing how it is all made of nature materials. Highly recommend."

It was really cool to see some of the people who went through the days and nights after the sinking. \nAnd it's all free. So go and check it out, learn about Indiana's history in war.  It's worth it. \nThe place was very clean and well done and the staff is very friendly. \nWe will absolutely be back.",

Free entry, friendly staff, in mid week there was almost no one there. \n\nHave to start by going to the upstairs memorial - breathtaking\n\nThen go through time in the exhibits, all are authentic and very informative. You can spend hours or just a quick visit, depending how avid you are on history",
   "Excellent museum in a stunning and conveniently located building downtown. The museum itself is very well laid out, with amazing and informative displays covering every conflict from pre-revolutionary times to the present day, with an emphasis on Indiana's involvement and many significant contributions. Definitely an informative, entertaining, and humbling experience. If you have any interest in history, this is a DO NOT MISS experience.",

   "A unique treasure hidden in plain sight. This downtown landmark is chock full of historically important and rare exhibits and artifacts. The auditorium is a one of a kind look into a bygone era. Crafted in ways with materials that just aren't available today. Well worth a visit!"

   "Beautiful spacious park\n Great trails in a wooded area along with acres of lush lawn . Cool playground. Something for everyone,  including 4 legged furry family members.  It's spread out so every area has it's own purpose,  not jammed into a small amount of land",
   "Clean well landscaped park. Plenty of trails in the woods. I had no idea this park was here till we stumbled upon it",
   "Great location. Fun park for all. Good play areas. Nice parking. Great walk, jog, bike, and dog walk park!",
   "Took my two pit bull puppies and the family here a couple of time this summer. Loved the trail and the paths. Nice place to go if you don't want to be bothered with loose or unattended dogs or children for that matter lol.",
   "My favorite place in the city! Been visiting since childhood and it's always a pleasure. Please go! You will love it!"

   "Came here for my husband's birthday with our kids, age 10 and 7. We had a blast! The kids didnt want to leave. We did the Alice in wonderland room. It was age appropriate but still challenging, even for us adults. This was our first escape room experience so we did have to ask for more clues than I would like to admit. The hints were subtle enough to help you but not too much to take away from the challenge. So this is a great place for beginners and frequent escape room lovers. The staff were understanding and explained everything. \nI booked our slot the same day and had no troubles navigating their website. Customer service was out of this world. I really felt welcomed and comfortable with our visit. I would recommend them to anyone looking to build confidence in your relationships to someone looking to kill time.",
   "Absolutely LOVED this! Our first time and won't be the last! We played the Alice and Wonderland themed room. \n\nOur ages ranged from 11yrs old to 40's, all being able to participate. \n\nThe reviews for this place are all amazing and a huge reason why we went to this escape room.\n\n This is totally worth the money and such a great experience. The details in the the rooms were incredible and the staff were so funny, friendly, and helpful.\n\n I could go on and on about this place!!!! Totally a must on your \"things to-do\" list!\ud83d\ude01",
   "This place is amazing! We have done many escape rooms and this is by far our new favorite place to go! The staff is very nice, engaging, and accommodating! The rooms are great! You really feel like you are in the environment of the room! We will be coming back to do every single room they have!",
   "Twisted Room Escapes is one of the best escape rooms in Indianapolis. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The waiting lobby has a lot of fun activities to pass the time. Our group did the submarine room (we heard this is the most difficult room) and it was a perfect blind of challenge, plenty of puzzles for everyone to work on at the same time, and the attention to detail in the room was amazing. Our game moderator was awesome. She did a great job of helping us along when we needed it but also let us figure out most things on our own. We got out with just 17 seconds left! We will definitely be coming back to try all the other rooms.",
   "We did the Submarine room with 4 people and barely made it out in time! So fun and challenging. The staff was amazing & helpful, clues well designed to 'nudge' you without giving it away, and the payoff was my favorite (epic music) and made me feel like a WINNER! Go to Twisted Room if you want to have a great time and stretch your mind!"

My husband and I had a Great time. He went a lot as a kid, so he was showing me around while also being pleasantly surprised by new additions since he had last been years ago.",

   "Beautiful land, amazing fun to do with the family. We went on my daughters field trip in the fall and it was just gorgeous. Neat to walk through and have fun while learning at the same time. A picturesque day!",
   "Great place to take your kids all year round inside or out they get things inside to see plus in the summertime see how people used to do pioneer age before gas-electric phones are they even invented how they used to do things back then some people still do it that way today and technologies or flop people do not keep the technology they refuse to use it but this is a good place to take your kids all year roundChick-fil-A hours and so he could have a really good place in the good place to eat to",
   "I haven't been here since I was a kid, but I recently saw that they were having a free admission day. My boyfriend, kids, and I had a blast. The kids were super excited to explore and learn. We especially loved Benjamin in the makesmith workshop. He was so helpful with the boys and they loved using all the tools."

   "One of the most beautiful places in Indianapolis. The park is always a great place to bike and run. There are events going on here pretty regularly as well. If you want a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Indy daily life and need nature in your life this is your place.",
   "Excellent play structure, reminds my girls of a castle which they love. The spray grounds in the summer time are a nice addition. Usually busy. Parking lot available. I wish there were a few more benches and shady areas. Other wise it is a nice park.",
   "A wonderful place to go for your walks and enjoy nature of all kinds. I was there in March and saw deer at the side of the road.  They have a large playground and open area for all your outdoor activities. There is a great nature center at this park. Check them out sometime soon.",
   "We visited this place in September. Very nice people here, we came for the horse riding experience. As others have pointed out: it IS just basically sitting on a horse while it walks the path. That doesn't diminish from the experience I don't think, because that's what they tell you it is. Don't expect to have freedom with their horses. It isn't your pet.\nWe had lots of fun here, and it was an extremely pleasant day. Kudos to the whole team at this place!",
   "Long trails and a large hill for sledding, limited bird population which was quite surprising for a park of that size. Very large areas throughout to enjoy, nice kids area with a slide built into a hill. Great location for taking your family or for an enjoyable walk, run, or bike."

   "As a wedding photographer, I couldn't recommend Garfield Park Conservatory enough for clients looking for a small intimate ceremony or elopement. My clients planned their wedding quickly from Florida, and the conservatory was quite helpful and responsive to them as they planned long distance in three weeks' time. Garfield Park was even willing to let us come an hour before their ceremony to capture their wedding portraits in the greenhouse, and with the perfect March day outside, we were able to capture some stunning photos outside on their property as well. \n\nThe conservatory provides that beautiful greenery feel, especially useful during the cooler months of the year in Indiana. While the space doesn't accommodate many guests, this couple's family gathered around the space and celebrated when these two became husband and wife. \n\nAgain, hands down this is a great venue for those looking for a small intimate setting for their wedding ceremony.",
   "Beautiful space to spend some time during bad weather. Many beautiful plants, flowers and trees. Couple peaceful waterfalls to sit down for a break. Looking forward to going back and checking out the sunken garden when it\u2019s warmer.",
   "Small but compact. Plants are thriving and in bloom! Gorgeous moss covered waterfall with a lily pad koi pond. Ooo. Seems like it\u2019s be a divine venue for a wedding.",
   "A hidden gem! Cheap admission and a wonderful variety of plants. Take a tropical respite at this beautiful Conservatory. Don't forget to also visit the art center! Definitely my favorite park in Indianapolis!",

   "Matt H. was our guide and this experience was awesome. Totally recommend it!",
   "Really love doing escape room. This time we did a really hard one, didn't feel like there was enough time to since all the puzzles and proceed to the next level. Unfortunately another group got added to our group to full the room to max capacity.. Which was too many people. There were people standing around unable to participate and it was too crowded. Otherwise the rooms are unique and challenges are different. I highly recommend it. Especially with people you know."

Benjamin Harrison v signing the declaration of Independence, William Henry Harrison serving as our ninth president (briefly), and of course Benjamin Harrison serving one term between the two Grover Cleveland administrations.",

There\u2019s also a few areas which are roped off but the employees explain to you that the museum is interactive except for the roped off areas. There\u2019s interactive screens which tell you about the instruments and two awesome studio spaces you can drum on and change the venue with buttons. Love, love, loved it here and highly recommend it.",

They need to get in with the state museum or supplement the experience with something else. BUT, the drum heads and cymbals on the drum sets you can play are ultra cool because they are SO quiet! You could jam on them in an apartment!",
   "Visited Indy so many times and didn't realize this place existed.  I started drumming a couple of years ago, but whether a beginner, expert or someone who never played before in their life, this place is a great way to spend an hour or two.  Pretty much anything you can hit to make a sound (including giant cymbals, wood blocks and more) as well as classic drum kits (and even one made out of Lego) are here. And much of it you can have a.go on!"

That was the stuff that kinda \u201chits home\u201d and gave me creepy feels. Loved the medicine bottles! Neat neat neat.",
   "A nice activity for an hour, I recommend this museum for anybody who can stomach it. It's not gross but there are things (like brains, child skeleton, etc) that might not suit everyone. Our guide was nice and I felt she let us explore the rooms with adequate timing. $10 to get in and they have a small parking lot northwest of the building. Small but with enough parking. We walked up to the steps 2 min before the hour and were let in after she unlocked the door. They accept credit card. Very informative tour! I will definitely be coming back with visitors!!",
   "This place was fascinating! Our guide Doug, was so knowledgeable and it was really nice to read the humanizing stories that went along with the specimens. So many neat things to see and beautiful old furniture and history. 10/10 would recommend.",
   "Very interesting tour!!! Would definitely do again to see all the unique items! The ladies conducting the tours and greeting you are amazing and knowledgeable about the history of the museum and able to answer questions and provide a good history lesson all while having a good time! Thank you ladies for a great visit!",
   "This museum has tours that last almost exactly one hour. It is the cheapest museum I have ever been to. With probably the most knowledgeable hosts of any museum I've ever been to. Now they can't answer all of your questions, but if they can't then they usually write it down and find someone who can cuz that's exactly what they did to me when I went here a year ago. I took a friend here just the other day and it was just as awesome of an experience. They've got the stories of the patients, not just the medical descriptions. This place could very easily entertain you for days on end, and it truly saddens me that the tours can only be one hour long. I also recommend going there over the summer because the medical garden is also very interesting. They've got every plant in there labeled with common name, scientific name,"

The landscape designer was the same man who later designed and developed Central Park in NY. I happened to arrive on a Friday when the Lily house has free tours (2 pm). The house was the country house of the Lily family and it was marvelous to stroll through to see their furnished home with libraries, secret doors, game rooms, and even the garage with a vintage car inside. The gardens took hours for me to wander through. They were setting up on the lawn for a wedding as I left. Beautiful place.",

   "Gorgeous in the spring and summer.  Free admission with Zoo admission.  This garden is the gem of Indianapolis.  It's not only beautiful and well maintained, they have an indoor butterfly \"garden\" as well.  In the gardens there are nice, picturesque almost private little nooks to rest in, a big beauful space for weddings, fountains, ponds, water lilies, a zillion different flower species and some whimsical animal statuettes.  At first I felt the whimsy was out of place.  The next time I went, I really looked at them and they are fun and one particularly hilarious statuette of 3 ducks walking on the edge of a pond and the middle duck is expounding with his wing, and looks like he wants to push that duck into the water.  This one gave me the biggest laugh!  This place is definitely a must-see in Indianapolis!",
   "Gorgeous gardens. I thourghly enjoyed myself. Took several pictures that friends now use as screen savers on their computer. Also took pictures for artistic muse. Just lovely.",
   "I enjoyed the indoor garden. The outside garden did not look in a great shape. Maybe because it was around Christmas time and some of the plants were dead/in a bad shape!",
   "This is a really nice indoor and outdoor garden. We went after we went to the zoo and it was a nice way to wind down. The butterfly garden is really cool. The outdoor area is really awesome. It feels like an old fashioned British outdoor garden. You get in free with zoo tickets I think.",
   "Nice scenery with green and blue environment in Indy downtown. Good place to exercise and spend an evening. Well maintained. Connected to white river and Indy zoo. Garden looks but antique but clam and quite place to relax. The butterfly arenas are worth to enjoy."

   "Wonderful grounds for walking. The path is dirt, but easy enough to walk on. Although this winter the conditions dont allow for a full lake loop, I enjoyed what I could.\n\nThe art installations throughout are neat and creative. Come and see for yourself!",
   "Winter Lights were beautiful. Kids did OK on that cold day. Would have been nice to go without kids and tour the buildings more thoroughly, but it was still a great family activity. We'll try to return next year.",
   "Very well done walking tour. Dress warm but you can always stop for hot chocolate. It is an affordable date night, family outing or just a great experiential gift idea.  Could also be considered to be a romantic experience.  \nStart a tradition.  Go.",
   "Very nice collection, helpful staff and solid events and tours.  Well worth regular visits if you live here or one visit if you're a tourist.",
   "This is great place for a nature walk. There was many areas to explore and see. We visited the guest center to cool off in the AC and watch the wildlife from the comfort of indoors, which helped us recharged to keep exploring out in the heat. We really enjoyed the trails. \n\nIf this review was helpful please hit the thumbs up! Thanks!"

There is a zoo however it wasn't open when we pass by. Maybe it was a little early in the morning. But the canal and river area are both very beautiful.",

Include some pictures from the state fair that's held in Indianapolis right outside of Indianapolis, Indiana. The city, and area businesses, along with the entire Indianapolis, Indiana Community have come together and made a beautiful, welcoming, and unique downtown area. They have horse-drawn carriage, to peddling beer bars smiley. :-) :-)",

   "Julia was a great instructor! Had such a fun time at Go Ape! Definitely a work out and need some upper body strength at times. You can get through the course without much physical endurance, but can\u2019t be too out of shape. It\u2019s fun being up in the trees. They care a lot about safety, too, and will always be paying attention making sure you\u2019re doing things right! They\u2019re also doing waivers electronically which rocks!",
   "Took my cousin to GoApe as a last adventure of summer right before she starts up school again.  We went on a weekday morning, so it wasn't crowded at all.  Even though it was warm out, it was shady in the trees and they had lots of water available at stations on the ground.  Cabin manager and instructors were very friendly and helpful.  You start out at a lower training site that way you feel safe once in the higher trees.  At the first long zip line she was a bit nervous, but by the end of the course they were her favorite part.  Go Ape is a great way to get outside and try something different.",
   "So much fun! My family went and we had such a great time. The ladies there were so helpful, even setting up a brake line for grandma! Even though it rained they gave us a quick rain check that we can't wait to use!",
   "I got over my fear of heights here. That's why I went. The first course was hard for me but by the time I got to the fifth course, I wanted more! \n\nI brought my son and daughter with me. Both enjoy video games and hisss at the sunlight. So, really, I FORCED my son and daughter to go with me. They ended up having fun too! It was actually nice to be outside and have them put the electronics down. Parents: kids telling you \"no, I don't want to go\" will eventually learn to have fun here by the second course.\n\nTwo birds, one stone. Having the kids outside wins by a long shot but conquering a fear is also awesome.",
   "Wow! This was awesome! Friendly and informative staff.  Clean and we'll run facility.  The training was detailed and I felt safe.  Staff patrol the area to be sure of safety and help with any questions.  If taking kids (only 10 and above!) be sure to check the height requirement as well. Also, I would ask for one of the guides to train the kids separate from the group to be sure they are focused!!!!"

   "Nice evening with the kids on our first visit. The facility is clean and well maintained. The racing area is not air conditioned, but was not too hot on a warm afternoon. The main area, with comfortable places to sit and relax, is air conditioned. It looked like there are a few rooms to revert for parties or team building exercises. I enjoyed the racing memorabilia and many pictures of past Indy 500 winners. The facility has food, a pool table, air hockey, and a couple video games. \n\nVery fun when it was just me and a few of my kids in the track.",
   "We had a great time here.  Clean, fun environment.  Kids had a blast.  The top speed of the carts is controlled by the staff.  They kept it slow for the first few laps until our kids got the hang of it, then they turned it up a little bit.  I would say this is a real workout for the forearms!  If we\u2019re in the area again we will definitely visit.",
   "Great place and great experience! the building is in great condition and granted, the karts are all electric it is nice to not have the smell of gas burning your nostrils. Still quick little buggies and the prices have cool swag grabs, i got 3 races and a t-shirt for me and my girlfriend for under$120. Got a great memory and a cool shirt",
   "Nice, clean place.  Air conditioned in the main area. Not in the racing area.  They have a pool table, air hockey table, and some video games.  There are areas to sit and hang out and two nice party rooms to rent out.  The whole place is decked out with Indy 500 race deco.  It's pretty cool!",

It's a very popular place for them and although most are respectful, there are a few who ride dangerously, and on paths clearly marked \"no bicycles\". More than once we've walked our small dogs here and have almost been hit by these people. They look at you rudely as they whizz by you like you're the cause of the problem. Absolutely ridiculous.....",

Not just a flat trail either, lots of changes in elevation and a river running through. It has a sizable playground next to the parking lot. This park is near us and they have a great recycling set up, so we bring our recycling here as well."

They stay in character and represent the people they are playing so well.   I really start thinking I am talking to the people.    I did a bit of research on Madame Walker before I went and had some things I was curious about.   In asking the question have to remember they will pretty much only respond to what happened in 1915 and prior.    There are also guides who can help you with questions after the time frame.    Every one of the You Are There series I have seen has been excellent.",

He was pretty versed on religion as well as Indiana history. We were also given a little lesson on how they preserve old Indiana manuscripts-fairly fascinating.",

The concept of time machines to transport you back to a space in time was as much fun for the adults and it was for children. The actors were very knowledgeable on anything you could thing to ask them. The architecture of the building is also very special. It has strong character but immediately, you feel like all ages are welcome and encouraged to \u201cplay\u201d.",

They also have a lovely illustration on how conservation is done most effectively. The historical context in exhibits and the curation are top-notch. The programming is great and the staff knowledgeable and friendly."

The architecture is absolutely stunning and we got to see where the different laws get passed. Great family experience and the tour guide kept it interesting for our daughters.\n\nIndiana has the longest running Supreme Court building in the country... 130 years",
   "This is another architectural landmark in the USA.  This beautiful building is the Indiana State Capitol or the Statehouse located in the heart of downtown Indianapolis.  This 4 floor building was built in 1888 and houses all executive offices, the Indiana State Senate, the Indiana House of Representatives, and the Indiana State Supreme Court.  \n\nAbout almost 100 years after it was built, the building went through a major renovation in 1986 for the Centennial Celebration two years later in an effort to restoring or recreating the original design.  \"Four acres of plaster walls and ceilings were stripped, painted, and decorated.  1,500 gallons of paint were used. 124,500 square feet of interior marble and limestone were cleaned. 4.25 acres of Indiana limestone were cleaned on the exterior of the building.  31.5 miles of mortar joints were cut and repointed on the exterior limestone. 2,920 two-feet-square pieces of marble floor, approximately 1.1 miles in length, were removed and replaced for the installation of new electrical wiring. 45,000 board feet of white oak were used in woodwork, equivalent to 85 average trees. This included eight sets of white oak monumental entrance doors. 40 original brass chandeliers were restored and 67 were replicated.",
   "Majestic architecture, historic downtown setting.",
   "Happy to have taken the time to stop by here. What better thing to do than to learn about the history of the city you're vacationing in? This was really breath-taking, I'm not surprised there's over thousands of pictures of this pleasantly-aesthetic building. Surprisingly spent most of our time here in their library section where law books as well as anything historic were available for public use. The lady who worked there was so kind as to tell us a bit of history. Interesting fact: Only the chandelier lights on the fourth floor were authentic, while the rest are re-mastered replicates!",

Probably gets pretty muddy and they don't want you riding in that, but I understand.",
   "Anything by the White River is great, but this place is a true gem.  I only got to walk a bit of it, but I am bringing my bike to explore some more for sure next time."

   "All great but the Garden Club ruins the atmosphere by giving the ok to drive all over the park and use it for a parking lot. Food trucks every week under trees and damaging roots! There is a parking lot and Football field meant for high use. Really Rude. Disrespectful to the nature areas and the adjacent neighbors.",

We didn't bother calling the police because there was no need to because they'll never find it anyway. Suggest to everyone they not carry a purse with them to the park or anything of value. Was snatched right off the picnic table."

   "I've been here only twice in the past 2 years. I should visit more often when I'm in Indy! Food here is always excellent. Sure, I probably couldn't recite back everything that was in it, but it always meshes well together. Highly recommended!",
   "One of the best dining experiences my wife and I have ever had...each time we go.  Have not had a bad dish, nor a bad cocktail at this establishment.  The atmosphere is busy, but it's a small space that gives you an excellent meal and overall experience.  Thanks for bringing high quality food, drink and service to Indy!",
   "Their crafted cocktails were very delicious we sampled a lot of different ones while there. I had the Reverend Palmer, Buffalo Trace with lemon and angostura. A lovely sweetish version of a Manhattan. So smooth, loved it.\n I picked to eat off of the Savor Menu: Beet Salad, Rigatoni , Buttermilk Bread Pudding.\nMy sister and friend ate the Savor menu with the Salmon. My brother-in-law had the octopus on toast. All of the food was wonderfully crafted the flavors were delicious portion sizes just right. I really enjoyed the ingredients in the beet salad I hope they make that a part of their regular options. It took a really long time for us to get our dessert from the prefix menu. That was the only disappointing part of our experience, having to wait so long for a desert.",
   "Great food. We had wings and a tuna sandwich. The wings were very good but I was skeptical of the tuna sandwich at a strip mall bar but let me tell you, it was EXCELLENT. The bartender was nice and had good customer service skills. It's a fun place with lots of locals. Great place for a rainy evening after we finished shopping.",
   "Great place! Food was great and innovative. Service was very attentive! Definitely a must-go when in Indy."

   "Another Indy Gem!\n\nWhat a great experience. From the select list of local cocktails to an exceptional menu which is served with almost flawless service and attention.\n\nEven though we did not have a reservation, after a decent wait, we were seated with typical charming mid-western hospitality.\n\nThe Pork Belly was truly exceptional. But please don't get this is you are not into very bold, very rich, intense flavors. If you are into this, then this is executed to perfection.\n\nThis is definitely a cozy place with some tight quarters but well worth it. \n\nWill definitely be going back to try other items on the menu.",
   "Excellent place for a variety of fresh food. Delicious seasonal cocktails. The hamburger and pork belly are appropriately portioned and flavorful. Dishes are great for sharing so you can try many things. It is fairly small so make reservations. Wait staff is attentive and welcoming.",
   "Amazing food and service! We especially loved the raw oyster appetizer, pork belly entree, and monkey bread dessert. The mignonette on the oysters was perfectly balanced. The pork belly was crispy, slightly spicy, and full of umami flavor. The monkey bread was buttery and sweet with a cinnamon flavor. Our server was attentive and had several suggestions since it was our first time dining there.\n\nThe only dish we didn\u2019t absolutely love was the chicken and caviar. The hoecake was a bit dry and could\u2019ve used some more sauce. The caviar seemed like an afterthought and the flavor of it was overpowered by the fried chicken. That being said, the fried chicken itself was AMAZING. Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside...one of the best pieces of fried chicken thighs I\u2019ve had. We\u2019ll definitely be returning!",
   "Had an AMAZING dinner here! Loved the touch of the Tinker Toast to start off the meal. Each dish we had was delicious \u2014 we were so sad we couldn\u2019t try dessert, too (had to make a pick up at the airport). The service was great, the food was better, and the ambiance was spot on. Even though we were seated outside, it was covered, adequately heated, and they provided a fleece blanket. Will definitely come back here when I visit again!",
   "Love this place.  Service is always outstanding and the food is consistent and delicious.  I love the fact that you can now make reservations.  The wine list is reasonably priced compared to the lame, chain steakhouses in Indianapolis.  A complimentary shot of sparkling wine before your meal is always a plus."

   "Great place for lunch! Go early so you won't ruin your dinner because you will have to get the shrimp cocktail and plenty of food to follow. Fantastic service and white table cloth tables for lunch. If the sliders are offered it is a great way to get a sampling of multiple tastes on one plate.  The French onion soup tastes like it should when served by a kitchen that has great beef available for the stock. Served in a crock with plenty of crusty topped cheese. Beginning to end a wonderful experience for all your senses.",
   "We love Harry & Izzy's because even though the atmosphere is laid back, the service is still \"high end\" thanks to polite, friendly, capable, uniformed staff.  The location is easy to get to.  Easily find your own parking or use the valet.  And the food is friggin' delicious.  I could eat nothing but the slab bacon appetizer and be perfectly happy.  Harry & Izzy's has become our anniversary tradition every September.  The kids love it just as much as my wife and I do.",
   "An Indianapolis institution.  Try your best to get a meal in here during any trip to the city, and always (always!) start off with a Shrimp cocktail. If you have any eaters who don't enjoy a weighty hunk of beef, the non-steak options here, such as the prime rib pizza, are also great.",
   "Absolutely divine. Cannot wait to go back again. It can get a little loud, but the atmosphere is so eclectic and it makes you feel as if you've gone back in time! The service and staff are so kind and welcoming and extremely helpful when you can't decide what goodness to eat! Absolute treat.",
   "Harry & Izzy's is a wonderful spot. My boyfriend and I brought our families here for them to meet each other and they gave us a private room without evening having to ask. We had the best time and the servers were outstanding. The lunch special steak sliders were delicious. We'll be back."

I enjoyed the trout with crab on top and my husband enjoyed the steak. He said they may be the best steak he had tasted! Our server, Calvin, was superb. The food was perfectly flavorful and we both left feeling full. We were both happy with our wine and the wine selection is amazing. We made reservations and enjoyed the ease of coming in with our table ready for us.",
   "Step back in time to an old school high end steak house. The service is amazing. The steaks are fantastic too. But the star is the famous shrimp cocktail with ho.e made sauce. They fresh grind fresh horse radish daily and the kick of heat from the sauce will make you tear up. A must try if you are in Indy!",
   "Very expensive. \n\nSteak was tender but dry and had no flavor. My wife's chicken was very good. \n\nThe steak was not worth the $60 a person in my opinion. Jumbo shrimp and cocktail sauce was good but again $2 per piece of shrimp was too high priced for my taste buds.\n\nNice atmosphere, very clean, quick friendly service, wait staff in tuxedos when we walked in should have been my clue it was going to be way more than I would typically spend.",
   "There are a lot of great steak houses in this world but St. Elmo is definitely one of them. Wonderful food in a wonderful atmosphere served by professionals is always a winning combination. I always get a shrimp cocktail to clean my sinuses before enjoying the veal chop with grilled onions.  Have never had a bad experience or regret over how much I spent which is always a lot!",
   "Good steak house but I've had better. Got the new York strip steak and its not as tender as I'm used to. Just it was still very good and cooked perfectly (I ordered medium). The famous shrimp cocktail is VERY heavy on the horseradish so be ready for that. Ordered the black berry Moscow mule, not enough ginger beer but still pretty good."

   "My husband and I visited Indy for the first time and our hotel recommend Nada but under sold it as just a taco place. I'm glad we went for it! We ordered the chips and salsa trio which includes mild, medium and spicy salsas. I'm not typically a spicy salsa girl but this was one of the best salsas I've ever tried. I'm still trying to figure out if I can replicate it at home. \n\nFor the entrees, I ordered the braised chicken enchiladas. I loved the presentation in the cast iron skillet and the surprise of couscous. It had the right amount of heat and creaminess. My husband orders steak fajitas at every Mexican restaurant we visit. The beef was tender and full of flavor. His only complaint was he wanted more of the poblano peppers and less liquid in the skillet. Although he would have preferred flour tortillas (there were out at 8 pm on a Sunday, totally understandable), the corn tortilla were the perfect size and tasted great.",
   "Nada is a small upbeat downtown Mexican restaurant.  It serves authentic dishes in just the right portion with aesthetic presentation. The ambiance is contemporary  yet has a definite south of the border vibe. The wait staff although young, were efficient and accommodating. We were served promptly and the food was delicious.  Everyone was a fan of the homemade guacamole which we eagerly shared with the freshly made corn tortilla chips. My grandson recommended it, and we all liked it well enough that we plan to return. There is free on the street parking, although you may have to circle the block a time or two. Try it, you will agree, their food is on point!",
   "Food was incredible. Get the pork belly tacos, you won\u2019t regret it. Everything we tried was delicious, including the dessert. Ambiance was lovely- great place for a date, though we went as a family to meet up with an in-town relative. Manager Steve was attentive and kind. Would definitely go again!",
   "Have been here twice and the food has been great both times. Very cool environment, staff is pretty friendly. Pastor tacos are excellent as well as the Asian tacos (forget the name). My wife had a salad that she loved but the plate it came on was way way too small. Very awkward to eat. Otherwise, love this place.",
   "Very pleased with service and meal. I wasn\u2019t quite sure about cuisine but was pleasantly surprised. I had the steak fajita and was the best I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m not a fan of beans but theirs was very good. Thank you for a great experience!"

Perfect for if you\u2019re wanting to do a quarantine date night. They wrapped the food so it wouldn\u2019t spill in the car and stayed warm. They do deliver in the Broad Ripple Area as well.",
   "My boyfriend took me here for Valentines dinner. I had never tried this restaurant before and was so excited when I found out we were going here. The waiters were so friendly and checked in on us frequently enough that I never had my drink empty. The wine was delicious and the food was amazing! Definitely will be coming back here for another special occasion.",
   "Really disappointed. We were recommended MC\u2019s multiple times and were so excited to try it. Just got a carry out order of Chicken Lasagna, Buffalo Mozzarella, and eggplant spaghetti(can\u2019t remember the name). None of it tasted good. $54 later and we didn\u2019t finish any of it. Really really bummed out because I was so excited for this after all of the great reviews. Even the salad was watery. Currently eating cereal. I wanted this to be our Italian spot!",
   "There's a reason this place is busy throughout the week. The food is delicious and the place is lovely. It's also much bigger than I thought and it was still packed. Great spot for special occasion dinners. The food does take time though so make sure you get an appetizer so you're not famished by the time your mains arrive.",
   "Was recommended by a friend after searching high and low for some edible Italian food in Indianapolis.  Lo and behold, it does exist!  Most of the other places can't even cook proper spaghetti and Mama Carolla's can compete with the best of them in New York.  They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait, but it is so worth it (and you'll be salivating by the time they seat you, the smells are so good).  I had the manicotti and my dad had the chicken picatta.  I'm always a pasta person, and I wish I'd gotten the chicken, so tender and lemony it was.  And the building itself is so charming and feels like it could be in the Italian countryside if you don't look too closely."

Then to not mention we was pushed to a terrible seating and we was not happy but we rolled with it. But I think for $200... I could have went to a better place for better food. But our waiter and his helper helped us stay. I really hate to leave this \nPost but for spending that kind of money I expected better food not mention we wanted porterhouse for 2 and they was out. Come one they should have known.",
   "Amazing experience. From the waiters to the manager who would occasionally check in and the kitchen staff, everything went wonderfully. The Lobster Mac and cheese is awesome and it's so much it feed a table of three. And the cheesecake was amazing as well. All in All 10/10. Can't wait for next time",
   "Lined their pockets with $20 million of taxpayer money intended to bail out small businesses. Shamelessly. Order quarantine takeout from someone who didn\u2019t get that money. And also someone who is steaks aren\u2019t as dry and bland.",
   "Birthday Dinner was outstanding. Kendall, Justice and Victoria took care of us. I would dare say this was the complete experience- not just a meal. Enjoy",
   "Our server Victoria made the night the best it could have been. Three of the four of us that went had never been. She fully explained everything to us and even helped us narrow down what we wanted. The food was AMAZING! The steak was so tender it almost melted in your mouth. The lobster mac and cheese was the die for!! Price was very expressive but well worth the food!(:"

A very nice deal is the menus include \"popular\" item markings and rightfully so, as that's all we ordered and it was delicious. Reservations recommended to avoid sitting on an awkward waiting list.",
   "They got us in for a dinner reservation on Valentine's day for the same night. They stayed open past their usual hours so couples could continue to enjoy themselves. The wait staff and chefs are very knowledgeable about allergies and they have some specific allergy-friendly menus. The management came by at the end and was very receptive to some ideas about allergy free desserts they could carry. The valet was incredibly pleasant and eager, even on a busy night while out in the freezing cold. All around great experience!!!",
   "We had a larger private dining experience at Seasons 52 and they did not disappoint. We were very late but their team was so incredible! Taylor Wright was awesome to work with. She was meticulous and was super helpful in planning everything - from the menu to the invoice - everything was great. We also had 2 amazing servers - Mark and Andy. They were awesome! They took care of us and went above and beyond.

Our reservation was for 1:00 pm and we didn\u2019t get our food until 2:05. The young lady who was our waitress was very nice but I was very disappointed in the service we received.",

I cannot wait to go back, and that's not even taking into account how delicious the food was. I found myself trying to decide between 3 different entrees, and the waiter (Gregory) suggested the sausage and peppers.

The amount of food is reasonable for the price, and the quality is top-notch. Their ingredients are obviously high quality and make even the simple menu items taste amazing. It's just simply good! Their omelettes are flavorful and about dang near perfect. Their French toast is heavenly. And their regular cinnamon toast is questionably fantastic......like they have some of secret recipe. Even their little lightly dressed greens are wonderful! And their coffee is some of the best I've had. If I lived closer, I would eat here every day.......for multiple meals. Go out of your way for this place! Totally worth it!",
   "I had the combination half sandwich and half soup.  I opted for the chicken salad sandwich in a croissant and the tomato artichoke soup.  For the side, I chose the chips, which were decent.  My sandwich was quite good on the croissant.  I'm glad I went with it.  My soup was a little on the salty side, but was tasty and very tomatoey, if you know what I mean.  Service was great.  I didn't wait too long for my order to arrive. My waitress was very attentive and friendly.   Also, in terms of the menu, they do have quite a selection to choose from. The normal portion sizes look filling enough as I looked at what other guests around me have ordered.  Overall, my experience was good here.  Worth a try!",
   "My waiter was extremely nice and helpful (Dylan, not sure on the spelling). It has a perfect location of both city viewing and sitting outdoors. I had the Cuban breakfast and it was stellar. I did find out that I could add many things to it and I highly recommend adding another egg and possibly another meat, like bacon or ham. I also consumed the kids French toast meal and that was excellent (especially as a little dessert size for breakfast). The crisp on the edges of the bread was a wonderful touch. My fruit cup consisted of apple, pineapple, strawberry, and orange. The coffee was fresh and delightful. I will definitely be coming back again for at minimum, the breakfast. I can only imagine that lunch would be delectable \ud83d\udc95",
   "The food was amazing, the service was fast didn\u2019t even use all the time at the meter. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed it. The best breakfast your going to get in this area, and bang for your buck. The hot chocolate was A+. We are energized to take on the day. We will be back for sure."

   "This place is simply amazing!  I\u2019d never had anything like it. It starts off with an amazing salad bar, but don\u2019t get too full!  There\u2019s a parade of people marching around with every kind of grilled meat you can think of! It\u2019s never ending. Drinks too!  This is one of the most unique and fun places I\u2019ve ever eaten at!  I think it\u2019s time to come back!",
   "Went for the first time during Devour Indy and it was amazing! Our server Shaun was outstanding and very attentive. The cuts of meat that we got were always cooked to perfection! We unfortunately didn't get to taste all the options that were available, but what we did get was outstanding. The cocktails also very well made! Definitely will be back!",
   "Excellent food and experience.  The salad bar in itself would be a great meal.  So many  healthy items, but the table service with all of the delicious meats was my favorite.  Had reservations for 5 p.m. when they opened for dinner and was seated and eating within 15 minutes. I will definitely return!",
   "Went here for my husband's birthday with friends and mother in law. Had great service the first 20 minutes there and was constantly asked if we had been helped and ordered. Friends showed up 25 minutes late and we were never revisited by the waitress for refills OR to ask our friends what they wanted to order and drink. An employee making drinks at a rolling bar asked us if we wanted a special drink and we said yes and also if our friends could get a water glass at the very least. They were only served the mixed drink and never brought anything else. The chips you flip over for more food were already at the table so they got to eat food but no drinks for them. Zero stars for service but 2 for the food since it actually was great. The steaks were the only  good part of it.  Sides and salsd bar were not seasoned and old.",
   "We went for our anniversary dinner and they gave us a free dessert with happy anniversary written on it. Lovely place for a romantic dinner. \n\nOnly wish the music would have been turned down a bit, so I could hear some of the people bringing the meat around. Still pleased with the overall experience though."

   "Jordan provided outstanding performance, if not, The Capital Grille may have received only two stars.\n\nThe best serving was the appetizer.  A nicely done sauce but the shrimp and the bread were both over cooked and difficult to cut even with a butter knife.\n\nThe lobster bisque was average at best and lacked flavor.\n\nThe medium rare steak was more rare than medium. The lobster lacked flavor.\n\nThe cream spinach was so overly salted we sent it back.  We were told that the chef agreed that it was over salted and asked if we wanted something else.   We were puzzled that the chef didn\u2019t taste it before it left the kitchen.\n\nThey did have a nice stirring stick that was covered with sugar crystals that was very creative.\n\nThe cream and strawberries were ok.\n\nAt the expense we probably will look elsewhere on our next trip as we were disappointed with the cuisine.  Once again, the service was fantastic but the culinary experience was lacking.",
   "This restaurant is so good. It's definitely pricey however the service from the moment we walked in the door, to when we left was exceptional. The dessert was amazing\ud83d\ude0d. I suggest to park in the mall garage and save on valet parking, it's just a short walk. My husband and I went here for our anniversary and they set up our table with rose petals. \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f It truly made our evening special. Thanks Capitol Grille for making our night perfect.",
   "This place is awesome. My first time visiting. At first glance at prices I thought \"a little pricey\". But portions were large and the food was excellent.  We also loved the Burbon.  We will visit again for sure.  Next time we must save room for dessert.  Also the restaurant was extremely clean and the ambiance was perfect.  Highly recommended!!!",
   "Pricey. Good service and good food. Wide variety of patrons. Dress code varies but majority were nice shirt jeans some men added a blazer but not all. Call for a reservation if you want a booth. Good for date night especially if you add a staycation with attached Conrad Hilton.",
   "This is one of the better Capital Grille\u2019s I\u2019ve been to. Service was outstanding and incredibly attentive. The ahi tuna was prepared to perfection. The soy glazed Brussels sprouts were also exceptional."

   "Holy cow \u2014 that cinnamon roll French toast! All the sweet breakfast options I\u2019ve tried here are truly amazing. From the nutty monkey cakes to the red velvet French toast, they\u2019re all rich, decadent and delicious. There\u2019s even a featured sweet cake that changes regularly. I also appreciate that you can have real maple syrup (for a charge) which is pretty rare. Sweet breakfasts are clearly their main thing.\n\nYet there\u2019s still plenty of options to enjoy a healthier breakfast here. Any of the scrambles or the HUGE omelets can be made with egg whites. And there\u2019s a great variety of veggies to add in to their dishes. \n\nAgain, they have lots of delicious fresh juices, though they\u2019re a bit pricey. Their regular brewed coffee is not great, though it gets the job done. \n\nWe typically sit at the bar where we like interacting with the staff. Even when the place is very busy, they\u2019re always friendly.",
   "I\u2019ve ordered from Yolk before, usually on the circle, and it is always good quality. However, with the current situation, I am ordering online and the prices are astronomical. To build your own omelet, it\u2019s $18.50! It costs extra to add meat, it cost extra to add cheese, it cost extra to add a side of anything (fruit, potatoes, etc). Is the quality good? Yes. Is it worth spending almost $20 for an omelette? No. I decided to go with cheaper options in the city. First Watch, Wild Eggs, and Metro Diner are cheaper and just as good with more unique options.",
   "I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve had such a pleasant experience having breakfast! Everyone greeted us as we came in and showered us with attention - this is an unusual experience in Indy where customer service is not a priority. Lots of smiles. An old friend I worked with in the past \nwas our server and he was wonderful: knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food. When you go, ask for James. \nAnd an excellent menu! Who knew there were so many ways to have breakfast? Both sweet and savory items, all of it beautifully prepared and served. Way too much food to eat in one sitting, you will want a to-go box. Worth every penny.",
   "We ordered carry out this morning. I asked for no mushrooms in my omelette, and there were mushrooms. The entire omelette tasted like citrus which was an odd flavor to have while eating eggs. It was most likely because I also chose fruit on the side. The fruit had mold on most of the grapes. I ordered an Iced chai latte. I\u2019ve tried to order it twice now. It seems as if they do not actually know how or do not the have the ingredients to do this because I have ended up with an Iced coffee both times. \n\nMy recommendation is to order simple here. The food is good enough to eat, but trying to do more than eggs and bacon or just pancakes is too hard.",
   "i came here for my birthday while out of town and I've got to say this place is amazing. the red velvet french toast was the best ive ever had. and our waiter was so good and knowledgeable. definitely going to have to try this back in FL."

Up and coming neighborhood out of downtown and worth the visit and supporting places like this! You won't be disappointed.",
   "Generally pretty busy. Expect a wait for weekend brunch. The wait is made easy by a counter where you can order drinks and pastries. The food here is very creative and the atmosphere is pretty darn hip.  It's in a converted mechanics garage. The garage doors with glass panes form the front wall. Cool music playing, excellent vibe from the staff.",

I really enjoyed the restaurant and the atmosphere. My girlfriend had a gluten free chocolate dessert that was also very good. I recommend at least checking this place out for the food alone. If I'm in the area again I'll be back.",
   "What can I say about Milktooth besides it is the most exotic food you can find in the city. They constantly have something new, and are almost always sold out of something because of how delicious it is. Highly recommend!",
   "I used to live in Indy and frequented Milktooth because their food is spectacular. I do not exaggerate when I say it's my favorite breakfast place of all time. I recently was back for the holidays and needed to get my fix. They still got it. Their execution on the dishes is always spot on, inventive, and balanced. It is worth the wait if know good food."

The the food there is tasty and the stuff is welcoming and cooperative. Every time  we eat in this place we have a pleasant time.  I recommend this place with pleasure.",
   "Wife asked me what I wanted to eat. Any chance I can get I choose Lamb. This time I wanted grilled. She searched and found this place. It was my first time to an Istanbul Cafe. I was skeptical after we walked in because we were asked did we have a reservation. We said no. The young lady looked at her book. It was as if she was trying to decide if she wanted us to eat there. Me recognizing the game my reaction was that we would take out. My attitude is always that people can be how they want to be. It's my choice whether or not I want to be part of it. Anyway after fumbling she found us a table close to the exit so I was able to hear if any others were entering without reservations. There were and there was no hesitation to seat them.\n\nThe waiter came forward he seemed hesitant by the look in his eyes but he was efficient. Got appetizers, came quick. Ordered humus and there were two types of egg plant appetizers we couldn't decide so he offered a half-and-half. That was awesome because he didn't have to do that. What was more awesome was the taste and the amount of dishes. So much that we asked for to go boxes. Didn't want to spoil our appetite. Right when he brought the to go boxes the entrees came. Wife had shrimp casserole and side order of spinach. My dish consisted of three medium done lamb chops with red and green bell peppers along with tomatoes. All grilled and excellent.\n\nTo end, we couldn't finish our entrees so yeah to go box was needed for my wife but I finished mine. So good we ordered entrees for each of us  and one for our son to take home. It all totalled one hundred six dollars for five entrees, two appetizers and water. Do the math. Beer and wine was available. We left a tip as we always do. Amount depends on the service and food. I can say the waiter was smiling when we left.\n\nMoral of the story is don't judge a book by its cover.  Most of us want to leave a deserving tip but because of judgement or what you've heard you give us half-a*?! service. So we give you that type of appreciation.",
   "The food is excellent here. I would recommend reservations on the weekend. Thet didn't really have a host taking done names in the lobby. We just waited in an amorphous line for the next group to be called. Nobody knew how long the wait would be. We ended up waiting for about 26 minutes. Not the worst but definitely confusing. Other than that the food and rest of the experience was top notch. (pictured is the appetizer combo)"

I prefer off hours when the crowds aren't so much, but honestly the noise pollution factor isn't the worst here even when they're busier. They manage to be a cozy place in one of the trendiest areas downtown, so chalk another point up for a nice meal. Probably the best turkey meatballs in Indy, too.",
   "I doubt a restaurant with \u201cmeatball\u201d in the title is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear \u201cbrunch\u201d, but I\u2019d invite you to challenge that assumption and switch up your normal brunch routine with Mimi. \n\nThe pancake balls? Just the right amount of sweet, but not so much you feel guilty. Great to share. \n\nThe biscuits and gravy is a fun nod to their typical meatball cuisine, but with a flaky biscuit and perfectly seasoned breakfast sausage instead. \n\nTop it off with a peach mimosa and cup of coffee and you might just have a new go-to brunch place!",
   "I love this place. On a sunny day, grab a seat on the sidewalk. The bread for the subs is fantastically crunchy and chewy. I usually get the classic meatball with Bolognese. Make sure to get the side salad instead of the fries. Also, note to owners, double the size of the side salad that comes with the sub please :)\n\nThe sliders are either great or good but the buns are always fantastic. They are big for sliders and are definitely splittable if you want to try a few combinations!",
   "Decent food, though the meatballs seem to have shrunk since I have been there several years ago. Our family of 4 left with a $120+ bill including a couple of adult drinks and 3 desserts. Not horribly expensive but it's not too cheap for meatballs either. The food is a bit salty (especially the sauces) so you will feel parched at the end of the night after a dinner here. Atmosphere is warm albeit a little on the noisy end. I'd prefer it quieter.",
   "The meatball flights (I will forever call them that) are delicious! Lots of options to mix and match and the meatballs lived up to this Italian meatball stickler's expectations of how meatballs should be. Great job! Will definitely be back!"

Any place that asks you how you would like your salmon cooked and then delivers perfectly has a place in my heart! We had the BLT deviled eggs, grilled salmon, and ooey butter cake for dessert\n\nAmbiance was good - could get loud when full but we had a good level of busyness without too much. We did not have drinks but they all looked good and we will be back to try!",
   "I'll tell ya what, we were so impressed by the food, ambiance, and most importantly the courteous and genuinely helpful suggestions by Rachel L. tonight that it was worth our time to come by twice for food and drinks. Both times, Rachel L. was friendly and kind, she really made our experience an unforgettable one. \n\nFirst course of roasted Brussel sprouts was probably the most delectable way that I've ever had them cooked. So tender, so perfect, slightly sweet, punctuated by crunches of nuts. Oh so yummy! Highly recommend the sprouts.",
   "Food was good. Pictured is smoked turkey salad (no onion). Brussels sprouts HAD fried onions on them (not discussed on the menu). I identified my gluten allergy. So they took the sprouts from the table (rather than letting other 3 people eat some) (even though I tried to stop that). They later brought out remake of the sprouts with rest of meal (after appetizers were long gone), and then still charged full price. At the end of the meal,  we had only tried 3 of the sprouts--they were obviously uneaten. Disappointed when restaurants do stuff like that.",
   "Came here to have dinner before an IRT show. Had the BLT Deviled eggs, got portion to share with two people. Had the Cheesy Chicken Enchilada, what a great taste. Server, Genevieve, was amazing with hospitality and dinning recommendation. Would recommend to anyone in the area to give it a try and ask for Genevieve as your server.

The breading just slipped off. The fried avocado and steamed buns were decent but nothing I\u2019d have to have again, and then finally, the shrimp and toast was just a mix of odd flavors that didn\u2019t mesh well.

   "I was here on a business trip with a colleague and he suggested it. All of our food was very good, our waiter was very personable and offered us suggestions when we told him we were out of town. Our service was good, and the place was clean. If I were back in town I would come again"

   "Came here for a light dinner prior to going across the street for an Indians Baseball game. Good food, drinks and service, nice looking clean place that offers two separate bar areas to hang out in and tv\u2019s everywhere.",
   "Great food and great sports atmosphere!  Comfortable seating and open floor.  Tables have adequate space to move around and not bunched up.  Really enjoy the views of town through the windows.  Ordered an order of pretzels and wings as appetizers and beef short rib sandwich and Reuben sandwich with fries as our entrees.  Great food without the pressure of eating fast.  Took in the Pack and Bears game.  I thought prices we're reasonable for a hotel located dining option.",
   "Our Server John F is the man! Very personable person and a joy too be around! Great at his job and he runs circles around the other staff with ease!!! If i could have a server like this every meal id never eat at home again \ud83d\ude02. Oh yeah Food was good too \ud83d\udc4d",
   "My husband and I were visiting Indianapolis for a convention and stayed in a hotel adjacent to High Velocity. We walked over using the Skywalk from our hotel which was very convenient. High Velocity seated us quickly and our waiter, John, was one of the friendliest people I have ever met in the food service industry! He gave us food recommendations and was prompt with drink refills; but he also went above and beyond and found us a map of things to do in Indianapolis when we mentioned we were visiting from St. Louis. The food was excellent - worth the higher dollar amount. We shared an appetizer of pretzels with beer cheese. The pretzels were soft and fresh and the cheese had a good flavor. I had the salmon plate and subbed sweat potato fries for the rice. The salmon was some of the best salmon I've ever had; tender and flavorful. The asparagus was cooked perfectly - not overdone or mushy. The sweet potato fries were just the right flavor to go with the salmon. My husband had the chicken tenders plate with fries and he said the chicken was fresh and soft; not over-fried or rubbery. The atmosphere was pleasant, especially for a sports bar. It wasn't overly crowded or loud. There were TVs at booths that you could select your channel and volume, but there were also TVs on the walls and pillars to watch if you were placed at a table that didn't have its own TV. Overall, great experience and we would go again."

   "We had an incredible experience here.\n\nFor starters, the pretzel and horseradish mustard were amazing... be aware that the horseradish is VERY intense.\n\nThe stuffed mushrooms were rich and cheesy!\n\nThe potato salad was one of the most flavorful things I've eaten in a long time!\n\nThe bacon wrapped New York strip was... bacon-wrapped - need I say more?!?\n\nAnd the German chocolate cheesecake was mind-boggling delicious.\n\nAdd to this the traditional German atmosphere and you have a place that totally lives up to the hype!",
   "Food is authentic and very good, as is the service. Our German exchange student vouched for the quality and said it was excellent.  You wont leave hungry.  I love this place! Such a unique historical building and location to dine on authentic German cuisine.",
   "Went to watch a couple bands Hot Pockets & Jukebox Luke both were very good! You should catch them anytime they are in town! Was very impressed with the atmosphere, absolutely amazing old building. We've been on the Keto diet but found a great Greek salad on the bar menu & hard liquor with diet coke rounded out the evening! They also a have restaurant with a full menu, food looked good! Parking is the only draw back. All we found was on street parking with meters, but if you circle a time or two someone is always leaving so it doesn't take long to find a spot. Maximum walking distance 1 1/2 to 2 blocks. Well worth the trip!",
   "The Rathskeller biergarten is THE PLACE to be on a weekend night on Mass Ave. The live music goes until 11pm and is always fun.  If you can get there early to claim an outdoor picnic table for your group that is a plus. If you don't have a table, it is still an awesome time.",
   "This is a very nice restaurant. It's really big and sort of underground, but it's no less spectacular and beautiful. Tonight was my first time coming here and they dressed up it for Christmas. Very pretty and romantic. Now, on to the food. Firstly, I strongly warn against the spicy mustard. I thought it was some kind of butter and was very unpleasantly surprised when I tried it with the bread. It made me tear up. Unless you like spicy stuff, then I would strongly advise you to stick with the butter. Other than, the food was very good. They offer both American and German cuisine. I'd recommend going with the German for a truly authentic experience."

I ordered $45 and finished all but still feel like not enough meat, and I actually asked them for more meat with less rice. I'm 150lbs and 2 big macs would be good enough for me so you can imagine how little meat was there. finally no napkin at all. 2 stars for the taste but that's it, sorry.",
   "Ordered from doordash, hardly any meat in the curry and the taste was so sweet it was not able to eat to food. This place has gone down hill very fast. Would not recommend them.",
   "If I could rate zero stars I would purely on the service here. They are extremely rude and talk bad about their customers. My husband caught them talking about him in their language which is unacceptable whenever we are paying them for a service. They should be happy that people pay for their non authentic garbage! There are other Indian restaurants in Indy that better deserve the attention this place gets. Overall, this restaurant is not worth the money, time, nor the poor experience",
   "The menu and service were beyond our expectations. I surely enjoyed the ambience of this spot. First-rate restaurant to take the family out for lunch.",
   "Bad food, rude owners and no free parking. I ordered Navratan Korma and got boiled vegetables with little bit of herbs added to it. Very disgusting and cheap. We also heard the owners trash talk about their customers when we were waiting for our order to take out. There are much better restaurants around. Do yourself some favor and avoid this place. I won\u2019t be returning back here for sure."

   "We chose Tony's for a special birthday treat and we were not let down at all. I've traveled the US and ate at so many steakhouses, but I am simply at a loss for words at how AMAZING the food was. I had an inch thick Ney York Strip that was PERFECT all the way through. Me fiance had the bone in ribeye that was beyond compare! Highly recommend the truffle wedges as a side(which feed 2-4 people). They were crispy, fluffy potato wedges of heaven.  The staff was always ready to help and make sure everything was perfect. Also a special occasion was that the owner, Tony, was there! He personally spoke with every guest and interacted one on one with his staff to make sure there was a flawless execution and presentation.  There were 2 other managers who were also monitoring the atmosphere of the restaurant, the amazing live music, and the customer experience as well. both Tony and the two managers took time to know our names and speak with us momentarily while we ate, and also took time to learn our birthdays and wish my fiance a happy birthday.  Never had such an amazing experience at any restaurant of any kind let alone a steakhouse. Would recommend this to any friends, family or stranger.  Worth every penny!! We will definitely be life long patrons!",
   "This restaurant was recommended to me by a business man who frequents Indianapolis.  It was the best recommendation I have ever received.  Fantastic food.  Fantastic service.  Fantastic decor.   The prices are appropriate for the quality of the restaurant.",
   "After my third time dining at Tony\u2019s I thought I would leave a review. Every time there has been absolutely amazing. Steaks are great and the sweet potatoes are to die for. They truly treat you as family there, and I look forward to dining there again. BEST STEAKHOUSE IN INDIANAPOLIS",
   "This is a true dining experience. The crab cake is out of this world, the braised short ribs will melt in your mouth and the vanilla bean bread pudding is delicious! Our waiter was Peyton and he made the experience truly exceptional. The service is impeccable!!! We've never had this kind of dining experience. We'll be going back!",
   "The staff was amazing very informative. Then there was the food everything from the appetizers to main courses everything had a very savory taste with beautiful presentation! I highly recommend Tony's if your looking for a good mixture of steak and seafood with a very relaxing atmosphere."

Give them a try, you will be back again if you do.",

   "You might assume that since this place specializes in soups that their sandwiches must be an afterthought. Don't make that mistake. The soups are delicious, but the sandwiches really are the best in town. The Revelo has an amazing combo of creamy, melted cheese, tender pork, and some jalapenos to add a little heat.

We were celebrating our 5 year anniversary. We had personalized menus and a picture taken of us to celebrate the occasion!! The food was delicious!! Bacon wrapped scallops and a chopped salad. Bone in  ribeye streak that melted in our mouths! Rack of Lamb, sour cream mashed potatoes and asparagus. We had a complimentary dessert to compete our meal. Morton's hot chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream! The food was so fantastic, but the service was impeccable!! The wonderful people working there are what made the experience unforgettable. They left no stone unturned when it came to taking care of our needs. Our server was perfect! Already planning our next trip back!",

Rob was a very attentive and accomplished server. This restaurant has a cool old vibe in the basement. Oh, and my Lemom Drop martini was perfect!!",

   "I don't normally give 5 stars at any place no matter how good I think it is. But this place has absolutely exceeded my expectations with their food and service. The menu isn't pages long. (Thank goodness). In fact it's short, simple and very direct. The staff is super friendly and very much on point. Not ever have I encountered what many say is to be a \"hidden gem\", but definitely this place is genuinely just that! I'll be raving over this place for YEARS to come. The staff should expect me to become a regular customer on the weekends. Words can not describe the positive vibes I'm feeling after eating here.",
   "Very busy night for them! Made last minute reservations and got seated 1/2 hour late. No problem! Understandable! Great over busy staff.  Food was different and delightful.",
   "Definitely felt out of place however, the customer service was pleasant and they were very polite. The prices are what I would consider once in a blue moon kind of pricing. The atmosphere is very rustic with a classic vibe. Food was on point.",
   "The menu was great, the service was great and the chef delivered one of the courses herself. The food was outstanding. I recommend the shrimp and pork bao. #amazing\nDrinks were wonderfully unique.",
   "Still the best Sauzerac that I've had in Indy. The seasonal cocktail menu they have now is lots of fun. The food is also top notch."

   "Just from a burger perspective...not spectacular. It was cooked fine but neither the toppings nor the bun nor the meat were imho worth the higher price tag. Other food might be great and service was definitely awesome!! The cheese curd app was good - all the apps are definitely portioned for 4-5 people.",
   "Just went there for lunch.  Had a fantastic Cobb salad.  Their beer selection is incredible.  They have one of the largest lists of appetizers I have ever seen.  You can have dinner with the appetizers.  If you did you would miss their lobster and steak choices. I will return.",
   "Visited Yard House as a party of four people and reserved our spot through OpenTable. When we arrived we were immediately sat and the hostess staff was super friendly. The atmosphere is like any other Yard House you may visit and can always be a great time! Our food was prepared in a timely fashion and we all enjoyed our meals. We\u2019re glad we chose Yard House for our company dinner outing while in Indy and will visit again if we visit downtown Indy again.",
   "This was one of the few places open late night on a Saturday. I checked out the menu online and was impressed. When I arrived it was a condensed late night menu. I got the Nashville hot chicken. I was disappointed with the price ($16) for chicken and pancakes. I would have like another choice of side dish. But the chicken was good. \n\nThey have a late night happy hour food menu with less expensive options but nothing really looked filling. I also didn\u2019t think there were many healthy options aside from salad. \n\nIf you\u2019re looked for food late night it\u2019s really this or Steak and Shake. Or go during the day to experience the full menu.",
   "This place seems to always get it right. No matter how packed they are the service is always efficient and friendly. I love the beer selection, there is something for everyone. I would give it five stars if there were more menu items that I like. AND they do not have salsa on hand. Crazy! :)"

   "Had a great time celebrating our friends birthday here! Zoie our server was super nice and helped make sure our night was perfect! The cost was totally worth it with all the food we got and only $13 per person! We had a coupon from online for making a reservation that saved us lots of money. Also, you\u2019ll always order too much food! We knew ahead and ordered the perfect amount!",
   "My boyfriend and I went the day after Valentine\u2019s Day with reservations set. Right when we got checked in we felt as if the hosts and food runners were a tad rude. Our server was great along with the other servers around us. They did happen to accidentally take our entree to another table but they were honest and handled it well. The manager was a very nice guy! Overall, it was a nice first visit! We will definitely be back. The food was phenomenal!",
   "To preface, my wife and I go to Buca quite a bit.  Especially, the downtown Seattle and Las Vegas locations.  \n\nThe meal started out good and our server Christina was helpful and fun to talk to.   \n\nFor an appetizer, the mussels were really good. However, the chopped salad, which is usually great at other locations, was just plain horrible.  When we received it, it looked like it had been sitting in the servers window for a long time and was warm/soggy \n\nWhile waiting for our entree, I got up to use the restroom.  Some of the kitchen staff were in the public areas.  Very unusual.  No hellos or anything even though I said hello.   They gave me the feeling like I was holding them up from going home.   \n\nI got back to the table and we were served the spicy chicken rigatoni.  I know what this is supposed to look like folks, but it didn't look like anything close.  Totally dried out rigatoni, not saucy and there was hardly any chicken.   At this point, we just told our server to box it up and requested our check.  Even though we were still hungry, it was time to leave. \n\nFinally, we received the bill.  My wife was charged $60 for 3 wines that should have been $13 each.  I think they may have charged us for large pours, but we received short ones.  Again, we have been to other locations.\n\n$167 after tip and we had a $25 off coupon.  \nHorrible dining experience.  \n\nI know that this is after lots of great experiences at other locations, but it makes me feel like not going back to Buca period.",
   "Fabulous food. Vegetarian friendly. They even have a vegetarian menu! So rare. Interesting seasonal menu. Portions are quite large. I ordered a single entree and ended up taking part of it home with me. The service was perfect. I was attended to politely and in friendly and helpful manner. Ambience is interesting. I wasn't sure how to describe it. Check out the photos. But it felt warm and welcoming.",
   "Makes you feel like you walked into your Italian grandmother\u2019s house for dinner. Good food. Food is like dinner at home. Different plates serve different amounts of people. You can get lost in there but it is definitely a unique experience."

   "We had made reservations in person a week prior for a specific table at 5:00 and a specific waitress.  We had requested a large round table because we had a party of eight. When we arrived, they were not going to give us that table and when they did, we were informed that we had to be done by 7:00. \nWhen we were seated, it was not the waitress we had requested.  This waitress was OK until it was time for the bills.  Even though she confirmed who was with whom, when she returned with the bills 15 minutes later, they were wrong.  \nShe wrote out the orders again, by couple, and added all drinks and said she'd  be  right back.  During the 15 minutes it took her to return, a couple of restaurant staff walked by the table and looked at their watches.  \nWhen she returned we all gave our credit cards and one member of our group asked if they gave a military discount.  She said they did and asked for his ID and said she would adjust his bill. \nAfter another 15 minutes, and a few more looks from staff, a member of our group went to the front to let them know we had been waiting for over half an hour for our bills.  \nWhen the bills were finally brought back, the one who had asked for a military discount, was $5 MORE !   \nWe were pretty irritated by now, and just paid and left.  On the way out, we overheard a staff member say,  \"Yes, they finally left.\" We would have been gone a good half hour earlier if the waitress had gotten the bills correct.  \nWe have enjoyed eating here in the past, at least once a month, but this visit will cause us to rethink our choices.",
   "Had a great time at Charleston's. We arrived during the dinner rush time, and although the parking lot seemed full we were seated immediately. Our server, Tina, was great. She was friendly and took great care of us. The atmosphere and decor are somewhat upscale yet relaxed. Plenty of great options to choose. Our group had the Chicken tortilla soup, chicken enchiladas, and chicken picata. And for dessert we split a slice of key lime pie. Everything was great",
   "Awesome, absolutely divine if you want something mouth-watering served with great care and compassion this is the place to go... Every meal has been prepared with exquisite taste!!",
   "Nice dark woods and cozy booths, plus really good, well made Americana food.  This is my idea of perfect restaurant ambiance.",

Very attentive even though it was getting busier.  Ordered drinks and food and all was amazing!  Sides and whole chicken are large enough to share.  Great experience..we will be back!!",
   "That was a disappointment: I received a recommendation from a local guy that actually works in cuisine recommendation. We went the first day, an hour wait. The next day, 45 minute wait.... at this point the build up us great.\n\nThe third time we tried we had a seat at the bar. Nice bartender helped us select drinks (pretty common, nothing special), and I ordered the famous fried chicken with spicy honey.... Well, it was a friend chicken. That's it. The honey was just honey and some spice.\n\nI really don't get the hype about this place. I had better fried chicken in most diner and chains in other places",
   "First of all, THANK YOU to Maddie working at the front for genuinely taking the time to find my bracelet that I lost. You are a saint and deserve a raise for going the extra mile for customer care. Also, the food and atmosphere of The Eagle is awesome year round, and highlighted in the summer with the great patio seating.

   "Fantastic Italian restaurant. We got there right when it opened and it was immediately hoppin'. The service from the second we walked in to paying the bill 10/10 service. Now the food part. The food was wonderful as well. Both the fried mozerella and lasagna were very tasty and came out hot.",
   "Small, but cozy place. Great food and atmosphere, everytime. Marinara sauce with cheesy garlic bread is amazing. So is the tortellini!",
   "Let me start off by saying I\u2019m very disappointed by the food I had today. After my grandma and best friend hyped this place up to I was expecting a lot more quality. I came today to participate in Devour Indy and I wish I didn\u2019t. I ordered the chicken Marsala and the chicken Parmesan which I usually LOVE!! The sauce was too sweet and all of our chicken was tough. I came with 2 other people and they share my same opinion. The establishment was clean and the waitress was great!!! But my food was not a good representation of what I was told it would be!",
   "I made a reservation through this Google page for last night. Google said I had the reservation. When my date and I got to there, they said I didn't have one. I showed them on my phone the reservation I had, and they agreed that it said I did, but didn't offer anything to us. They said the wait would be at least an hour. The manager called today and only offered an insincere apology, and said they only use Yelp for reservations. It did seem like a nice place, but we were not able to experience it. I can't give anything but a 1 star review for this experience.",
   "The food was beyond delicious! Definitely one of the best places for Italian food. I recommend the stuffed ziti with their sauce. My mouth is honestly watering just writing this review! The place is extremely cozy and very family oriented. I can\u2019t wait to go back!"

I appreciate having the convenience of booking a table on open table. Cooper's is great when family or friends come in from out of town as the menu is great for anyone. Love the membership and the perks that follow it. Monthly tastings and bottles in addition to having discounts and rewards!",
   "Such an AMAZING carry out Easter meal! We ordered the ham and short ribs that came complete with Mary's potatoes with gravy, broccoli (perfectly cooked) the freshest and BIGGEST mixed salad, pretzel bread with butter, a WHOLE pie and a bottle of wine - for 200 -- there were five of us and we had enough leftover for full meal for all five us.  The food was wonderfully prepared -- and packaged -- so neatly with ALL serving utensils.  All the heated goods were in containers that easily went from low-temp oven where we kept warm for an hour - to our counter for self-serving.  I was SO impressed and happy with everything.  I would recommend this option whether the restaurant was closed or not!  Although the service at CH is impeccable and I do miss wine tastings. Look forward to being back.  THANK YOU INDIANAPOLIS CREW for putting together a beautiful meal for our family this Easter.",
   "We came here on a Friday night and were seated promptly. Our server was good too, albeit slightly busy. However, we did not enjoy the food. Almost everything was over-seasoned. The soy ginger salmon was too sweet and the short rib risotto was too salty. The fries came lukewarm and were also too salty. My favorite dish of the night was probably the pretzel bread served at the start of the meal. Nice touch to have free wine tasting, though. Hopefully the food quality improves.",
   "Simply the best! Been coming here for four years but Christopher made tonight an extra special experience.  Always on point with the wine (of course), the service, and the food!!

I forget her name but she\u2019s been with the restaurant for 7 years and really knew her stuff!

   "Amazing restaurant with probably some of the best Ethiopian food I have ever had. The ambiance is okay (not my taste), the location is not great, but the food and coffee are excellent. Great place to order large platter with friends or family and try out a variety of dishes. Unlimited Injera (bread), and they will bring out delicious spicy sauces if you ask for it. Courteous and fast servers. My favorite place for Ethiopian food in Indy, and even though it is very far away from my house, I can't stop driving here to get food!",
   "Simply amazing. Had the vegetarian combo plate for four, and every single dish on the plate was killer. The coffee ceremony is a must. The staff were super nice and helpful. The decor is beautiful and the ambiance is very fitting, with Ethiopian & Eritrean music playing over the speakers and frankincense thick in the air. Definitely some of the best Ethiopian food I've ever had.",
   "Good Ethiopian food and prices are reasonable. I got the Beef Sampler.  It was very good. The food had a bit of spicy heat to it but not too much. Very flavorful.",
   "Excellent service. The Major combination plate offers a wonderful variety of flavors.  Will definitely return.",
   "I love this place. When I lived in Indianapolis I ate there a few times every month. Best Ethiopian food I have ever had. And the wait staff takes the time to explain to you what everything is and how it works."

Went here based on a recommendation from our layover hotel, who also gave a coupon for a free dessert with dinner. Had the Prime Rib Manhattan, Medium Rare. Probably one of the BEST steaks I've ever had. Good marbling, thick, not overcooked, well seasoned. The green beans were nice and soft, not rubbery like some places. Sweet tea was the right amount of sweet without being too overbearing.  Had Lemon Tarts for the dessert. The raspberry drizzle was an excellent contrast. Did not expect to be wowed by food in Indy, but was definitely a nice surprise.",
   "Not far from work and I enjoy trying restaurants other than chains. \nThis place has the best club sandwich in town! Simply awesome! So good I visit several times a month. It\u2019s worth the effort, it you sit at the bar say hi. Enjoy",
   "The decor is a bit off and interesting but the food is definitely good.  The prime rib Manhattan was tasty and the stuffed salmon was light and refreshing.  Be forewarned to get there early because they do sell out of the prime rib.  I would like to come back again during warmer weather and sit out on the patio area they have.",
   "Like the sign says \"Best Prime Rib in Indianapolis.\" (It is herb encrusted and takes 18 hours to prepare.)  They also have great cheesecake. There is no dress code here so business or casual is acceptable. (They have event rooms for proms and other events.)",
   "Ordered food to go from here, that\u2019s what we got for stuffed shrimp (only 6) a thumbnail potato and some ugly cabbage after waiting for 40 mins, charged us $30 and when I wanted to complain, the boy was so rude and start yelling at us. Definitely sure that this place not worth of your time and money to spend."

   "The best Italian food I've had since Arthur Street in Brooklyn.  We all shared a little of our dinners so was able to taste many items.  My dish was Sausage and broccolini, a common dish in restaurants on the east coast but you don't see it much in the mid-west.  The kale salad was the most unique.  Every dish was very good.  Very comfortable atmosphere, very friendly and knowledgeable service staff.",
   "I've been wanting to try this place since I've seen it pop up on Instagram, finally had the chance to set up a dinner for my 30th bday. Located in the old smoke house in fountain square it's been redone into a classic/trendy lounge style Italian place.\nOur service was awesome! I love when recommendations are made and dishes are explained.\nI have to say you must get the aperol spritz, it's the house cocktail and it's awesome, light and refreshing and the largest cocktail they offer.\nI'm not typically an appetizer person but we decided to get the bruschetta, but it was a non traditional style with hot honey and ricotta and it was amazing, im going to try and make the dish myself.\nFor the main course I had the vongole, a delicious pasta dish with garlic tomatoes and clams. I also had a delicious white wine blend, and to top the whole night off I had a tiramisu on the house as a birthday treat. Awesome experience I can't wait to go back!",
   "Reminded me of the neighborhood Italian restaurants from the 90's, but in a contemporary space.  Growing up with those meant the menu was full of comfort foods.  Service was very attentive.  Nothing stood out.  All in all a solid choice, but not something to go out of your way for."

   "We can\u2019t say enough great things about Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Boatyard. \nWe decided to have our wedding reception here because of the view onto Eagle Creek, the beautiful grounds, and the pricing for the venue. I had never eaten at the restaurant but my husband assured me that the food is fantastic. When we first contacted them, the events manager, Savannah, was quick to respond with the menu and all the options we would have for our special day. She was super patient and so understanding with all of our questions. Wedding planning can be stressful but Savannah\u2019s cheerfulness just made us feel more comfortable. She\u2019s really a pleasure to work with. There are many different packages for food and drinks that you will find what you\u2019re looking for within in your budget. For our tasting, Savannah and Nathalie made sure we had a perfect experience and even equipped us with a sheet to jot our opinions about each plate- these little details really made a difference for us. We decided to do our own decorations for this event and the staff was very accommodating in creating our vision. Savannah even coordinated with our vendors to make sure everything would arrive on time. On the day of, we received so many compliments about the entire staff. The bartender remembered my name and made sure I never went without a drink. Once the outbreak is over and we can have gatherings again, please consider Rick\u2019s for any event you\u2019re looking to host.",
   "A superb restaurant! This place was recommended because of their great food and its proximity to Eagle Creek airport. (KEYE) We flew in to Eagle Creek and took a 3 minute walk across the street to Rick's. It was Valentine's Day, so they were packed. We had a table next to the big windows with a great view over the water. The seafood was fresh and the wine was good. If you're a pilot, this is a dining fly in must.",
   "I am sorry, but I forgot to take some pictures of the food! It was just so good I had to eat it all quickly! My wife liked the food, my brother liked the food. The atmosphere is nice, the waiters are great. I will come back again with more people and pictures.",
   "My family has enjoyed many years at Rick's. Today, though the service was a bit challenging, we were patient as we knew Rick's holds a standard for their service. I suppose every restaurant has its day because, as we all know well people are unpredictable and you know what a person is dealing it. We are very understanding group. But the minor issues were immediately corrected by the manager, Nick. Thank you Nick,l for upholding the standard in your restraunt. The food is always presented well, and the bottomless mimosas are a nice addition to Brunch. Definitely try the stuffed french toast. It's a signature dish even if the menu doesn't say it! I recommend Rick's for drinks, meals, and ambiance. Will always be one of my favorite places in Indy! \u2764",
   "Amazing place to go out with your girl. I had a great experience there. You can even go for lake side walk. And in summers you can sit at outside bar."

   "Had a great time here! Awesome food and good service! Had a large group and we were in a rush!! The server made sure we got our food in time and that we felt super accommodated! Made it to our meeting on time with room for ice cream! Cool atmosphere and decor, too!",
   "This is a fantastic place. We've been coming here since the 80s. The atmosphere is awesome. The food is great and always served hot. We always go on Sundays for the waiter Juan only works on Sundays. He is an excellent waiter. He has waited on us for years.\nThe kitchen manager is fantastic. Josh keeps everything going.",
   "I'm from Louisville, Ky and we have this restaurant here but even with one in my backyard, I've never eaten here. While in the area we decided to eat here and I was blown away. The waitress, Ashley, was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the lasagna and was really wonderful. The decor is really nice and feels like you're stepping back in time. Highly recommend this establishment.",
   "Awesome spot for friends and family alike. Great atmosphere. Really good food. 5/5 on the food. All entrees are 3 course meals. Soup/salad, entree, ice cream. (Skip the vanilla and go for the local favorite, it's amazing!)\nOh, and there's a train car in the building that you can eat your dinner in... Awesome time tonight at the Old Spaghetti Factory!!",
   "This will be one of my favorites. It was my first time back in a while. The service was good and the food was off the chain."

   "Apart from spicy feta which was average all the meal was under average. I specifically asked if they were using fresh fish for grouper and our waiter said yes. When I received the meal and told her this wasn't fresh fish, she started with a whole different story. \nTheir daily specials that had seafood kebab, the waiter said that it is a mistake, on the menu it was written Taramosalada that this is one of the most popular appetizer on Greek table, she said they do not have it any more.\nThe octopus that i took was very hard to chew.\nI don't think that i will be back. \nSorry.",
   "Awesome local Greek restaurant! Very diverse menu that can accommodate a wide variety of palates and diets. Enjoyed the vegetarian moussaka with rice and green beans - very delicious and a perfectly sized portion. Atmosphere is great too; well decorated and not too crammed with seating so you have space between tables. Wait staff is friendly and attentive.",
   "As always, delicious food!  A relaxing ambience and very pleasant wait staff.  I always highly recommend Athens on 86th for a fine ding experience.",
   "Authentic and delicious! Stopped in for lunch had the Greek spaghetti and my oh my oh my what a pleasant surprise! Delicious! The bread they brought to the table was warm and buttery goodness I wish I could have it sent home back in Michigan.",
   "We were seated quickly, and our drink order was taken.  Drinks arrived quickly and our food order was taken.  The salads and bread arrived quickly, and were both delicious.  Our entrees arrived at the proper time; after we finished the salad and before we started wondering where the food was.\nThe food.... wow!  I ordered the Taste of Greece, as I like to sample a variety of items at a restaurant I'm visiting for the first time.  Every single item was amazing.  I'm very impressed."

   "I would eat here every day for the rest of my life if I could. I'd weigh 300 and I'd be broke, but I would be happy. The food is exceptional. I particularly like the smoked meat loaf wrapped in pepper bacon. The rib tips are excellent, as is the country fried steak, as well as the smoked brisket, fried catfish, chicken and waffles, and many more delicious menu items. \n\nToday I had a boneless fried chicken breast smothered in an onion gravy that was sensational. The sides are over the top: my favorites are the creamy mac and cheese and the flavorful cholard greens, but try the bourbon creamed corn, too. \n\nI like the laid back family atmosphere -- many families with little ones, and no one in a hurry to leave. And I especially like that the owner, Chef James, comes around and greets his guests at their tables as time permits.\n\nBy the way, the Banana Pudding is out of this world good -- so smooth and creamy and full of banana slices and vanilla wafers. If you like great soul food, you will absolutely love His Place Eatery!",
   "This place is a foodies dream , I had rib tips with collard greens, and macaroni cheese. The tips were very tender on the sweet side with the spices . The greens , and the macaroni and cheese were wonderful tasting . I ordered a cat fish sandwich to go oh my lord some of the best cat fish I ever had . Wow I\u2019m impressed with the great taste . The staff was super friendly fast service, very clean restaurant. The menu is nice size something for everyone here.",
   "Absolutely delicious!! The restaurant was packed when we arrived and it was worth the wait. The pulled pork is some of the best I've ever had and the creamed corn was perfect! Can't wait to go back and try the chicken and dumplings which they were sold out of when we went.",
   "This is my favorite restaurant in Indianapolis area. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a home cooked meal or even a catered holiday family meal. The staff is great and the owner is always awesome. He really cares about his customers and even comes out to greet them at the table. He helps wait and clean tables when things are busy and that\u2019s always a great quality to see in upper management . I hope they expand and bring this delicious food to south bend !!!!!",
   "First time at this restaurant ordered food to go. All good signs when you see customers coming in frequently and the delicious aroma in the restaurant.\n\nThe ribs, fried chicken collard greens,mac and cheese  and the peach cobbler were so tasty and delicious. They really know soul food i felt so good after i savored each bite.\n\nBest soul food i had in a long time. Will definitely be back again when im in Indiana.\n\nOnly thing is they need a bigger restaurant to accommodate more people."

I didn't like the seitan high fives as much, but it wasn't bad and the sauce for it was fantastic :) I also really enjoyed the atmosphere of the city market with all the different food vendors, the big open space and open seating with lots of light, and when I went for lunch, there was a chorus performing for the holidays.",
   "A great place to explore the world of vegan/vegetarian dishes. Because it is in the City Market, you can sample the food without committing to anything actual restaurant. The flavors were incredible!",
   "An Indianapolis classic. Excellent food and service, wide array of (comfort food with international influence) dishes and the menu evolves often enough to keep it interesting. Best biscuits and gravy in the city. They're a seitan supplier for other restaurants around Indy and it shows. If you make only one vegan stop in town this is it.",
   "I loved it! Dessert, breakfast, lunch, they have it all! At the cashier was so sweet! The stuff available was decently affordable. I missed it the first time I came here but I'm glad I found it and finally tried them out! Their vegan food is great! I'll be coming back every time I come to Indy! Even my 4yr old loved it here, and we became friends with the cashier too."

Amidst the list of intriguing cocktails I chose the \"apple pie\" cocktail as my dessert and was richly rewarded.Repeal also has an eclectic, t historic atmosphere.

The bartenders are knowledgeable and know how to make a great drink. Highly recommend the Selfish Hawaiian Nachos! Highly recommend this place! We will be back!",
   "Now for the food. By the time I got my food, the cheese and oil in the Alfredo sauce had started to separate. There wasn't a ton of sauce and the sauce didn't have much of any flavor. It did seem like the cheese was fresh but it would have been nice to have some garlic and salt in the sauce at least. The bread and salad were good."

   "This was another attempt of mine to find as close to authentic wiener schnitzel as I could. I was trying to satisfy a childhood memory of living in Austria and eating schnitzel. I was able to look past it being pork, rather than authentic veal. The first 5 bites were incredible. The closest to authentic I've found yet, but as I continued eating it, I started to get a sweet taste. I realized the cabbage had so much juice in it that it covered the bottom of the plate, tainting the flavor of the schnitzel. This is not what one would expect for a $20+ plate of food. I was just passing through town, and if I lived closer I would consider trying it again. I gave 4 stars still because a different kitchen crew might plate the food a little better.\n\nRegardless of my schnitzel experience, the food was cooked very good. The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. Prices were a little high, but they weren't out of line considering the area, the atmosphere, and the name of the restaurant itself.",
   "Stopped here for lunch while in the area. This place has your typical pub menu with good prices. We like the food but didn't love it. The tenderloin was absolutely huge. Way to big for a lunch meal. It said tenderloin sandwich but there is no way to eat it like a sandwich. The service was fast and friendly!",
   "They make a good tenderloin, maybe pounded a little to flat for my taste. The kettle chips are pretty good. The cost is a little much for what you get. Parking is the big issue with all the construction and they have a small lot. They have a nice patio out front to eat and a big selection of beers and alcohol.",
   "Today i had lunch with my friend/realtor in the friendly & tasty confines of the aristocrat pub. Kathryn as always proved why she is a # 1 person & server. I have known her since 2005. Alans fish n chips meal must have been good! He was a member of the clean plate club. That made 2 of us. Great atmosphere, excellent food, super staff! Need i say more...",
   "We've been going there since they opened in 1985 so they must be doing something right! Just good ole pub food, among other dinner options. Just like the feel of being there. Usually eat on the bar side door that true pub feel. Very nice servers and hosts."

Worth it for special occasions and I believe they have like $10 tacos so you don\u2019t have to spend a fortune.",
   "Black Market has been reinvigorated by new chef Esteban Rosas, who has transformed the food menu into somthing quite special. The new spring menu is full of bright colors and flavors, the roasted trout is a must try. The Octopus is super tender and perfectly cooked.

I swear the first time I was here the menu was more Mediterranean but the website describes the restaurant as Modern Mexican.  Either way the food was delicious and I would recommend this place to anyone."

Going inside of the place felt like a step in time, imagining what a lovely dinner in the 1800\u2019s would be like. Or close. Inside of this old, fancy former farm house was one of the best meals my buddy and I have had. Very charming on the inside. EXCELLENT food. Great waiter. Dinner was an experience. We ate like Kings of the Prairie. Highly recommended.",
   "First time coming here and won't be the last. The restaurant is very nice on the inside. The dinner is served family style. They are best known for their chicken. The meals come with a ton of different sides, bread, salad, main entree, and ice cream for dessert. There is no way of leaving here hungry. By far the best part is the excellent service. We had our 20 month old daughter with us and the staff so good with her. It made for a very enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this place.",
   "The food here is always delicious!  But watch your portions because the food is very rich.  You can get a small glass of tomato juice or creamy onion soup for starters.  (The creamy onion soup is not French onion soup, this is much better)!\nThen if you've ordered ahead for your party, most people get their fabulous fried chicken.  You also get a wedge of lettuce with a delightful vinaigrette, mashed potatoes (lots of butter in it, so yummy, but really rich too), pickled beets, apple butter for the bread, green beans and at the end you get ice cream along with a silver serving set with bowls of syrups to pick from.  Oh, and at the end of the meal they bring everyone these steaming Jasmine-scented damp terrycloth towels to wipe your hands off well.  But it smells so good I can guarantee someone in your group will bury their nose in it for the heavenly scent.  The decor is absolutely beautiful, just be warned the restrooms are upstairs.  The servers are truly the best to make your event a wonderful memory.",
   "Ben going there for over 50 years. Always pleased with food and service. Excellent for the whole family including the younger ones and the older ones. A previous review warned the bathrooms were upstairs. They also have downstairs bathrooms so do not let that be a deterrent. You will be please you went",
   "Fantastic place! One of my favorites. I have been going here since I was a kid. Same great tasting food as always. I wonder what happened to the little gift shop?"

   "Food is always amazing. Steaks cooked to perfection. Great service. My husband and I went on Valentine's Day evening. We knew it would be busy and we would have to wait a little while. We walked in just before it started to get even busier. We waited about 35-40 minutes. Not too bad considering how busy they were. I really thought it was cool that the host held a little boy for the majority of the time that the parents waited  to be seated. You don't see that very often. \nWe had a good-sized table when we were finally seated, unlike some restaurants that have tiny tables for parties of two. \n\nMy husband and I both got cups of loaded baked potato soup, Flo's 8 oz Filet medium-term. Yum. Our waitress Jody was great. We never ran out of drinks, and we was very busy, so that impressed us that she kept up. \n\nThe only reason I gave 4/5 was because I feel they need a larger waiting area. They only have a few small benches, otherwise when they get very busy like tonight, guests are overflowing into the bar area and crowded at the entry. Overall, it was a great experience, though. Great job! We will definitely return! :)",

When I went to call back the line was busy I waited 15 minutes go back again the line was busy I love this restaurant but this was extremely disappointing experience.",
   "AMAZING Tacos. Stopped for lunch and had drinks and tacos. So Delish! We sat in the basement (21 or over). We will definitely go back!",
   "Good food and drinks. Would recommend trying the pineapple margarita. The tacos were flavorful but the portions were much smaller than expected. House made salsa is fresh and delicious and the loaded queso is a good accompaniment to fill you up when the tacos leave you wanting more.",
   "Good tacos and friendly staff! Tacos seemed a little pricey for their size, but they were good. Would highly recommend trying!",
   "Love this spot to split chips/queso and a pitcher of margaritas.  The patio in the back is a fun spot and also has another bar back there.  It also connects with their other restaurant through the patio called \"Krueger's\" which is also very good."

The live music is always on point and the food is great (although a bit pricey). I had an order of pastrami poutine that hit the spot - it was very salty towards the end though. Definitely one of the top places to dine at if you're looking for an upscale casual vibe.",

Enjoyed the shrimp and grits but my dining partner had a room temperature lamb shank. It tasted delicious but needed to be hot coming out of the kitchen.  Will be back."

   "1/25/2020 8:55am\n\nThis place is located in a strip mall with a pot \nholed parking lot. The front decor is inviting. \n\nWalking in the hostess greeted us and sat us in a booth. Decor is water themed, fire hydrants, hoses, and piping. The place is clean. \n\nWaitress greeted us, she was pleasant. \n\nChecked out the buffet (10.99$) but decided to order off the menu. More for your money. \n\nUpdate 12:48p - you will get explosive poo if you eat The biscuit and gravy; the gravy was greasy, the biscuits were good. Temperature was lukewarm. \n\nFrench toast full order came out cold, with cold syrup but it was good. Soft and fluffy. \n\nHash browns are amazing! A must have. \n\nThey are stingy with their napkins... if your sever comes back allowing you to ask - you better ask before or while you\u2019re ordering.\n\nThis is a good place for comfort food! Check them out...",
   "I was here in the morning 1.5 years ago over the weekend and ordered breakfast off the menu rather than the buffet.  I remember good service, large portions, fresh tasting food.  This time I went with family and had the buffet.  The hot food was mediocre.  It was about what you'd find in a nicer free hotel breakfast with sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, pancakes, french toast sticks, hash browns, sausage and biscuits.   Toppings were strawberry sauce, syrup, honey butter, cheese sauce.  They had a small selection of fresh fruit and cottage cheese.  Missing were toast, bagels, salsa, cream cheese, dispensers  with coffee, juice, grits, oatmeal, cold cereal,  granola, yogurt, nuts, raisins, cheese, cold salami, milk, muffins, donuts, tea (some of these could be bought separate and delivered by waitress if you wanted it).  So in some ways a free hotel breakfast buffet is better than this one.  And the hot food didn't seem that fresh even though we got there 30 min after opening at 8:30am.  Good, place, just not the buffet unless you're not expecting much variety.   The decor is nice.",
   "We had breakfast here not too long ago. The coffee was very very good. Some of the best I've ever had. The biscuits and gravy was great. I ordered , The Emily.. I'm not sure why they named it that. It came with 3 eggs cooked to my preference,and a choice of ham, sausage or bacon. I chose bacon. The bacon was well cooked. They should've named it the Fat Alberta. Pan cakes looked great too. Their skillet meals were also very appealing. Clean restrooms. Nice decor,friendly staff quick service too.  So, if you're the owner, pls treat my grandmother and my aunt to a free meal, since they come in every morning. That would be cool. Oh and by the way, they have a rewards program.. eat 30 meals. Get 1 free. Great 1st impression for me.  Kudos to Dales!!!",
   "I had never even heard of this place. Took a chance and wonderfully surprised! The yeast rolls ate amazing and they have the best green beans ever. Loved the pork chop special. Will definitely be going back!",
   "Steak was ordered well done came medium well had to finish cooking it so it could be eaten ordered a baked potato they sent mashed potatoes. The chicken and dumplings had burnt dumplings and very little chicken. Was not worth the price."

   "The service here was great and so was the food! I ordered the house salad which was huge and 2 different dressings since I couldn't decide. They make all their dressings in house!!! I'm really particular about pizza crust and this was just right! It was not too soft and not too hard. Cozy and relaxed atmosphere. I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area!",
   "One of the best pizza places I've been to. Got the Mediterranean 16\" and large house salad and it was enough for 2 people plus leftover pizza. Cool bar and I like the cozy atmosphere. Service was a bit slow and not too friendly. Salad came out fast and pizza was came out in reasonable time. Good value.",
   "Wow. This a perfect place for hanging with friends and family. The environment is relaxed. The workers are focused on great customer service. I ordered the salad, gluten free pepperoni pizza and Mr. Pibb. I enjoyed watching the pizza making theater happening in the window. The guys preparing the pizzas were having so much fun making the pizzas. I could tell they enjoy what they do as well as each other. Its probably why my pizza tasted so good. There was soft crisp texture to the crust and the sauce was sweet tomato with a hint of peppers. I also love the sliced tomatoes in my salad.  They too were sweet. Also the price was amazing. I was really surprised who cheap my meal was. Wish I could get them 6 or 7 stars!",
   "Place was pretty cozy. You can eat inside or out. First time there and won't be last. Pizza was very good. Staff made Bazbeaux feel you welcomed",
   "I mostly get here for lunch where you walk up and buy by the slice. Each day they sell four different pizzas by the slice. You can also order from the menu if you wish."

   "Honestly one of the best steakhouses in the city. Service is always excellent and the food is even better. Can never go wrong with a smoked old fashioned and a tomahawk steak.",
   "Came here for the Wagyu Steak, and it is absolutely worth it! I thought it was fun how they had a certificate of authenticity for my steak and how they showed us the steak before it was cooked. Absolutely beautiful inside and the chairs for the tables are really comfortable. We had carrot cake for dessert and frankly we needed more people because the slice was giant! Photos don't do it justice. Make sure you get some coffee with your dessert because it is amazing. The staff is phenomenal and they were extremely helpful with all of our questions!",
   "To start I wish I had more pictures of the other food I had as well, but it was just so good I completely forgot. This was the second time I\u2019ve had wagyu beef and I must say, it never disappoints. For anyone that has never tried it before I highly recommend it.",
   "Went for my boyfriend and I's second anniversary, and our minds were BLOWN! Fabulous food, staff, and ambience! One of the best culinary experiences I've had for sure. We will be back!",
   "The magnificent atmosphere, the cheerful wait staff, and the memorable food were all beyond spectacular! The buttery filet mignon and the succulent lobster tail that melted in your mouth were some of the best I've ever had! We went for our 5 year anniversary and we received a wonderful note from the staff giving us their best wishes as well as a smores dessert that was warm and ooey gooey! May not be a normal date night trip but definitely worth the special occasion trip!"

   "We love going to Hedge Row for Sunday brunch. Their bottomless mimosas are a great deal. The farmers breakfast or the burger are usually my go to order. The staff is always friendly and attentive. Patio is awesome when the weather is nice. Typically we do not have a long wait time for a table which is rare on Mass Ave.",
   "Loved it.\nGreat menu of starters and sides. Actually had an entire meal from that, without trying the main courses. The Brussels sprouts are amazing, and so is the pork skewers.\n\nWill definitely return when back in town",
   "The dishes were flavorful. Good size portion, but definitely not \"a lot\" on any plate. Spicy stuff was actually spicy and not mainstream spicy. Cocktails were pretty good, we had a couple of the signature cocktails and were not disappointed. Service was not the most cheerful but was speedy so I wouldn't complain but others might. Environment is clean, modern yet pretty warm. Overall, definitely a nice location for adult meals. I would not recommend for kids. I don't know if they had a kids menu but the main menu is not very kid friendly items.",
   "Hedge Row is a lively bistro. Food was well prepared and delicious. Vibe is very relaxing, warm, and inviting. While enjoyable and unique, the cocktails could be a greater volume for the price. Service could use a polish\u2014uncomfortably long waits between waitstaff stops and had to flag once or twice. Otherwise great!",
   "This is a nice establishment with a unique restaurant lay out and open kitchen concept.  We enjoyed our food, which you could tell was all made with fresh ingredients.  \n\nWe ordered the hush puppies, which I typically don\u2019t enjoy, but these were phenomenal especially with the syrup on top.  The kale chicken salad was prepared well with tons of great ingredients making it tasty.  Lastly, the chicken sandwich was the least favorite of ours, but it was still good just not great.  However, the fries save this dish because those things are some of the best fries I\u2019ve ever encountered.  \n\nEveryone at the restaurant was friendly and genuine it seemed, besides our server.  She just seem disengaged and in auto pilot.  Honestly that\u2019s the only reason I gave a 4/5.  I\u2019ll still definitely go back because everyone has an off day and the food was incredible!"
