  "Gourmet Italian food at reasonable prices. The service was exemplary. The sunset view over the Hudson was spectacular. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Take some time to walk around the waterfront. This is NYC at its best!",
  "Fast service. Nice staff. Food came quick. 10/10!",
  "Food was incredibly good. Appetizers, Main Course, and Dessert. I've been all over Italy and preferred this place to anything that I've had there. Servings are not huge, but the quality of the food was the reason for that. Was very full after, not sure how to explain that, but I wasn't hungry at all even 8 hours later. Servers were very friendly. No wait at all to get in or to be served. Very generous with the appetizers.",
  "This spot is my preferred one. I go to many restaurants but to this one I go the most. The crew is very welcoming and the food they cook is so fresh and tasty. I am always happy to have a decent dinner in this place. I highly recommend this place.",
  "Fantastic place to have an Italian lunch/dinner overlooking the Hudson River, even with views to the Statue of Liberty. A must to if you're around the Financial Distric area."

Otherwise, you have a beautiful view on it from park. There are many outdoor shows in the park. As well as some monuments honoring soldiers and explorers.",
  "Underrated and amazing spot in New York City. I've been to New York a million times as my family is from Brooklyn but I've never been to this park. It's beautiful, spacious, and kept clean. Nearby are pieces of the Berlin Wall, the raging bull statute, a viewpoint for the Statue of Liberty, and several beautifully made memorials for the Armed Forces. I highly recommend walking about this entire area but definitely make sure to wander through Battery Park. Castle Clinton, the immigrants statue, and several other sites are a must see.",
  "I feel like this area should be updated.  As a tourist, it felt very run down and could use some love.  If it is the official place to view the statue, it didn't feel like it.  The monuments were impressive.",
  "Beautiful park at the bottom tip of the island.. it's filled with tourists gawking at statue of liberty during the day and it's quietly peaceful and beautiful at night with all the vintage-style street lights overlooking the brightly lit statue of liberty. Definitely worth a visit for tourists and local alike.",
  "I love this place.It's so beautiful if you see it at sunset. Battery Park is one of the most unforgettable places that I've been in NYC. I will definitely come back when I have a chance to go NYC again. It's a must go!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude2d\u2764"

  "A beautiful park, albeit a little bit small. Definitely a nice place to sit for a while and collect your thoughts. Very close to the Holocaust remembrance museum, and a great place to reflect on what you learned there. Walking distance from the Staten Island ferry, this is certainly worth a little detour.",
  "I had a walk along there, and I also did the ferry wheels cruise, it was so fun. Hell of a good time for me, I saw the statue of bridge, Brooklyn bridge and many more. Helicopter tour if anyone is interested. Plenty of people in the cruise, and a man there to tell you guys about the history of the city. Great time",
  "Please don\u2019t miss visiting this park. The view of the harbor is amazing. If you like the outdoors, I highly recommend this place to you. Sit down and just relax.",
  "This place is my old stomping ground! The boat traffic and sunsets are amazing and breath-taking! If you are looking for a peaceful, tranquil, restful spot, this is your spot!  You can even see the  spectacular fireworks on holidays from this location! The park staff always pleasant and helpful! Clean bathrooms!",

The memorial is solemn and spiritual in its simplicity. A beautiful site, surrounded by the sea, the skyscrapers and trees of Battery Park. Especially beautiful at sunset.",

We all loved our drinks and a nice cocktail menu besides the classics. \nWe all got free Irish coffees before we left, they were beautiful. \nHighly recommend.",
  "Went there on a Friday night and definitely a popular spot in the area! Pretty busy and cramped downstairs just like any pub at happy hour but once you get upstairs, it is an entire other story. Would absolutely recommend getting a table to really experience the Dead Rabbit. Fantastic service! Just going through the menu was an experience in itself with its graphic novel theme and the server was very knowledgeable and helpful whenever we had questions about their unique drinks. After we received our drinks and food, the waitress realized they needed our table and moved us to another which was no problem at all but then after it made our visit truly memorable. We were put, in my opinion, a better table and the service was very apologetic(even though it was no inconvenience to us). They gave us a round of their amazing Irish Coffees and some delicious bread pudding! Can not over state the service that we received and made me feel like I was back in Ireland. Can't wait to go again and try some more of their unique drink concoctions! Thank you for an awesome night Dead Rabbit!",
  "A two story restaurant and bar. The first floor is an Irish bar with a large menu and plenty of drink options. It's the upstairs cocktail bar that makes this place for me. A changing menu of amazing cocktails. The staff are very helpful at finding the right drink for you. Definitely have the Irish coffee before you go",
  "Fantastic Experience! Came into Town to Visit my sister with my parents and took them to the Parlour on the 2nd Floor. The level of service was impeccable, the food was amazing and the Cocktails were unreal. Lived up to the Hype. Highly Recommend! \n\nP.S.- For the food, I highly recommend the lamb chop pops. I could have eaten 8 of those in one sitting.",
  "Such a cool place! Wanted to come for a long time and glad I finally made it. Came pretty early on a Saturday in November, maybe 5 pm, and it was already decently full. In the downstairs part it kind of reminds me of a fancier cocktail version of McSorley's with the old school decor and sawdust on the floor, but it's still really chill and not stuffy. There are two sides of the bar although there's more seating on the far side. We (3 of us) put our name down for a table and we luckily got one after 10-15 only which was nice because it was crowded enough to be uncomfortable standing if you didn't have a spot at the bar. Cocktails are inventive and fun and we didn't get food but it looked good.\n\nWe then went upstairs after putting our name down and not waiting that long. Upstairs has such a different vibe, and this was the dead rabbit I was expecting. It's darker, quiet, and there are tables / seats for everyone with no loiterers or unnecessary crowds. This is where the menu looks like a graphic novel / dark comic book and I just absolutely loved it!! I couldn't read the whole thing at the time, but it also appeared to be part of a series so I didn't have the background, but I loved it all the same. Pages and pages of different cocktails went with the story (I think?) and were arranged from lightest to booziest. They were excellent and I loved everything about it. They also give you a little starter drink served in a tiny teacup, love!\n\nThen we went back downstairs after and met a few more people, and they got in no problem. Such a cool spot with two different vibes depending on what you're looking for, both awesome! Will be back if I'm in this neighborhood!"

Would like to recommend all who are visiting Battery Park or nearby areas.",

The service is excellent; from the moment you walk in, you get a friendly welcome, all questions answered about the menu and my server brought over some extra surprises with the meal. He presented my beer bottle as if it were a bottle of fine wine. The food is fresh and delicious; great portions and servings. Would definitely recommend to anyone in search of good Indian cuisine.",

There is a good selection of quality beers, a well stocked bar, and friendly barmaids that are happy to help you pick something from the many choices on the menu and put together a sandwich or other order that is made with exactly what you want.  There are happy hour and late night specials and combos you can order. There are other options on the menu but you really should try the cheese steak sandwich. I recommend the Old Bay fries.",
  "Great bar for after work. They have a really good rotating selection of craft beers. My only complaint is that the beer taps need to be cleaned ASAP. Have noticed a weird moldy/cleaner aftertaste on every beer I\u2019ve had there every time I\u2019ve gone. Have mentioned this to staff as well. Would be 5/5 if not for the aftertaste. Hope they fix soon and I can change rating.",
  "It's upbeat bar at downtown location which gets dead after 9. So it's a good place if you have to spend time with bunch of colleagues. Service though might get cumbersome as the attenders sometimes hurry up as their shift ends. But overall of you don't care any of that and just be happy with drinks and friends that's the place which comes handy.",

  "Really good cheesesteaks and fries at an affordable price. I've been down to Philly a number of times and the prices here and down there are pretty much the same. The quality is very delicious, the meat is very well seasoned and you get a good amount of meat to bun. This isn't my first time at Shorty's and they will continue getting my business."

You then add as many as you want from almost 20 toppings, and like 5 dressings or sauces.\nThe food is surprisingly tasty and fresh. After 4 PM the place is empty. \nOne star less because the seatings are a little uncomfortable for me. \nWorth visiting on repeat.",

The line usually extends out the door, but don't worry! It goes by relatively quickly.\n\nDefinitely get as many toppings as you can! They really make the meal worth it. I don't ask for olives or any of the spicy sauces on my bowl, but you can ask for the sauces on the side when you pay. Always say yes to the pita because why not? The bowls I order are around $11 and I would consider it a good price because they give you a lot of food. I typically eat my meal from Naya for lunch and dinner. Overall, highly recommend!",

  "The sandwiches are great, and so is the staff. The gentleman at the register was quick but friendly - it's like things happened quickly, but I didn't feel rushed.\n\nLook for long lines during weekday lunch hours, but the fast and effective service makes things go pretty quickly.  Despite the long list of sandwiches (there seems to be something for everyone, including vegetarian or vegan options) the staff makes the sandwiches very efficiently. The drink selection is pretty good, with Hal's seltzer, Snapple, and other choices.  \n\nUnfortunately, last time I took a sandwich to go they gave me the wrong sandwich - they put the wrong sandwich in the bag with my name on it which also had the correct sandwich name written on it). Despite this, I'll probably be back to get the Caponne (what I ordered last time, but did not get to try)."

  "Great food hot or cold. Fresh food.  Clean place. My favorite is the baked mac and cheese. Strongly suggest",
  "This is probably one of the least expensive \"food by the pound\" buffets you can visit in FiDi.  I'm basing this review solely on the basement buffet, I've never visited the upstairs restaurant.\nThe space is usually very clean and there are at least 3 cashiers available during the lunch rush hour to hurry you out of the place.  The food is typical chinese restaurant cuisine, but they also have a vast selection of steamed veggies and salad dishes for those who want to eat light.  There are food attendants on the floor most of the time so the food gets replenished on the regular.  They have seating upstairs so you can get your food, get on the elevator and eat in their upstairs dining area.\n\nI suggest you look around the entire buffet before you begin filling up your container.  It'll help you make better decisions and spend less.  Highly recommend."

  "Although small, this food truck makes a mean burger! The battery burger comes with a beef patty with either Swiss or cheddar cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles, and an aioli sauce on a homemade English muffin. I get it without the pickles and its delicious! I've also had the pulled pork sandwich (also served on their delicious English muffins) and have tried their falafel and both are great too! Even though there aren't a lot of people manning the truck the service is usually pretty quick. If you're near Bowling Green during the week this underrated food truck is definitely worth a stop. Make sure you have cash!",

The staff was very friendly and made sure that everyone had a great time. It made my first experience memorable. One note for first timers. What ever \"spicy\" level you think you like/can handle, try one level down and work your way up.  I can't wait to go a back.",
  "The oldest bar in New York City is Fraunces Tavern. Located at 54 Pearl Street in New York City, this place is both a bar/restaurant and a museum, both honoring the tradition of taverns in New York City.\n\nFraunces Tavern played a prominent role in history before, during and after the American Revolution, serving as a headquarters for George Washington, a venue for peace negotiations with the British, and housing federal offices in the Early Republic.\n\nBefore the American Revolution, the building was one of the meeting places of the secret society, the Sons of Liberty.\n\nThis place is not to be missed. It can get packed but the tavern is a really great place to hang with friends for any occasion. And as previously mentioned, it\u2019s one of the oldest bars in America!",
  "A fine example of the rich history of New York City. This is where George Washington hung out and ultimately said farewell to his troops at the end of the American Revolution. Fascinating collection. Seems small at first glance but actually there is so much you could spend several hours here. An historical master class. Lovely, helpful staff. Highly recommended",
  "Went for mid-afternoon drinks and some bar food, not really a meal as we were hopping around the many bars and pubs located in this part of town. We had a wonderful experience listening to some jazz and enjoying a charcuterie board and trying some craft beer. If you like beer and ones you've never heard of this is the place to try it. There are several rooms here to dine in but we were in the more \"pub\" style but we did walk through the other dining areas which are beautiful. Read up on the history, it's definitely worth it to make the experience that much better!",
  "I go with my wife to this great restaurant often! This is the best place to pass a nice evening.  I visit this place many times. The cooking is fantastic, the workers are welcoming and the rates are fair. I like meeting in this spot for a nice supper."

It was an easy choice to go here with a group who wanted a bunch of different things or if you were not sure exactly what you wanted.  The reason I'm off this place for good is the staff.  The servers/preparers behind the counters are some of the nastiest folks you will ever meet!  If you go here, prepare to be ignored and talked down to.  Not only with this place NOT even try to make the customer happy, I'm convinced they have some twisted pool to see how many folks they can turn off to the join in a single day.  There are a ton of other food options in the area with staff who legitimately try to make the customer happy.  I'm mot tough to please and don't generally leave bad reviews and certainly don't base a bad review on a single experience.  The staff here needs to pursue careers as weather station monitors in Nome Alaska.  It suits their people skills better",

  "Love this cart - the price is right and the guys are really friendly.  I get the falafel platter here 2-3 times a week.  Pro-tip, if you go before noon, they'll still be baking the falafel, so it'll be fairly hard.  If you go after 12:30-1, the falafel has been soaking in the chickpea sauce stuff for a while and it's buttery soft.  Makes a huge difference.",

  "We came here around 1PM on a Sunday with reservations for 7. We walked in, and were seated immediately in the upstairs eating area because there weren't that many customers at the time. \n\nThe menu had both breakfast and lunch things since it was still brunch. The drinks were a little on the pricey side so we decided to stay away from those for a while. \n\nSince most of us were already so hungry and it was PM, we decided for a burger. We ordered a range from medium rare to well done. However, all of the burgers came to the table (6 in total) as a solid medium-well. However, the egg in mine and the avocado were able to moisten it up a bit. The fries were good as well. The only other dish that was ordered was some french toast which was WAY too sweet. \n\nCute place, Food was Ok, Won't be back.",
  "Great spot in the Battery Park / Financial District area to stop off, with drinks and plates to suit pretty much any appetite, palette, or budget. \n\nPlates ranging from the sub $15 range and up to around $25, with options for brunch, lunch, and of course, dinner. \n\nNice location, setting, and friendly staff. A good calling point for local and tourist alike.",
  "No they do not have an ocean view. The service is amazing over the top. Each employee greeted us and shook our hand like we are movie stars. We ordered the surf n turf with fillet Mignon  and shrimp. Small portions for sure and the food is just ok. Our drinks we had are very tasty coming from Seattle it's hard to compare fresh seafood to land lock areas the fillet was tiny but tasty",
  "Had the garlic fries and a few rounds of Glen-12. I am happy with the price of the drinks. Though the fries were a bit steep, they sure were tasty.\n\nThe staff seemed happy about being there and eager to help.\n\nAtmosphere was nice! Big, beautiful windows and phone chargers under the bar.",

  "Rosen's at 2 Broadway is convenient for the people that work there, but not any more affordable than the other restaurants in the area.\n\nFrom now on, I'll take feeling like a valued customer over convenience and continue to walk the extra block to Flavors from now on. Their prices are about the same or less and the quality of food and service is way better there, especially since they have more menu items and more toppings for your omelette.\u00a0\n\nToday I went to Rosen's out of convenience and when I asked about my order I was addressed with \"what?!\" and a snark response which was not called for at all. This is the second time this has happened to me. They're too busy for good customer service or quality food.\u00a0\n\nAt Rosen's, everything is prepared on one grill which leaves my food tasting like every other food that has been or is being prepared. I had french toast today that tasted like bacon and sausage grease. The chefs don't change their gloves or clean the grill in between orders. If this bothers you as much as it bothers me, then express your dietary needs to staff at Flavors and they'll oblige. Flavors isn't as convenient as Rosen's, so its less busy, but that just means they're more likely to treat you with respect. The staff there also remembers just about everyone's order just by seeing their face which is an added touch. \u00a0\n\nHope this helps,\u00a0\nNathalie",

We had so much fun we came back the next night for the New Year's eve party. James remembered us by name!! Introduced us to all of his friends and made my husband and I feel welcomed! James and Jessica made sure we were good all night. Their fantastic customer service is 1 of the reasons why we'll come back to NYC! A chill and nice spot!",
  "We came after 11pm and still were able to order real food! We had one burger and it was super delicious, however, fish and chips  wasn't good. I mean fries is perfect,  but fish is flavorless and not crunchy at all. \n\nThere is great choise of beer and barman was able to recomend some local IPA, so we end up loving the beer and the place! \n\nWill definitely come back here!!!",
  "Good pub food, attentive service and an extensive selection of drinks. Lots of screens all over the place which I find  distracting when you are having a conversation with other people but I realize that sports fans like this. The venue was able to accommodate a group of 11 people which is a plus.",
  "Great place to watch a soccer game. Skip the downstairs tables and go upstairs. Prices are reasonable and service is super friendly. \nThey have plenty of TVs all around. \nThere is also an outside area where you can sit if you want to get away from the game atmosphere.",
  "Overall, experience was eh. Service was bad, given the place was completely empty, waiting around for a glass of water just doesn\u2019t make sense. Busser had to go find the waitress who was on her phone to tell her to get us a glass of water and take our order. Food was was fine. Waited 10 mins for them to change the channel to the game (again, the place was empty). Beer and wine are not priced on the menu. When we asked the waitress, she didn\u2019t know the price either. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a mediocre sports pub, this is it. If you\u2019re looking for an average serviced lunch or dinner, I do not recommend."

Service was impeccable, our waiter was very nice and patient ( we were a large group, so we really appreciated his patience). We all really enjoyed our steaks, loved the wine and liked the desserts too. We recommend their staple delmonico rib eye steak. From the sides, we really liked the mushrooms and the lobster mac and cheese. Creamed spinach was great too. Was very positively surprised by how great their classic baked Alaska was.

It's not that great and they put cherry instead of an orange peel and it comes in a small glass with tons of ice and charge 20 bucks for it. I get that it's FiDi and the prices are competitive and I don't mind the price if it's good but I was pretty disappointed. Other than that, overall my experience was good."

  "Very friendly and attentive staff. They were great! Super clean restaurant with two floors. First floor has a bar and televisions as well as some tables. Second floor is largely tables. It's a great space for large parties. Plates come with large portions. Salsa and chips were yummy. Though pricey for guacamole, the cocktails were reasonable and delicious. I'd definitely go back.",
  "One of my favorite Mexican spots downtown.  Great food and atmosphere.  The pork burrito bowl is amazing.",
  "What you can expect from a decent Mexico restaurant. The place is quite noisy. A good place to hang out with friends on a Friday night.",
  "I think I found my new favorite spot!\nThe server was so friendly and very attentive and thorough with our orders , we were in a group of seven for my goddaughter\u2019s birthday. The music was nice and the food excellent,especially the guacamole and chips, definitely get the margarita tower it was not skimpy on the liquor.\nLOVED IT!",
  "Super fun place. Great bar and food. Music was fun. Nice place to hang out with friends"

  "Good simple Thai food. Tad bit on the pricey side for the flavors. But probably about average price for FiDi. There isn't a lot of seating inside and can get crowded around lunch time.",
  "After some of the reviews I had my doubts, but this place is amazing. Simple, well cooked, well seasoned Thai food made quickly. It really warmed me up on a cold night. The crispy spring rolls were stuffed with ground pork and had a satisfying crunch, the green curry was the perfect level of spice and went great with the brown rice. I really enjoyed my dinner here.",

  "Pretty sure there were bugs in my pho. They were really nice about it and gave me a new bowl, and they said what I saw was black pepper. Aside from my experience, the food and service is great!"

  "Service is great. Their  bread pudding is delicious with nice cup of tea. Nicely portioned. the ambiance  is very comfy. Moderately priced for the Area.",
  "This is my number one choice for catering business lunches and dinners. They have a wide variety of selection whether it be wraps or sandwiches. Their pastries are d.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s. Their catering manager, Kathleen Gallo, and Chef Richard provide Number One service. They're always available and happy to attend to our \"all of a sudden\" requests no matter the size. This is an exquisite choice. Thank you for the almost 20 years in the Financial District. Kudos!",
  "I really wanted this place to be good. It\u2019s such a cute caf\u00e9 with a great location downtown. The atmosphere is really nice. But as soon as you enter there is a cold vibe from the staff. The service is hardly what one might cal \u201cfriendly.\u201d \n\nThe prices aren\u2019t bad at first glance, but when the food comes you can\u2019t help but to feel cheated. Portion sizes are small, and the presentation is bland. I ordered scrambled eggs as well as an egg white omelet. That\u2019s literally all that I got. At least they\u2019re honest. \n\nNo seasoning. Bland. The egg whites were overcooked. It was hardly an omelette at all. Toast on the side. Perhaps it was buttered but I couldn\u2019t tell... it was so dry. \n\nAnd the side salad was literally just a handful of greens. No additions, spices, flavor, or garnish whatsoever. \n\nI wish it had turned out better. But I probably won\u2019t return. There are plenty of cafes in the city. This one has a great atmosphere. But if you\u2019re looking for anything near flavorful food or decent service, your best head somewhere else. Once again I\u2019m left regretting that I didn\u2019t go to McDonald\u2019s. At least they\u2019re tasty and consistent.",
  "Really cute shop! I went in for pastries for the holidays and I was surprised by how cute the yule log cake was.\n\nI purchased a chocolate chip cookie, the tiny chocolate mousse cake, and the tiny modern yule log. The chocolate chip cookie is hard on the edges but soft towards the center. It can be a tad sweet, but I can see how people would like to order coffee or tea with it. The mousse cake is the perfect flavor of chocolate. It's not too sweet or too bitter and it's a strong chocolate flavor. The modern yule log is made from pistachios, chocolate, and I think cherry? It's cute because it has two tiny mushroom-shaped meringues on it which makes it look more \"log-like\". There were macaroon shells on the end of the logs and they were surprisingly really good. I would definitely go back for more cakes or macaroons.",
  "I discovered that place while I was just working around the street after having a meeting with my friends . \nWe were crossed the road and suddenly I read the name \"FINANCIER PATISSERIE\" with his beautiful green colors . We were attracted to the appetizing smell that came out of this bakery and decided to enter and discover the benefits that were there.  The diversity of products sold We had left so amazed that I had to decide to go there 3 days later to taste the \"madeleines\" cakes of the FRENCH savoir-faire.\nBest place to enjoy French-cakes in #NYcity."

  "A reasonable menu mixing individual items and lunch specials.  Service was very prompt and attentive. I had the eel dish (unaju) which was attractively laid out on the dish but not especially flavorful",
  "I was a little cautious about this place at first because of some reviews and because of its location next to Wall Street. I thought folks may have skewed reviews about what good sushi is. The reviews are right, this place is very good. I ordered the King Crab dumplings to start out which are served in the steam basket. They were delicious! You get to really just taste the sweet crab.\n\nFor my main course I had the sushi sashimi combo. Every single piece of fish was very fresh! Each one! The sashimi melted like butter! It also comes with an eel/cucumber hand roll. Best eel I've had, hands down! Couldn't believe how good it was.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the lighting. I like to see what I am eating and in my opinion, this place is a tad to dim for me. It would be great for a romantic date though! Atmosphere is chill and the wait staff are attentive and what I really liked is that they helped one another out to look out for one another. I would come here again."

  "Omg the worst Lasagna I've ever had in my entire life!!!  The meat tasted like it was frozen and was just heated up slightly before putting it together. The sauce was definitely from a can.  The Lasagna  was very greasy so it made the sauce watery, and to top it off the cheese was very thick where my husband and I had issues chewing it... and i was also choking on the cheese because of how thick it was.  Im sure if they tried harder it'll be better but it just wasn't there tonight....  and we paid like 9 per meal so i was a little ticked off about that. \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude14\ud83e\udd28\n\nFyi they have food just sitting on the back counter its not covered at all.  Definitely a food safety hazard.",
  "This is one of many more-or-less identical pizza slice places in New York. But because it was very close to where I was working once, I went here dozens of times or more, and I like it. The pizza is good, and they have quite a few varieties of both regular and square pizza. I\u2019d usually get a couple of slices for lunch. The plain cheese and margherita slices are pretty good, and the grandma pizza squares are very good. Just thinking about it makes me hungry for more pizza!\n\nThe staff are very helpful and, like it says on the door, they have air conditioning!"

New York Cares actually chose this place to celebrate the achievement of the 2019 coat drive. I enjoyed myself so much that I almost don't want to leave here. It is very spacious in the upstairs bar area and there are many games that catered to all skill levels. Connect Four, the NES, pinball machines, the classic arcade section, you name it., they have it. I will recommend this place if you want to chill out after a long day of work or celebrate an achievement as mentioned above.",

We take our 9/11 Museum staff here sometimes and it\u2019s always a 5-star eating experience.

We also had the lobster bisque, that was delicious as well, could have more pieces of lobster in it, bit it was good. We also had the bottled Blueberry lemonade and that was very tart, would not get it again.  Location is great, but it is very small. There was no line this was right before lunch time. Staff was friendly. Prices weren't too bad.",

Huge space, very conveniently located but not a lot of effort given by staff or management. The massive dining room is a plus because you can always find a table to eat at or work from. They also have convenient outlets around for charging. I do think their coffee is on the better side and some of the pastries. I just really wish their entrees and sides were better. I will probably continue to frequent from time to time because of convenience and it's \"safe\" but still on the disappointing side.",

Many other eateries around as well that share the dinning area (Picnic Tables and benches). But the family voted for pizza. The only issue we had was the pizza came to us burnt. You can tell our server knew it as well and was waiting to see if we would say something. Of course we sent it back as I have boys who will not eat burnt food or the Mrs. The new one that came out was perfect. The fresh crushed tomato sauce really brought out the flavor of the pizza.

  "Solid food with good balance of flavor and awesome cocktails.  Only issue was that seafood pasta had fantastic tiger prawn, but salty clams, tiny mussels and soggy fettuccini.  Personally, I think spaghetti or angel hair would have been better.  But overall, pretty good. Will definitely go back for the tiger prawns and Greek salad.",
  "excellent restaurant and a good addition to the area. comfortable airy seating. welcoming, attentive service. quality fresh food and very tasty. generous portions. everything we ordered was very good including the complimentary bread with creamy garlic cheese sauce. nice cocktails and wine.",
  "My brother and I had the prix fixe lunch and were very happy with our meals. The atmosphere is very nice and the food was excellent. We will definitely eat here again.",
  "Perfect! It\u2019s the only way to describe this dining experience! We were so impressed by everything: the service, wine, atmosphere, menu and of course the food - wow! We shared several of the starters and one main and it was more than enough between three people. Complimentary bread but please make sure you order the octopus, lamb, spreads... actually - just order everything! And also make sure you get dessert also - it is life changing",
  "From the door to when we left we had stellar service, the manager, Robert our server we were loving it! We also had our mothers with us and Robert was so patient .. we had the off menu items because they sounded amazing ...they tasted even better "

  "This tiny busy shop knows how to do it right. They have a good variety of fried and  grilled seafood served up efficiently. I had the special of the day, fried breaded flounder and french fries and a soda, while my friend chose the healthier grilled fish with salad. My fish and chips was fresh, crispy, and moist without being oily. My friend's dish was also fresh. With the variety of neighboring cuisines available, we were looking for a place to sit. Terrace squeezed in a counter around 2 edges with 6-8 stools that 4 or 5 could sit at comfortably.",
  "A different kind of fast food restaurant because they solely specialize in fried and grilled fish, shrimp and seafood all tasty and well prepared with side dishes and sauces.  My only disappointment was not being able to eat it there since I took order to go. Their menu is very diverse and reasonably priced.",
  "Place is awesome. Just tried it today for the first time. Got the flounder and shrimp platter with fries. BEST Fish and Chips I ever had. Def earned a spot on the weekly lunch rotation !",
  "I frequent this unique place often because I like the good air that is unique to this place. The personel is exceptionally welcoming and professional. The service is remarkablywonderfully efficient. Needless to say, the food you eat is magnificent. I came more than once and I was never disappointed. The pay is modest. I recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.",
  "Terrace is a useful fast source of fish and chips in the Financial District.  Most people get their food,  typically lunch, to go.  Indoor seating is limited.  In warm months you can enjoy your meal on nearby outdoor tables, benches and walls.  The fish is tasty.  French fries (chips) are acceptable.   Portions are large.  You finish happy and satisfied."

The place only reason the place stays in business is because of its location.",

Thankfully you can eat at the bar next door as long as you don't mind relatively loud music.Bingo Deli",

You can go sit at the bar next door and they will come deliver the food to you. You could enjoy the burger with any adult beverage of your choice if you eat at the bar. Love that concept. There is a backyard patio spot if you do decide to eat at the bar and there aren't enough indoor seats. Kinda pricy as you have to order each item separate (fries, burger, drink). Very worth it.

  "A love letter to a bagel, and the weirdest Yelp review I've ever written--\n\nDear Everything-Bagel-with-Whitefish-Salad-Wild-Sockeye-Salmon-Lettuce-and-Tomato, \n\nI love you. \n\nI honestly didn't know what to expect. People rave about New York bagels: \"You have to get one!\" But which one and from where?!\n\nFortunately, you were waiting for me at Leo's Bagels, a bagel shop just conveniently close enough for me to walk to from my post-interview location. \n\n(I didn't even know Leo's Bagels was a happening kind of place until I saw the line out the door and a lady forcing her children to take a photo with the sign!)\n\nYou were listed on a special menu, written by hand, on a big butcher paper roll. I was tempted by everything you contained--I'm a glutton (it's probably why I always go for an \"Everything\" bagel).  \n\nThen, everything happened so fast. I ordered you (along with a cinnamon-raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese). The man worked quickly and efficiently. No time for niceties, but I didn't care. \nFinally, you and your sweet, sister-bagel were handed to me in a brown paper bag. I stepped outside, triumphantly, but also worried--where would I consume you? \n\nJust a block down and around the corner I found the spot. There were all the other people happily enjoying their special bagel orders. Love in the air. Crumbs on their coats. Cream cheese on their chins. It was ~magical. \nUnwrapping you was a delight. Seeing your exposed halves absolutely stuffed with layers of whitefish, salmon, tomato, and lettuce...it was inspiring. I held your toasty, seed crusted, bagel exterior with both hands, opened wide, and took a bite. \n\nAnd it was everything. There was nothing to complain about. There was just flavor and crunch and creaminess and goodness to experience. It didn't take long for me to finish. \n\nI can't wait to have you again. \n\n-Merly\n---------------------\nThank you Leo's Bagels for making my first NYC bagel experience so awesome. Also, that cinnamon-raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese was amazing. They're so generous with the cream cheese and the bagels are toasted beautifully. (I love that they're chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.) \n\nThe only thing I'm concerned about, is that if I ever move to NYC, Leo's Bagels is probably going to contribute to my needing to be air-lifted out of my house some day.",
  "Went early morning when they opened. Line was reasonable and moved quickly. Staff was friendly and helpful. I got a beagle sandwich with Smoked salmon and it was good. Also got a regular beagle with plain cream cheese also very good. I would recommend this place and eat there again.",
  "Breakfast with a \"friend\" in the Queen Elizabeth II Park several steps away from Leo's. I asked for the soup of the day but was told they don't have any at this location.  Is there another location of Leo's? The everything bagel was crisp on the outside and chewy inside, perfection. Yes, Russ and Daughter's cream cheese is better but Leo's is right around the corner. Stop in to Leonidas by the park for a coffee, it's incredible. The line moves very quickly, don't be put off by it.",
  "First place we stopped for breakfast when getting into town for vacation. Bagel breakfast sandwiches were really good. It was really busy but the line went really fast. No room to eat there, but that seems to be the norm. I would recommend this Place to anyone looking for a good quick bite to eat.",
  "Orders are consistently incorrect and the staff is rude. Don't even think about ordering for delivery unless you like big fees and waiting 120 minutes. As others have said, the bagels are good but bagels are good at every deli corner in NYC. Don't waste your time or money here."

There's a huge fridge of milk in case you'd like to have some with the cookies. At the time of our visit (1:45AM), the store only had a few flavors from their full range offered, but we were more than happy to order two ice cream sandwiches: one deluxe and one regular.\n\nDelicious, gooey goodness. Milk and cookies has long since lost its crown to ice cream, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The cookies are well made, not too dense but also not too crumbly. The ice cream is creamy, melty, and seeps into the cookies when they do. It's a perfect late night snack, afternoon dessert, and celebratory bite to eat.\n\nThe staff is super enthusiastic despite the late hour of our visit, so props to the midnight crew! Y'all are killing it, and we see + appreciate that energy. Keep it up!",
  "There\u2019s a good reason the line is always out the door! ...Always freshly baked and chocolate chip cookies are always the perfect cheat \ud83d\ude4a",
  "Insomnia cookies ! Great place and delicious cookies! Definitely a go to spot whenever You\u2019re around! Friendly inviting staff, small area with limited seating and it may get crowded but it\u2019s worth the wait!",
  "*HEALTH RISK* \n\nCame into the store and was ignored by (presumably) female manager who was listening to music. More helpful staff member came out from the back of the kitchen to greet me and offer service. Started ordering however became distracted by female manager arguing with another employee. Also noticed no safety equipment being used i.e. masks, gloves, arguing over my open cookie box - at this point I decided to cancel the order and leave. \n\nUsed to enjoy this shop but simply one too many rude encounters to continue patronage here. Concern if low staff standards will contribute to wider health risks of their customers.",
  "We've experienced Insomnia in a few places across the nation. Frankly they're not very well known - I don't think they put a lot of money into marketing - but that just qualifies them as a \"best kept secret\". We've always walked in after finding them accidentally somewhere, but fresh-baked still-warm cookies delivered to your door (almost) anytime? YES PLEASE."

  "Calling all coffee lovers- I recently had the pleasure of trying this new coffee shop and i enjoyed it wholeheartedly. This is their newer location in the Financial district. This is a dope coffee spot. First of all, they grow and roast their own coffee! That\u2019s pretty cool! Also, they have rum infused coffee beans. Have you heard of anything cooler? The staff is beyond friendly, and knowledgeable. Their coffee is amazing, the brownies, the almond danish is OMG amazing! Give this place a try!",

  "787 on pearl is a must stop! The best coffee I have had in a while. I would try the rum infused coffee and pastries on the side. In the financial district, a absolute hidden gem. The owner is so nice and employees are coffee brewing stars. Every thing is in house and you can truly tell that it is by the quality. Need a quite cozy place for a quick break to recharge from your hectic day? You found the place!!",
  "The employees are so genuine and make some amazing coffee. They have offers for people who are local (aka work near by) which shows how much they care about their neighbors. I suggest getting something to go or to stay in their cute/spacious place.",
  "This cafe has outstanding customer service. Everyone who works here is incredibly friendly and helpful. Staff checked in regularly to make sure we had enough water and assisted us when they noticed we needed outlets for work. They were incredibly open to answering questions. Unfortunately, I did not know they served empanadas, or I would have gladly eaten here instead."

All of the people who love and adore me would love if I had this guy's chill personality; truth be told, so do I!  I AM almost never in this part of Manhattan, but was so happy to stop for a coffee at this location earlier today.",
  "A cute little coffee cart in Fidi! The barista is super friendly and hospitable. He definitely has a good sense of humor too! It's a great place to get quick coffee to-go. They accept apple pay!!! I'm always relieved to not have to dig into my bag to find my wallet. \nAll in all, great service and good coffee. I got an iced oat cortado with a dark chocolate flavor shot. I usually like to taste the bitterness of the espresso in my coffee which was slightly missing. It could've been overpowered with the chocolate. Regardless, it was delicious and I would love to stop by and try something new the next time I am around! \n\nUpdate - this place has become my favorite coffee spot in FiDi! I tried it a couple more times and fell in love. I would like to revise my previous review and comment that with the latte, the espresso and dark chocolate was completely balanced! \n\nP.S. - the sun wasn't very cooperative in the pictures I took, sorry about the quality!",

This place is also perfect for a romantic walk along the waterfront. It provides a wonderful view of the two bridges. Not Two Bridges the neighborhood, but the two bridges of the area, the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. As well as a wonderful view of the East River and DUMBO Brooklyn (Downtown).",

  "The dog park is fine. All dogs are playful here and behaved. Just a warm reminder, if you see a lady and tell you she is the manager of the dog park , IGNORE HER. This is a public dog park owned by NYC gov, there is nothing such as a \u201cmanager\u201d. I met that lady twice and one time she just yelled at me said she was the manager, she doesn\u2019t want to see me and my dog here anymore. A VERY RUDE AND AGGRESSIVE \u201cmanager\u201d? I have been going to this dog park for almost a year, everything is nice here besides the \u201cmanager\u201d lady. My friends : you are all welcome to walk your dog and let them play here, nobody is legal to kick you out! \n\n(Btw, if that lady see my post, next time when ya yelled at me, I am going to call the local police, you are very rude and racist )",

I would still recommend The Fulton for date nights, celebrations, or as a nice place to grab dinner with friends.",

When I came back again I convinced most of my party to also get the salmon and they loved it too. The mussels are good and so is the shrimp cocktail but the standout appetizer is the soft shell crab - it is phenomenal. And don\u2019t miss the strawberry dessert!",

Lovely and cozy warm lighting and a super friendly and cool waitstaff. The lobster dish, which comes with a hefty price tag, is so well worth it and delicious it blew my mind. Just go!"

  "Well, there's no shortage of words to describe this absolute beast of a monument. Contrary to the pictures everyone posts from up on it, I'm opting to post pictures from night below and around it. Be it romantic, memorable, jaw dropping, be it anything Brooklyn bridge delivers. I'll let the professionals and the photogenics post pictures from up top, while I'll give those who prefer aesthetics a view of what they could click. Banger of a place and if you're up for it, you could even dip your feet or hands in the chilling waters at night. This is the place to be at!",
  "Probably the largest park in Brooklyn; it has everything with basketball courts on one pier and a turf soccer field on another. You can even access it from two ferry stops. A great place to just chill by the water with fantastic, up-close views of lower Manhattan! Time-Out Market is so close on the North side of the park with great food options.",
  "Amazing view of the Manhattan, especially at nights! The park is open till 9/10 pm and has a bunch of sport activities that one can engage. It's the perfect spot for any occasion, especially on warm nights. If you come by car, just know that you will have to pay $2 for every hour spent at the designated parking area. It only accepts cards, no cash. This also has a great view of both Brooklyn and Manhattan bridge and if you walk a bit further, there are picnic tables as well as benches along the park.",
  "Love this park. Almost always over crowded and hectic but still nice to hangout with the kids, take a walk through, and enjoy the scenery. Wish the few stops with food and drinks weren't extremely expensive but that's gentrified Dumbo for you. Still would recommend.",
  "Beautiful park worth exploring. It's great to see the iconic bridge up close. I wish we had time to walk/jog across but the drive is beautiful too. You can feel the energy change as you cross into Manhattan. The park itself is wide open offering the best skyline views imaginable. This park a selfie backdrop moment waiting to happen! There's also a museum and lots of restaurants and shops nearby."

Such a great view of Manhattan and not too many people around usually so you can enjoy it peacefully! Was here around 2am in November for around an hour and a half and didn't see a single soul! Bliss!!!",

  "This old pier on Brooklyn Bridge Park was abandoned however the pillars are still visible and above the water. Outstanding place for sunset pics of Manhattan. Space for tripods is limited so come like an hour before sunset to get a spot. This hidden corner is like 20 mins walk from Brooklyn Bridge. Highly recommended!!",
  "Great place to spend a delightful evening and get some great shots of the skyline",
  "One of every photographer's dream shooting spot in if there are in New York. Here you will have a New York City Skyline view on lower manhattan side. \n\nTip: To avoid hassle get here early before golden hours for best spot to shoot, this will give you enough time to scout for best composition. Many photographers visit this place during evening hours.\n\n#PhotographyNYC #ShootingLocationNYC #ShootingSpotNYC"

  "We had a gift card for this restaurant and booked a table via a third party seating app, which didn't mention anything about the dress code. Turns out our smart casual attire on the day we showed up wasn't good enough to get us in. The receptionists didn't turn us away, but offered a selection of coats to complete our attire. We walked inside and were instantly treated like pariah by the head wait staff. When we asked to be moved to a table by the window, he smugly refused, because it's only for 'appropriately dressed' guests. That really ruined it for us. We were so looking forward to a dinner with a view.\n\nThe rest of the wait staff were pleasant and attentive, and the food was delicious, though not exceptional. We ended our meal with a surprise treat they gave us in celebration of our anniversary. After the hefty value in our gift card was applied to the bill, we still had to pay almost $300.\n\nPretty sure we won't be back. We're not the dress-to-the-nines type, and in fact shun the pretentiousness of it all. I understand that they can set and enforce all the rules they want and appreciate the gesture of the receptionists to make us look 'presentable'. But if you're a restaurant that calls yourself a 'cafe' and is housed in an average-looking boat without any historic or cultural significance, that specific rule really sounds ridiculous.",
  "Photo is of their signature dessert, the Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge! Delicious!\nCame at the end of a delicious vegetarian fixed price meal. Expensive for the vegetarian meal however. Beautiful location, we were relocated to a table overlooking the bridge. Service was absolutely amazing, a must go to restaurant!!",
  "Located in iconic and picturesque Dumbo, Brooklyn, The River Cafe has all of the makings of a truly upper class dining experience. They require reservations months in advance and formal dining attire. The staff were all pleasant and the service is top notch. Food was on par with most up scale restaurants. Though the overall ambience, service, and presentation was impressive, it's still  very difficult to justify the $$$$$ price tag",
  "I celebrated my birthday today in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a enjoyable evening and the restaurant was evidently one of the reasons for the fruitful event. The stuff  helped in a splendid style, the cooking was yummy and my friends were so  happy. We shall no dout return for more joyful events. Thank you very much.",
  "I had a fantastic experience here! First of all, the ambiance is incredible. When we first got the the dining room, there was a wait to be seated, so we decided to go to the outdoor space they had on the water. We took pictures there with Manhattan in the background, which I would certainly recommend doing. Eventually, we were seated and brought a complimentary appetizer to hold us over until our first course arrived. I ended up having the buffalo ravioli as my first course, and it turned out great! The mushrooms that were paired with the ravioli were really good as well. For my main course, I had the steak. Lucky for me, the steak was 12 oz. which is huge, and it was also cooked perfectly and tasted great. I would definitely recommend the steak to anyone who plans on coming here. For my dessert I had the chocolate cake, and my friend had the guava goat cheese cheesecake. As much as I loved the cake, and the Brooklyn Bridge that came with it, I think I favored the guava cheesecake. Overall, the service was pretty good, too. If you do end up going, I\u2019d recommend taking pictures in the garden out front, as well as on their \u201cdock;\u201d they won\u2019t let you down! As a side note, I must mention that they do have a jacket requirement for the gentlemen in the dining room. If you forget to bring one, I believe they will loan you one for the night though."

I was fortunate enough to sit at the bar and watch the team assemble and fire the pizza in the coal fired oven. It looked pretty legit to me. As far as the taste goes it was simple, rustic and delicious. The sauce was lightly spread around between the slices of mozzarella, sprinkled with oregano and topped with fresh basil. The crust was thin but still had a good chew. It reminds me of pizza in Italy except, I hate to admit it, better.",

I try to visit different sites each time I visit NYC, but I will be returning to Luke's Lobster every visit no doubt. Thanks for existing!",
  "I had a lobster and crab roll. The rolls are a tad pricey but I must admit they were delicious. I would definitely eat at this location again when I\u2019m in town. Customer service was outstanding. I highly recommend this location.",
  "We ordered their winter special Lobster Combo (lobster Mac & cheese) and Luke\u2019s Trio (with clam chowder)....and it made our taste buds dance. \n\nPrice is what you would expect for fresh quality seafood in a lovely location with spectacular views of the Brooklyn Bridge. The gentleman who served us today was top-notch. Definitely hard to beat their awesome customer service. Thanks for the Kodak moment ;)"

  "Great Italian food and service. We had a large party and the staff was very accommodating. I had the lasagna which was excellent, and a very good portion. My wife had the eggplant ravioli which she raved about. It a busy restaurant, so reservations are suggested.",
  "Great and easy to access neighborhood restaurant serving up homey rustic Italian classics. Fairly straightforward and approachable food and wine menu. Service is hospitable and all staff are very attentive. Food is well executed and delicious, and much comparable to a typical family-style Italian restaurant.",
  "Antonio, the chef-owner, does a fabulous job ensuring each delectable dish is done right. \nBe aware it is cash only. It is a very popular place so either arrive early 5-6:00 PM or be prepared to wait. \nEverything I have eaten here has been very tasty. There is a good wine list but the house red wine is fine and very inexpensive at $5 a glass or $15 for a bottle.\nThey make their own pasta. Whole wheat or gluten free pasta can be ordered for a small extra charge.\nThe only negative is that it tends to get noisy.",
  "Great location with a vibrant environment and amazing food. This has a very friendly, cozy energy with prompt service. Expect a wait during peak hours but there\u2019s a bar to savor a drink before getting seated. Solid wine selection. Great for solo dining to large groups.",
  "We finally made it here for dinner after living in a Dumbo for 3 years. Loved it. The wait staff are awesome, vibe is classic Italian, and the food was super good. The seafood risotto was the best risotto I\u2019ve ever had."

A simple margarita pizza no frills but just all the taste.",

Got a simple pizza.  Simple is always the best.   When we left we had a nice conversation with the owner.  They're from the same neighborhood in brooklyn go figure.  We will be back.",
  "My wife and I had been meaning to stop by this place many times but something would always come up. Glad that we finally made it in. The service was fantastic. Great to see that the servers weren't stressed and still friendly, considering the place was pretty busy. We've been to many pizzerias here in NYC and this is instantly my wife's favorite pizza. I myself am more of a \"mom n pop\" pizza type but this was certainly some great gourmet pizza. The garlic bread was EXCEPTIONAL, as was the meatball hero. Gonna make sure to stop by here more often when we're in the neighborhood.",

It\u2019s also really spacious comparing to other places in neighborhood or NYC in general.",

The server was very friendly and helpful explaining what was available and tempting us with more goodies. A highly enjoyable experience.",

  "I love this place, their ice cream and the location for enjoying a nice cup of coffee with a chocolate treat. But sadly, they have stopped making their pure chocolate cookie, a sad decision for us who were fans. Their chocolate chip cookie is still good but not the same experience. We still  Hope to visit again next time in NYC and find New surprises...",
  "Hot Chocolate taste good! But I\u2019d recommend to get the small one since the large is way to much. It doesn\u2019t seem to be so large but the chocolate is really thick!",
  "Best hot chocolate! It is usually not too busy even though it is in a very touristic area. Their ice cream is pretty good too. A must visit in the winter if you are around."

Magnificent views of skyline.The Empire\u2013Fulton Ferry section of the park is 4.5 acres (1.8 ha) of waterfront parkland that is directly adjacent to Main Street to the west. It connects to Pier 1 to the south. This part of the park was formerly a state park, but was incorporated into Brooklyn Bridge Park. It contains a lawn with picnic areas, as well as a promenade facing the East River.[150] Two Civil-War era structures, the Tobacco Warehouse and Empire Stores, are also located on the site; both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",

  "A great dog park but don't go when the dog walkers are there on weekdays. \nOne walker tried to hit my dog for sniffing one of the (more than 10) dogs that she and her group had with them. Another (from another company) was almost physically aggressive with an owner because the walker wasn't paying attention to the dog she had with her and the owner's dogs barked at it. \nOther than a few non-regulars, most of the owners are responsible, close the gates properly, and keep an eye on their dogs. The amount of space is great and there're a lot of interesting plants and trees to entertain your dog. In the summer it's really nice.",
  "We take our 13 pound dog from the LES over on the weekends and we have been happy thus far. It\u2019s a nice, open dog park right off the bridge. The times we\u2019ve been there, there were around 10+ dogs, all of whom have been friendly and there is enough space for all the dogs to run around freely. It\u2019s located on a hill by a highway entrance, and two local roads so parking is challenging, but nice park given the location. We will be back!",
  "Big space with benches under old tries. All kinds of dogs. Soil covered with wood chips makes your shoes stained in all kinds of weather,so just be ready and don't wear fancy shows. I liked the atmosphere.",
  "Decently large dog park with seating areas and a water fountain for dog owners and a great deal of room for your loved one to run around and socialize with other dogs, with many on the weekend especially but not getting the feeling of too overcrowded. Seemed a little drab in terms of quality overall but other than that quite convenient in terms of place being nearby to the subways and ferry"

I never did get the side salad, or any further explanation, it just went ignored.

My wife had a California Eggs Benedict that she loved, and my son was pleased with his Buttermilk Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, too. All the staff was very nice as well.",
  "Grabbed lunch here on my move-in day and it was the perfect place to refuel for the rest of in packing. Our food was delicious, service was great, and the atmosphere was just right. Will definitely be back here many more times! If they have the butternut squash soup, definitely get it before they run out \u2014 yum!",
  "Great area dining with outside seating in separate porch and patio.  Porch was a little noisy.  Food was ok i had, shrimp rice special.  Friend had the cod but had to send it back as it was too salty.  Service was good.  I would not be adverse to trying it again.",
  "Lovely restaurant, great food (plenty of vegetarian and vegan options) and fair prices. Kind and efficient waitresses, too. And a delicious pecan pie... an absolute must-do. About 12-14 $ per plate for lunch, well worth it.",
  "I had my friend visiting me for a couple of days and had to find a place that offers vegan/vegetarian options (my friend is vegetarian). we were not disappointed and even pleasantly surprised with a variety. Everything is delicious, food looks good too. The staff is friendly. Def a great spot to visit."

It is helping in the way he described. \n\nGreat product, great experience. \n\nThank you, Juice press.\n\nI highly recommend a visit if you're in the mood for a juice, shot, or smoothie - weather it be for health, medicinal or enjoyment purposes. The flavor combinations seem excellent and the quality is great. As a Juice Generation regular, I must say that Juice Press surpassed my expectations and I will definitely be going back.",

Very misleading should just say Bowl! \nBut flavor and serving were good (for Dumbo) had pork and chicken burrito bowls. I asked if pork was spicy was told no, ended up having giant pieces of jalapenos in it, which I dislike, so I was left unsatisfied picking at my friend's chicken bowl. Doubt I'd personally go here again, but wasnt horrible.",

I got sausage, pepperoni, and olive, and all the toppings were applied perfectly in the correct amounts. The pizza was hot, the crust was chewy, the cheese was gooey, and the sauce was flavorful. The pizza was a tad greasy, but nothing a quick dabbing with a napkin couldn't fix. I'll absolutely order from here any time I'm in Berkeley: it's worth the odd ordering process and hoop jumping.Love & Dough"

  "Very disappointing espresso - tasted like either a very unclean machine, or re-run grounds, or the wrong kind of bean. There are so many coffee shops in the area - I'd recommend venturing elsewhere to get your coffee fix."

  "Stumbled upon this place on our walk through DUMBO. The barista guy greeted us immediately. SUPER DUPER FRIENDLY, PLEASANT, and attentive. The guy seems to be unable to stop smiling! He's awesome and adorable!\n\nAnyway, our drinks came out pretty quick and were delicious. The strawberry lava milk tea is a flavor explosion. Def recommend!",
  "Very nice spot! Super cozy. The boba was yummy. Also tried the tarp egg pudding which was delicious",
  "Super friendly service and the ice cream flavors are fabulous!! Unique flavors like Jasmine and Palm seed and perfectly balance in sweetness and natural flavor. So refreshing to taste ice cream that is not loaded with sugar.",
  "Super friendly baristas. We were met at the door and walked to the coffee bar. The lavender latte was delicious and I sampled the strawberry lava milk tea, which was punch-you-in-the-face good. I'm not a big fan of matcha but the sip I tried was still pretty good.\n\nI'm glad we stopped here on a whim!",
  "Helpful staff, cozy venue and delicious drinks. I got the Taro milk tea and added egg pudding topping per the recommendation of the staff. Would come again."

  "First & foremost, I'm not a fan of 'dog runs'.  Would much rather take my dog to a real park such as Fort Greene park or hiking to New Jersey.  I do agree with one of the previous posters that the hill is a weird fixture.  However, the real reason behind my three stars which I am surprised nobody has mentioned is that the run is right underneath the trains.  The noise is simply intolerable to me, it raises my stress levels as I am sure it does my dog's.  Do yourself a favor and drive your dog out hiking once a week, and for the rest of the time, just walk them on the streets."

I came here for brunch and got the eggs and tomatoes (which is a similar version to a dish called Shakshukah), and their absolute amazing pear sourdough pancakes.. this pancake is out of the world! It\u2019s more like a very well fried donut type of pancake, it\u2019s thick and made perfect on the inside, topped with butter and maple syrup, you really done need more than that. We also got the grits which were pretty good. Highly recommend to check their brunch menu, however it is a small food menu.",
  "Lovely atmosphere, great food and fast service. What else do you need?! Great experience dining on Brooklyn. Highly recommended.",
  "Despite being in the middle of nowhere and having a small-ish dinner menu, Vinegar Hill House left a lasting impression on me. Everything we ordered was wonderfully prepared, presented, and flavored. The atmosphere is beautiful, rustic, and perfectly dim. It was bustling at the height of dinner, but never felt crowded or rushed. Highly recommended if you find yourself near DUMBO/Vinegar Hill.",
  "This place has a great feeling, like dropping into a dining room in a small town upstate. The staff is really warm and helpful. Really enjoy this spot.",
  "Staff was very accommodating for showing up much earlier than my reservation. Very warm environment... actually it was the perfect temperature. Had chicken liver mousse and salad to start, nothing remarkable. However, the pork main and eggplant side were incredibly delicious. Took off one star for my subjective opinion about the starters. Would have taken off only 1/2 star but Google Reviews won't allow that."

  "There's no love in their cooking food have no flavor price went up because of construction going on across the street, so they forgot about the people in the community who will still be here to support them when the construction workers leave after the work is finish. They need to bring back the Spanish lady who cooked with love and made it enjoyable to visit. It's not always about the the all mighty $$$. Lot of people stop going. Papi's get it together, the breakfast price went up which is not cool. Don't forget about the people in the community that you're serving.",

Think juicy roast pork and veg over rice with fried plaintains and that addictive salsa verde. The Cuban sando is awesome: ham, carmelized pork, nice roll to hold the juices, pickles and mustard to cut the heaviness. Humble digs, very friendly staff. No surprise that diverse patrons were streaming through. It rivals Margon and Sophie's.",

This particular location (on Jay Street) is very spacious, with plenty of seating for doing work or having a conversation. \n\nThe prices here are the standard for Manhattan/Downtown Brooklyn, so don't expect to pay less than $5 for a cup of coffee. That being said, if you are willing to spend that much for coffee, I would recommend the Brooklyn Roasting Company.",

Couches, coffee tables, window counter, you name it.\n\nThey sell a good assortment of coffee gadgets, brewers, and merchandise.",

  "Wow, where to start... I started coming to HVRMINN for their coffee. Paul is the man! He brews up the best lattes, and he does so with pomp and circumstance in his 3-piece suit. After becoming a regular, I\u2019ve become infatuated with their craft and attention to detail. There\u2019s a lost art in suiting, drowned by the leisurewear market, but not to worry! A suit that fits perfectly will be in your closet forever, so I decided to order my first real suit. \n\nWhen I finally made the decision, Minn, THEE head designer, was extremely patient and understood this was a big step for me. We sipped espressos as we flipped through their fabric swatch books. I was between two different blues, and he nudged me toward the more confident blue. I took his suggestion, and we got to measuring. \n\nThe measuring portion was perhaps the most intimate part, because the designer of all of these beautiful pieces was the one measuring me. At this point I got to pick button and pocket placements, so I could have my own creative touch, making it my own. \n\nTheir craftsmen spent the next few weeks sewing away, but Minn and Paul were always updating me when I dropped by for coffee. I received my suit soon thereafter. It was exactly how I dreamt my first real suit would look. Such an iconic silhouette! I\u2019ll be back for another!",
  "Unique playlist and vibe with quality coffee; just what the neighborhood needs!",
  "I've recently needed to shop for a new suit, as I've outgrown my old ones. I've never had a suit that fits me as well as the ones that they've custom made for me. I manage a personal business, but also work with many private investors, so being well dressed is important. They also have great customer service, and even took photos of me in my suit. I highly recommend HVRMINN to anyone who is on the market for a custom made suit.",
  "It has been a long journey finding a suit that not only fits properly ,but also is instilled with quality, charm and boldness to set it apart from everyone else. From my first fitting to the delivery of my made to measure suit , I was thoroughly impressed with the attention to details, craftsmanship and customer service. I was so happy with my mtm suit I had another made soon after and can proudly say I will be getting a few more to add to the collection! Oh and the coffee was excellent!"

We were in and out within 45min. Vegetarian/vegan options are clearly labeled and the server was happy to suggest dishes to accommodate. If you\u2019re looking for a veg option, get the cous cous! Sooo good - basically a giant tower of veggies and hummus. They have another location in Nolita and are planning to open a location in LA (Venice) sometime this year",

The service was very good I went very early in the morning the wait staff was very attentive the music was great the seating arrangements was fine overall aesthetic perfect for close casual get-togethers.\n\nPros: I really love how this place pays close attention to detail and all the food that was served to me the cappuccino was made fresh to order the cafe mocha had a really cool design on it I got a piece of chocolate along with my beverage I thought that small detail just made all the difference and I really enjoyed my experience.the cafe has a very intimate  setting the wait staff is very nice and attentive the selection of food provides a lot of variety mostly small plants like salad sandwiches soups and breakfast foods it's a really good place to come to unwine.\n\nCons: the serving portion would be considered small for someone who is looking to have a full course meal but if you like small plates or you looking to have just an in-between meal or simply to have brunch   this place will be a good option."

  "I celebrated my nomination yesterday in this great restaurant. Well we had a tremendous evening and the venue was definitely the reason for that successful meeting. The crew  helped in a pleasant style, the meals were very good and my buddies were extremely  delighted. We shall definitely return for more joyful events. thanks very much.",
  "A completely honest review after trying takeout from grill on less over 5 separate occasions and trying out 10 different dishes.\n\nI would give them a 3/5. They are decent but definitely don\u2019t expect anything above that, and the chicken and meats that they use often taste of low quality.\n\nCrispy Beef (Chinese Menu) stay away! The beef is disgusting and covered in an equally terrible sauce - 1/5.\n\nVegetable Soup - their soup is not bad at all. Certainly not gourmet but it taste nice and hits the spot. - 5/5.\n\nPastrami Burger - one of their better items on the menu. The burger is flavored well, though cooked a little too much to the point of being on the dry side. Still pretty decent. - 4/5.\n\nChicken Soup with Matzah Ball and Noodles - again another great soup. - 5/5.\n\nPastrami Baguette Sandwich - not very good at all. Pastrami used here was full of fat and not much meat on it. Bread was old and stale and tasteless. - 2/5.\n\nCajun Fries - I mean they\u2019re fries. Cannot go too wrong with them, and it was dried out but that it to be expected with takeout. 4/5.\n\nPotato Knish - not bad at all. 4/5.\n\nChilly Burger - its very spicy! If you like heat it is not a bad burger. Similar to the other burger above it was on the dry side :( - 4/5.\n\nChip Fries - these are very good! Much better than the frozen variety Fries, these are fresh and taste good. - 5/5.\n\nSweet n Sour Chicken (Chinese Menu) - better than the beef on Chinese menu, but still pretty low quality chicken and did not taste fresh. Stick to burgers at this place I would say. - 3/5.\n\nFrench Fries - boring and tasteless. - 1/5.\n\nGrilled Chicken - not too bad, moist and had flavor to it. Not best quality. - 4/5.\n\nBeef Egg Roll - not a lot of flavor dimension and taste like a glob of oil. - 2/5.\n\nSesame Chicken with Fried Rice - rice was not fried, Chicken was not good quality and sauce was missing the good flavor. Would not get again. - 3/5.",
  "I give 5 stars because there food is one in a million! Costumer service can improve alot... the staff is quick, overall it's worth to give this place a try.",
  "The food is regularly well prepared and delightful, staff members hands over excellent customer service. I loved the cleanliness and atmosphere. Keep up the good work.",
  "Great food fast delivery fair prices the Chinese chef is very friendly and kind gives generous portions \nThey have a huge menu selection \nOn Thursday it's a whole different level the vip plate chulent overnight kugel kishka jachnune egg matzah ball brisket flanken bone marrow with a grilled baguette \nAnd a great grill station as well with loads of different sandwich options and lots of sauces"

  "Decent bagels, but it beats me how they can be priced at 8 dollars each. We are in hipster Williamsburg, so I guess the prices are intended to be ironic as well. The lox (smoked salmon) was good; the crunchy fried lox was a little greasy. The bagels pale in comparison to those on Brick Lane (London), where they're more generous with the salmon, the bagels are bigger and doughier... and they're half the price.",

  "We had the Cocomallow Sandwich, which is a coconut macaroon sandwich with a toasted marshmallow in the middle. They have a few versions, like dipped in chocolate for example, but we were really excited about the one we got. It smelled amazing, but it was a little dry and not as light and fluffy as we wanted. Alternatively, it could've been really toasty and crunchy, but it was in the middle and not as flavorful as you would expect.",

The waitress was really sweet n gave us suggestions to complete our selection. \n\nOur food came out quickly, fresh and nice and hot. The waitress came over multiple times to ensure we were ok.\n\nWill definitely go back for breakfast.  This is my new secret spot.\n\n\u2764\ud83d\udc97\u2764\ud83d\udc97",
  "No matter whichever IHOP I go to anywhere around the country, they never ever disappoint me. The food is always very mouthwatering and delicious. The staff here was very respectful and friendly. Constantly checked on us. Food was made in a very timely manner. Was not that crowded at the time our party visited. Very clean. Parking may be an issue due to the business of the area, which makes it rather scarce to find parking, also have to pay the meter which isnt that much. If I I remember correctly it's about one dollar per hour, 3 hours max. They also have a take out section so if you want to you can run in and out real quick",
  "The worst service ever. I came here with my roommate to have a nice Saturday breakfast. We sat down for around 15 minutes until someone finally came to take the order. She was very impatient and murmuring the whole time. She also demanded us to pass the menu and the coffee to her. The only nice person there is the cleaning lady. She's the one who got someone to order for us. The food is okay. But I'll never go to this IHOP again. And I'd recommend you never come to this place.",

  "First of all I went on a weekend which may have had more of an impact on service.  The wait time was 25 minutes. There were available tables as well as vacated tables. It seems there weren't enough staff on hand to turn tables quickly. A manager should have been visible and helping. I chose to get my food to go. While I love ihop I won't be returning to that location."

That is just ridiculous. After waiting for my new order, I received a call from the delivery guy who says that he doesn't want to come up the elevator (like the first delivery guy did) and that he'll just come back in 10 minutes. I was so outraged that I contacted the restaurant again but was put on hold for quite a while until I simply just called my bank to get refunded. ",

  "Anybody caught the virus after visiting Food Bazaar lately? \n\nIn responses to COVID-19, the market is still allowing too much people inside the store simultaneously. With limited space, it forces people to unknowingly disrespect the 6 feet rule. Have to let more people waiting outside than the checkout line to lower the risk.\n\nSecondly, shoppers were allowed inside the store with no covers on the face. This has to be strictly enforced to lower the threat. \n\nI felt extremely uncomfortable after the recent visit to the store. Saw a short line outside and thought it might be safe. But caught a surprise after I got inside. \n\nPlease take this more seriously to protect your employees and customers.",

The menu is limited and always order want is popular to guarantee freshness and deliciousness.\n\nThe guy in front of me order a plate of chicken on rice and add some tomato to the list. I was drawn to that roasted chicken the moment we met. The decision is one of the best ones that day. The chicken is super juicy and well done. Meat falls off easily and add some hot sauce if you like. Rice is a bit too dry therefore ask for beans. Total is $6 cash and stop by next door deli for a drink.",

  "Some of the products are expencier than other supermarkets in the area. The meat and chicken are never fresh and on summer there are to many flies in the butcher section. Some of the produce are old and over priced. the sanitary condition of the cold cuts you order depends on the worker taking care of your order. I'm simply skeptical I don't trust them so I never buy from the deli department anyway. \nAt times the music is too loud on the aisles. Once you are deep inside the store and away from the windows if you need to make a phone call, You cannot receive or make phone calls like you normally do in other supermarkets. There's no free Wi-Fi either. most of the time the isles are full of boxes and is very difficult for two chopping cars to be side by side. Sometimes the isles you can smell dead rats and their solution to the problem is one cat. Four stars for the workers they are nice though and the manager Eddie he's a very nice person. Very pleasant to deal with and he's always eager to help the customers  as much as he can.",

Very few coffee spots or quick bite spots around the hospital, and this community Starbucks is is a much needed Safe Haven to take a 10 minute break during an arduous day in the medical field. Thank you Community Starbucks! \nSpecial shout out to the district manager, today he went above and beyond for me. Today a colleague of mine had an death in the family and was really having a horrific morning..... I ran across the street to get her a tea and croissant. Unfortunately this Starbucks was having plumbing issues and were not fully back online and functioning. Regardless, the district manager came out, profusely apologized, and explained they are almost open. I told him the situation and he got me the tea and croissant regardless of the plumbing issues! Thank you so much! You made my day and made my colleagues day! #PayItForward",

  "Love the place... love the staff!!!",
  "This is a very dirty, crowded, noisy, heavily worn Starbucks with a great view of some of the grimier parts of Woodhull Hospital. The service is perfectly fine, and honestly it's probably one of the better options in the immediate vicinity, but if you can get on the subway and go someplace else that'd be my suggestion.",
  "A Starbucks in this part of town is a welcome addition. Honestly, I was worried that this Starbucks would not feel as nice as others because of the neighborhood does not get the service it deserves (worlds worst post office), understaffed bank of America, etc. I was pleasantly surprised. There is plenty of seating including communal tables, bar heigh tables, and lounge chairs. Most impressive is the private room for meetings. As per usual, the bathrooms here are clean."

Very hospitable hosts, it is a happy restaurant to hang out with friends and colleagues or with your date. tasty  meals, talented  chief cook and stuff, decent  pay and attentive  service. Highly recommended.",
  "My son and I really enjoyed this place. The food was great!!  The staff was nice and made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely visit this place again.",
  "Bushniwa is a very nice restaurant with very fresh fish. I have to admit, the scallop and cod was done very nicely. The scallop was just perfectly crispy on the outside and not dry and inside was super moist and buttery. Same can be said about their cod.\n\nTheir decor is beautiful. However, if you plan to come and eat, bring your wallet, it is not for the faint of heart. That being said, you wont be disappointed with the food.",
  "Love love love this place! Service, food, literally amazing. Must go to in Brooklyn"

  "Spring rolls were pretty good and reasonably priced (considering this is NYC), I got the buffalo chicken dumplings which just seemed like regular dumplings with buffalo sauce poured over them, which tasted pretty good but nothing exceptional. Overall still a good, quiet, comfortable place to spend an afternoon",
  "We had a pleasant experience with this establishment.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  The Dumplings are unique and tasty.  5 stars status \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",
  "I don't really leave bad reviews but something is really wrong here with the glowing reviews. These dumplings taste like they're from the frozen section of a convenience store and thawed in the microwave. The Ramen broth tasted like milky water, the pork was tough and flavorless. Big yikes all around.",
  "Great spot in a fun area of Brooklyn. Lots of great shops and restaurants are in this area and OZI Dumplings is a top spot for delicious food. The dumplings are not what you'd typically expect. You get to choose things like the cheeseburger dumpling, or soft shell crab. The tonkatsu ramen was quite good. The broth was very creamy and full of pork flavor. Looking forward to going back.",
  "Postmate here. I've heard good and bad things about this place... So when I got an order for a pick up from here, I decided to place an additional order for me so I can try it. I don't know what they were, but they are NOT dumplings we are used to.. The outer part tasted more like fried wontons to me.. And the meat inside didn't have the flavor or texture of dumplings I've had in the past. They must think the flavored sauce they put on top is suppose to help. Over priced also. And W. T. H. was that brown / black liquid stuff poured in the middle of my white rice??? Wasn't soy sauce!"

The food was cooked perfectly, the portions are great for anyone looking to fuel up, and the sauces/ spices really enhanced all the flavors. The prices are a bit high considering the food you\u2019re eating, but that\u2019s the fee we pay for convenience. I also liked how you are able to pay for your food via a QR Code provided on the receipt! Average price per person here is about $24 (entree, appetizer, tax and tip).",
  "This is my go to spot to accommodate my vegan friends. Love the decor. Service is friendly. Will keep going back",
  "Some of the best asian food I've ever had and... it was all vegan! Hands down the best meat substitutes out there, you'll have a hard time going back to basic, stir-fried tofu after these delicacies. Getting to return to some old favorites since dropping meat was a dream come true, the General Tso's chicken and roasted 'duck' were phenomenal!",
  "Amituofo comes from Buddhism and can mean pretty much whatever you want it to mean. For me and this visit it meant good food in a nice setting. The atmosphere was laid back and casual as soon as you walk in. The tables look like they're made from reclaimed wood and it has a very nice repurposed feel to it. The service was hospitable and warm. The food was fresh, vibrant, and full of flavours. It had many levels of textures in each meal that we had and each dish was well executed. I'd definitely like to come back to see what else they can offer.",
  "Picture this; you\u2019re hungry on a real hard days of work at the studio with the boys. You decide to order some delectable vegan dishes and bam you got this flavor explosion of a meal. I ate every last bit and even scrapped the sides of my dish! That\u2019s right, I\u2019m coming out as a sidescrapper! So good!"

They played awful pop music from a decade ago; terrible beer selection. The waiters were quick and diligent though, once we finally started dining, and the food menu and food quality was unremarkable but decent.",
  "This place was super convenient to our Airbnb during our stay in Brooklyn. The burger was delicious and the doughnuts are amazing! Great ambiance. Only complaint would be that it got a bit chilly in the evening, most likely due to the plastic windows.",
  "I love this place hands down one of the best vibed out places in BK. You must go Thursday through Saturday because this one bartender really makes this place special. Her name is Gee it's short for a really long cool french name but she's very down to earth and certainly makes the experience great and welcoming.",

  "Making a list of places in NYC to get pizza. Put this one pretty close to the top. In fact, take the train over for this alone if you need to. Great pizza and great service. We didn\u2019t have to wait, but we waited on the dinner menu print just to make sure we had all the options, but I imagine there isn\u2019t a single thing on the menu that isn\u2019t good.",
  "Sat at the bar and had the Cowabunga Dude. It was delicious and an upscale take on the pies my parents would order when we were kids. I polished the pizza off myself! Generous with the toppings too. The rest of the menu looked great so I can't wait to try other dishes besides their pizza next time. Good vibes at the bar and a casual atmosphere. Will be returning for more!",
  "My all time favorite pizza spot in Brooklyn! From the vibes to their delicious pizza! They change their pizza menu often so you get to try all their amazing choices. They have a nice open patio that they open during the warm season which is a great hangout spot for friends and family!",
  "One of the top pizza spots! Thin crust, great sauce and interesting toppings if you want them. Like the vibe but on weekends be prepared to wait (or order take out and have it at the tiki bar next door).",
  "The place is really aesthetically pleasing and the pizza feels extremely authentic with their giant pizza oven. The crust is the right amount of crunch and chewy dough so it\u2019s not paper thin but has the crisp texture. We were seated pretty easily. Food didn\u2019t take long for a wait and the drinks were very good as well. Would definitely go back. (Sorry for my picture quality. It was a late Saturday night)"

Prices are very cheap, they have great breakfast Menus.\nThey have a very big variety of omelets, pancakes, waffles and awesome fresh orange juice. The place is simple but has a great vibe, the perfect place to fill up your batteries before you head out.\nWill definitely come back when I am in the neighborhood!",

  "This place is absolutely fantastic. It opens around 3am and closes at about 4pm. The only diner-style breakfast place in the neighborhood. Tina herself is pretty much there every day and she keeps the coffee coming. A standard breakfast plate (egg, meat, potato, toast, coffee) is like $6. They also have waffles. If you don't know, now you know.",

Light frills, in the cut style coffee place with delicious lates and reclaimed style wood furniture.\n\nThe day we went the fans were going and it had a warm airy vibe to it. I could see it being a nice out of the sun place for people to get work done or chill with some friends. It's cool, but not so cool that you feel uncomfortable.\n\nDefinitely enjoyed the designs that engulfed the building - it added to the experience of the place. Stop in and enjoy.",
  "Very cozy place, great to study or work - lots of seating. Cash only (which just screams tax-evasion!) and they clearly know how inconvenient that is for their customers because, almost as an act of pity, they have an ATM next to the register. Staff is not unfriendly, maybe just indifferent - like cats whose kindness feels more rewarding because of its scarcity. I've only been here twice. Food was good for the price, and I can't say anything bad about the coffee - it's certainly caffeinated (which is probably what gave me the energy to write such an unnecessarily long review).",
  "Went to Swallow Cafe for a latte with almond milk and spent about $6. The atmosphere was quiet, the tables were nice and clean and it was very cool ( temperature ) inside. I enjoyed the latte although it was pricey. The music was good, and the environment was really pretty. The metal seats were a bit uncomfortable though but maybe it's just me. Also, its cash only. Outside was interesting, it almost doesn't look like a cafe at all, just a wall with some art and that was pretty cool. I'd visit again!",

Lots of flavors come out in the food. The bread is a little bit more on the sour side. CASH ONLY . I don\u2019t really carry any cash, so make sure you bring some to avoid the ATM fee. The coffee ceremony looks pretty cool. Bathroom is large , but looks like it hasn\u2019t been renovated in ages . Food was solid. Service was quick.",

The espris is also a delicious drink with mango, papaya and avocado. Came with a large party and we got a few feast for 3s and feast for 2. Got to try everything and it's amazing. Can't wait to go back with an old friend to catch up!",

It was a bit weird sharing this style of eating with others, next time I'd prefer to get my own plate. Watch a quick video on how to eat Ethiopian food before you go. You will probably get a bit messy, but there is a faucet in the back for cleaning your hands, which is useful. All vegan!",
  "I struggle with this, the restaurant has been my go-to for visitors over the years. The food is absolutely incredible, second to none in terms of Ethiopian food in the city. \n\nThe last time I visited there was a DJ playing and our table was directly in front of the speaker. We couldn't really hear and requested if the volume could be decreased slightly or could we be seated elsewhere. She said she would check with the host and when she returned asked to take our order. She had forgotten to speak with host and offered to alternatively turn down the volume. Not sure if the volume was actually turned down. It made dinner tough. Nonetheless food was great! \n\nWill return, and this was probably a one off.",
  "Tastiest vegan restaurant in the neighborhood. Brunch on weekends from 12 to 4. The nan bread is amazing. All the appetizers on the dinner menu are great. Complementary coffee is great. Family friendly. Good music. Unisex bathrooms. Cash only. Staff is friendly. Lighting is nice."

  "Not NY style but I think NE style pizza. However it was pretty darn tasty. The restaurant bar is small but clean. The bartender was very nice and attentive. Go get yourself a pie!",
  "A pleasant surprise.  We were underwhelmed by another nearby highly touted  pizza place and decided To walk 5 min  give Archie's a try.  Cool little place with airy yeasty pizza.  Sort of in between a Sicilian and neopolitan in style.  Light, sweet and airy.  The clam pie was a hit.  Nice staff too.   Balance was achieved, we had great expectations for the previous place that weren't met and we had no expectations here and found a hit."

  "The food is the best part but the ambience and decorations are out of this world. You can spend years enjoying the view and the food and you will always find something new and exciting.",
  "The location is good, the ambiance and vibe of the restaurant is better, however.. The service and experience was not worth the wait or cost. We Waited for our reserved seats, ( during that time we attempted to get a glass of wine  at the bar to kill time, but the bartender did not once acknowledge us or anyone at the bar for that matter.)  once seated we then waited about 15 minutes ( no exxageration)  for anyone to approach us and even ask if we wanted water.  The next issue is we couldn't even tell who was a hostess , waiter, server or the manager. ( we had different people attend our table the entire time ) Waited another10 minutes for bread and to be asked if we were ready to order.  Then they  ran out of the octopus which was a bummer, but later in the evening when a waiter was taking orders from the couple next to us they had even less to offer them as we overheard \" we ran out of that also\" a few times ( felt bad for that couple) . The soup was terrible, the oysters were a bit greasy but decent, the lamb shank was very good, however the Lobster ...someone should be put in jail for how little meat and unsettling taste it came with..not to mention no proper utensils to properly break open claws just a big steak knife. My partner couldn't  even finish with the mess and smell. We had to ask for it to be taken away. It was obvious the restaurant had issues .. an employee (who seemed to possibly be a manager or owner) knew to voluntarily  come over and say \" I do apologize for everything this evening. We didn't expect everyone to show up at the same time.\" I simply said thanks and smiled  ..however what kind of excuse is \"We didnt expect everyone to show up at the same time to a couple who had a reservation\"??\n\nunfortunate and bad experience I do not recommend for the price of dinner we could have gone and had way better quality, service , portions.\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND.",

The staff were super friendly and attentive. The food tastes fresh and delicious. My Sangria was satisfying and served in a cute way. \n\nI was visiting with a friend and we both loved the experience and plan to bring our spouse's and family here. \n\nCan't wait to go back!",

  "The hidden gem in NYC Brooklyn/ Best VALUE FOOD IN NYC!!!\nBeen there now three times and as a somebody who loves Traditional Greek food and lives in Greece, I can guarantee authentic Greek Cuisine! As soon as you arrive, they serve water and being delicious grilled pita bread with olives. This place is GREECE in a nutshell...simple, tasty and incredible value for money! You have Greek radio playing in the back ground, service is fast and very friendly. The google ratings are really well deserved!\nHave tried most of the Greek restaurants in NYC over the years including the \u201ctop-rated-overly expensive ones\u201d but nothing compares to Yia Yia\u2019s Tarverna (Grand Mother\u2019s Tavern) ad the food is cooked with passion!\nEven if I never take a mixed grill, for 27$ we ate so much and still had to take the rest home!  The area where the place is located is very vibrant with loads of little resto\u2019s and bars in the hood.",
  "Excellent authentic Greek food. Lots of small hot and cold appetizers and dips. There are so many vegan and vegetarian options on the menu. They are clearly labeled on the regular menu which I love. The owner and wait staff is incredible kind and sweet and attentive. This is a must check out in the neighborhood!",
  "Yia Yia\u2019s is a special place. Not only is there food delicious but everyone is so nice and friendly there. Everything is so fresh, and the space is inviting and has an understated classiness. When I lived nearby I\u2019d order takeout from them on a regular basis, and now when I\u2019m in the area and want Greek this is the obvious choice. There\u2019s an outdoor area in back too that I\u2019m very interested in during the warmer seasons."

The cocktails were fun too, a Pho cocktail and a Pad Thai cocktail, both quite creative and intriguing.

I was amazed that the owner was doing everything himself. He should definitely hire at least someone to help himself out.\n\nIf you\u2019re picking this place instead of Ichiran, the taste isn\u2019t comparable, but it is much cheaper here.",
  "Love the sign outside stating \u201cslow food, slow service\u201d because it is operated by one man that knows what he is doing. The menu is right sized and so are the prices. A great bowl of ramen will run you $14 and it\u2019s loaded with flavor and noodles. The service is simple and humble. Would recommend for a first date or a couples \u201cdate spot.\u201d Will 100% be back.",

The fries were great, but the wings, not so much. Not the best I've ever had, and not the worst either, but pretty mediocre. Maybe it's not their specialty. The other patrons seemed to be enjoying their meals, so I'll have to switch up my order next time probably.",
  "Nice spot with great food. The chorizo mac & cheese was super cheesy but needed salt (& the chorizo flavor is almost nonexistent), & the French onion soup is too much on the sweeter side for my taste (but having a thick layer of cheese on the side of bread instead of putting those things in the soup was interesting), but the salmon was absolutely perfect. Definitely worth it. Great portions and presentation. I hope this place is around for awhile.",

The place is pretty quiet and not much to look at but that for me doesn\u2019t mean anything as long as the food is good. We got a Torta milanesa and it was really tasty. The bread was fresh and the chicken was good quality. We also got two tacos the al pastor was so good with their green salsa but the chorizo was a busy just not flavor. But definitely will go again and try the rest of their food. They had so much variety.",

It\u2019s one of the better Mexican joints I\u2019ve had in NYC thus far.\n\nHowever, the guy ringing everyone up kept eyeballing and overcharging everyone. He pulled the same with me and I just wrote it off as his tip but it rubbed me the wrong way to continue watching it happen and use a poor excuse whenever he\u2019d get called out on it. Be aware."

The location is good, it's in a trendy part of town. the presentation is absolutely beautiful, and they put a lot of care into the craft of making really delicious coffee. Lots of single-origin beans, and a transparent model so that you know that the cost of your drinking is quality and ethically sourced. this is a place for people who actually enjoy drinking coffee, and not just drinking a bunch of flavorings. Also a great place to sit and read or get work done.",

  "THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. No doubt the best specialty coffee shop in NYC. It's far away from the buzz, but so worth it. I've worked in the specialty coffee industry and know all the big names and Sey made it on to my all time favorites. Staff was lovely. The interior is stunning and the coffee fantastic (filter, Ecuador).",
  "Sey coffee is quite the minimal cute coffee shop with plants that you have been looking for. Rock your snazziest look and sip their yummy lattes and you will feel like you are in a short film. Staff seems nice. Mostly a lot of room for seating. Prices are a little higher than the average coffee shop, but it\u2019s pretty good and the space is awesome."

  "\"Your Way\"? Maybe if your way is below mediocre. I just wanted something simple, ordered a bagel and coffee. They only had two bagel options, cinnamon and pumpernickel(and they're a breakfast spot?). I asked for it to be toasted. It took almost an hour and it wasn't even toasted. Hardly had an onion or capers on it. I paid $18 for this!!! What a waste. \n3 stars because I know the difficulties of working in a cafe and I'm sure they aren't always this bad and the food delivery person was sweet. I'm still mad though. And, as a Jew, I'm not coming here for bagels. But the coffee is really good.",
  "Cosy and super friendly place with very affordable and tasty bagels, sandwiches, wraps and breakfast options. Selection of coffee/tea and juices. Definitely a go-to for studying,  relaxing or just treat yourself to some amazing food and/or coffee.",
  "They've made it my way each time, so far. I usually get a roll with egg and bacon. Today I tried an everything bagel with egg and bacon. It sounds like a simple meal but you'd be surprised how many places screw this up. Also, with my meal I get a small cappuccino and it's made perfectly. The frothing is to die for. Find your way to Your Way Cafe for some delicious food and smoothies. Vegan treats can be found here as well."

  "I can't express just how indispensable this wonderful little place has become to my daily life\u2014Foster Sundry was literally one of the reasons why I wanted to move here! Seriously!!\n\nThe cheese selection is one of the best in New York that I've encountered. The meats, including sausages, poultry, beef (that's what I've tried so far) are sourced locally, carefully, and just excellent. The staff are great, the vibe and decor charming and wonderful. Sure, it's perhaps a little pricey to go here everyday (I do anyway!) but boy is it worth it if you care about what you eat and drink as much as I do. I LOVE this place, and totally subscribe to all the values & ethics that underpin it. Please open a wine shop too!",
  "Wonderful spot with artisan foods, amazing meats, cheeses and coffee. The sausage, egg and cheese biscuit was superb. Brooklyn is lucky to have this place!",
  "BEST store!!! There were so many amazing specialty items to choose from. Their bread and meat selection is great. Cheese selection was impressive. Everything is so fresh. Friendly and helpful staff. Cinnamon Roll....game changer.",
  "For a pretty small shop, there\u2019s so much cool stuff. It\u2019s like a grocery store, but they only stock it with the best of the best. No filler. What really caught my eye was the to-go craft beer selection. Also, I tried their breakfast burrito and it was crazy good. I even found some fun gift ideas for friends. It\u2019s hard to describe this place, you just need to go check it out for yourself.",
  "If you like steak and cheese sandwiches, look no further because \u2018The Marv\u2019 is the best of the best. Delicious bread, generous helping of juicy meat, just the right amount of condiments, and the staff let me choose another cheese. \n\nThe drip coffee tasted off, or maybe it was the oat milk I added.\n\nClaim your seating before you order - the dining area is limited and people tend to linger."

  "I lived in these lofts for 6 months and had a great experience.  Only reason I moved out is because I prefer to be back in the city.  Hannah and Kevin (landlords) were extremely accommodating and easy going--which made a huge impact on my time there.  The loft/apartment itself was great--tons of light (plant lovers!) and tons of space.  My unit was north facing, so had a great view of the city and LIC from the living room and from my bedroom.  Neighbors were all friendly.  Rooftop absolutely huge and is a great bonus.",

  "I\u2019m living in Duncan Ford\u2019s apartment (see review below) and can confirm it is a great space.",
  "I've been a tenant here for over a year now and I would say I really enjoy living here. Well, it suits my taste, my life and close to the subways and simply a fun area to be in. If you like eccentric loft spaces with vast open areas and huge windows, tall ceilings then this building offers some of the most unique opportunities. It seems to me that management genuinely care about the property and try their best to keep it safe and clean. There is a sense of community which is cool and refreshing in NYC. I'm also one of those New Yorkers that bounced around all over the city..and I would say this is one of the more authentic and unique NYC living spaces I have come across. YMMV."

  "If you're looking for authentic Mexican this spot is legit HOWEVER they have horrible customer service. They're customer service is lacking so poorly it's not worth the time or money. First strike was trying to order food when the person taking my order didn't speak English, don't get me wrong I support legal immigrants but if you're hiring people who can't actually do the job it's a reflection of your business. Second strike was ordering delivery and AGAIN the employee on the phone didn't speak English, I tried placing my order they acted like they understood what I was saying and before getting off the phone I asked don't you need my apartment number? They hung up on me and I knew I was getting that delivery. Final strike, ordering a burrito for one, they have a card minimum, but they have let me use my card MULTIPLE TIMES below the minimum fee and I would tip them so it would reach that minimum fee. So I ordered the same item again and they wouldn't take my card although they've done it before. Instead of making a sale they lost that sale along with the money they used to make that item. Most importantly they lost a reoccurring customer. I've worked in hospitality for thirteen years, it's safe to say Taqueria Sofia ya'll chupar (suck in Spanish).",
  "Best chilaquiles in New York; hands down\u2014got mine al pastor. Great service as well",

  "Very cute place, lovely service. Delicious steak and short ribs. A real neighborhood find. So good! Recommended \ud83d\udcaf",
  "Delicious food. We tried steak and chicken tacos and steak burrito. It was super tasty. I would suggest putting two pieces of bread for the tacos because it melts easily. \nI took one star because the service is so slow other than that the place is worth trying.",
  "I love this place. Fantastic service, very friendly, very reasonably priced, and some of the best food I've had in NYC. I've never had Mexican food like this anywhere else (and I eat out and travel a lot).\n\nI've had 7 of their dishes and every single one was amazing. Their meat is cooked perfectly - pork chop, steak, chicken, seafood. And each dish is complimented by a bed of different vegetables cut to delicately sized pieces so you get a melange of each flavour in each bite.",
  "Amazing food, big portions, super friendly staff. All the ingredients are extremely fresh and every part of the dish is home-cooked. Looking forward to be back soon.",
  "I had the fish taco and half a chicken burrito.\n\nThe fish taco was light with a crisp taste that once bitten into gives you a satisfying crunch full of flavor. I only ordered 1 but I definitely could have easily eaten 12.\n\nAs delicious as the fish taco was the chicken burrito was absolutely scrumptious. Once I bit into it I immediately tasted the robust flavor created by the blend of fresh ingredients. It made me immediately want another bite, and much to my pleasant surprise I tasted  guacamole in my next bite. The only downside is that I was sharing with another person.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice for a crowd or a date although I imagine it's busier during the dinner hours as I was there for lunch."

  "Good coffee! The menu seems really healthy and delicious but I do not have time to try them. Will come by next time!",
  "Incredibly unwelcoming experience in this cafe. Upon arrival, the server at the counter proceeded to talk to a friend (who had actually entered after us) rather than welcome us, and we seated ourselves. When we went up to the counter to order, the same server excused himself, saying \u2018give me a minute\u2019 \u2014 it turned out the pressing duty he was attending to was examining that same friend\u2019s ring! When he did finally come back to take my order (after five minutes of me standing idle at the counter), his whole demeanour smacked of me being an imposition on his time. \n\nIt then turned out that the cafe had run out of certain menu items we wanted to order; while this in and of itself is fine, no apology was given \u2014 not fine.\n\nAll of this may have been balanced out if the food had been of a superlative quality. It was not. We ordered the Brazilian breakfast (which, by the way, was served to us while the server was on the phone...) and it was little more than reheated black bean soup. Such little care had been taken in its preparation that I found eggshell fragments in my meal (see attached picture). \n\nOverall, unless you A) know the waitstaff personally; and/or B) have a penchant for underwhelming and overpriced food, I would suggest that you avoid this place.",

I said good morning and he said they weren't open yet, kinda like he didn't know what to do. He left the door open while he was setting up the chairs outside on the sidewalk. I was immediately horrified that I barged into a cafe as they were still opening. I apologized profusely and tried to exit, but he stopped me and said it was ok. Since I was only getting iced coffee, he said, it was fine. He also said they were trying to open earlier, anyway, since people kept trying to get coffee early from the cafe. He did not have to take my order, since I was dumb and in the wrong, but he treated me with kindness in a way I haven't experienced customer service in awhile. This happened months ago, in October, and yet, I still remember this fondly and decided to share!\n\nI thought the barista was super kind, very friendly, and also my iced coffee was really tasty! This is a really cute cafe with a lot of positive energy. I would definitely recommend to people, if not for the cafe, but for the delicious food, too!"

I\u2019m very glad to have happened upon the place and highly recommend any of their sandwiches. I will say the tomato basil soup was a little lackluster, but that probably has more to do with my own preference for saltier soups. I\u2019m sure most wouldn\u2019t have that same thought.",

I was in the restaurant business for years, and think this isn\u2019t necessarily a reflection on the staff, but the management. There\u2019s never more than one person working, so when they\u2019re busy it\u2019s tough to manually input orders. We order like once a week, maybe even more, and have started to wonder if maybe we\u2019ll just get over your grilled cheese and give our business to more appreciative establishments.",

I gave him my $5. He just disappeared behind the counter and yelled \"Thank you!\" without giving me the change! A lot of people around the neighborhood has complained about different problems every time they walk in. The male owner is usually very rude. They do have a good sandwich menu but I'm not going through the trouble to see these people again. There are other better places around the neighborhood.",

The food changes from time to time so the server suggested that we take a picture of the menu and the drink menu to share with our party of 6 people since we were on the other end of the menu. We decided to order the following from the attached menu picture: (4) empanaditas (1) duck egg (2) Burrata (1) lasagna (1) pork belly (1) gnocchi with truffle (1) shishito peppers and (2) chocolate cakes (12) drinks and tip included, it came out to $407 for $68 per person. All REALLY good in my opinion but everyone loved the empanaditas. The duck egg was okay but our least favorite. Not bad for a Friday night dinner from 9PM - 11PM. Quick service and great environment."

The addition of dill and radishes, as well as the use of crusty bread, made it unique, filling, and not at all greasy and heavy. The atmosphere here is homey, and it was nice to sit out on their little porch space. Overall a great neighborhood spot!"

I suppose I mumble too much and was given a cow cheese pie and pepperoni knots but they were so nice and quick to remake my order I didn't care at all. The owner even offered to deliver my order for free but I was in no rush so I waited inside. I was a little sad they forgot the marinara for the knots the second time around and I didn't notice until I got home but whatever, the knots are delicious on their own. Tony's is the all-time best ever. Just look at that perfect pie! I honestly can't think of a time I haven't left this place a happier person. From their massive variety of slices and pies to their ample selection of incredible desserts they have consistently damn good food down pat. No need to go anywhere else for this kind of cuisine. Everyone needs to support them. I'll be back soon!",

They have upgraded so much that the prices have gone up substantially but the food is worth it.

I used to go there as a teen now my grown kids even go there. They have been here forever and the food is hella good. Our favorite is their Lasagnas.",

  "Old school NY pizza. Probably the best slices in bushwick. The Pizza man always makes sure the slices are adequately reheated so that\u2019s a win in my book. There is a slight credit card charge, I would say it\u2019s worth it. Need to take a picture of the slices one of these days.",

  "Nice portions of well prepared and tasty food.  Restaurant ambience (as opposed to trying to cram in a South American experience).  Could easily take a date here, or a small family.  I had several appetizers as opposed to a main meal, washed down by a sangria.  Was more than pleased with a blackened blood sausage, a rarity that most people shy away from; absolutely delicious.  Would love to return here to try the entire menu, but am based too far away in Jersey City."

The nachos came in a portion that was an afterthought. I have ordered here before and had a similar experience. Im sorry I never review but I had to. This was another disappointment.",

We got two of the specials from the menu. We had to close our eyes and comfort each other while we tried to swallow the juices of hell one by one. A logical person would send it back, but we thought it's some long lost karma coming to get us. \n\nBut they use metal straws, so kudos for that.",
  "The pizza crust is light and airy and just the tiniest bit tangy. The toppings on the pizza were fresh and delicious and a perfect combo of flavors. And pizza aside - the salad and dessert were also total delights. Try the house salad and whatever dessert is on for the day. The flourless chocolate cake was amazing. The place has a cute reclaimed look and a great vibe, plus wonderful service and a no-tipping policy. Definitely one of New York\u2019s top pizza spots."

One thing I did notice was that the door was open which was not the best idea for it to be open especially in this weather. I asked politely if the door can be closed because I was looking forward just to take the time to eat in the restaurant but it was so cold I end up taking it to go. To be honest this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve noticed this. Think about eating here because you will be COLD. But the food is excellent & the waiters are just simply the best!"

  "Stumbled into this bar by chance, or perhaps fate. My party took seats at the bar, where we remained planted for several hours in conversation with the bar tenders, other patrons, and ourselves. We ended up blowing off our prior-arranged plans for the night across town rather than abandon the comfort we found here. Strong pours at an agreeable price, if you still need further convincing after those words of praise.",

The dishes are always tasty, the service towards the customers  is very good too. I visit often this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it to all my friends.",
  "I ordered the shrimp skewed with rice and sweet plantains. It was very good, so was the pineapple ginger juice. \n\nIt was kind of dark there tho. I need an extra candle to see my food. Haha \n\nI went back again and ordered oxtail stew with rice. It was wonderful. Such a good portion that I got to takeaway some for my lunch next day."

They had a wide variety of food, however it was not that good.\nWe ordered morocho and not only was watery, it tasted like water with sugar and vanilla- with a hint of coconut \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The bandera - the guatita was so watery, but it was tasty/ the goat also watery but tasty. The ceviche needed salt - had no taste, I had to add the non spicy-hot sauce (delicious) for flavor. The hornado was delicious.\nWe also had the arroz marinero which was just okay - it had imitation crab & tuna (WHY?!\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). \nI am Ecuadorian and know my food and people, and it seems that the folks that cook are from the Sierra which are not the best at making food from the coast. I recommend to have food from that region such as the Horando which was delicious.\nI wouldn't recommend to bring children either, it's more like a sports bar feel... they had a soccer game on and all the intoxicated guests were screaming like maniacs and cursing. They not only scared me, but the 3 year old we were with. We only stopped by because it had good reviews in Google. Needless to say, I will not be coming back.",

Went with 2 best friends and they ordered the tacos de mariscos, huge portion of fish, octopus, shrimp topped with avocado. I ordered the octopus tacos and wow, so tender and tasty, would so order this again.  The other friend had the veggie quesadilla, the cheese is friend and placed over tortilla, generous portion and so yummy. The food ended with churros and cappuccino. So good. Ck the pics out. Our server Dominick was so nice and his picks totally rocked. Will be coming back for sure.",

I\u2019ve had amazing vegan fried \u201cchicken\u201d before and was not expecting what i received. It was more like scraps instead of the breast/thigh size pieces which i was expecting.

Their coffee is super flavorful, which makes a delicious oat milk latte. Their pastries are by far some of the best in the area, especially the muffins. My fav is the blueberry, pumpkin, cranberry -- super moist and tasty.

It seems like Russian roulette out there with business that either take this health crisis seriously or don't.\n\nWell, this will be our go to treat now during these weird times.  The door was propped open so I didn't need to touch it and the owner was making pies with a mask on his face and sanitizing his hands regularly.  He offered me a squirt of sanitizer for myself and told me that he's overpaying for it, but he wants to keep his workers clean and healthy too.

My sister, who is a vegan, was psyched to get the impossible sliders (which were cute little square burgers, and were also adorably packaged). She also had a side of fries and a diet soda (they have a machine with all kinds of flavors). I got her a White Castle mug as a keepsake- very inexpensive, at $6 and change.",

  "This is an awesome modern twist on Vietnamese food! And watching the Vice documentary really brings the story of this shop to life. The brisket pho is great with tons of noodles and brisket - I couldn't finish it all! And note that the broth is mushroom based instead of beef based, so you can truly have a vegetarian meal. The shop is tiny so expect to grab and go or wait for a spot to sit, but it's definitely worth it!",
  "The broth is amazing! It is complex and has so much depth, also its vegan and vegetarian friendly. They stay open relatively late which is awesome. There aren\u2019t many seats so you have to grab them if you can; there\u2019s 6-8 seats total inside. I\u2019ve had the chicken pho twice now and it is very good- the chicken is tender, the broth is so delicious, noodles good, all good. Great quality bowl of pho. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and having vegan options. I paid 12$ for my bowl + tip. Service is quick. If you\u2019re in the area, I recommend stopping by.",
  "The flavor profile of the pho ga was discordant and too strong, which is my same sentiment for the broth. Chicken was not delicately poached but overcooked and too dark. I\u2019ve visited 20+ Vietnamese restaurants in the NY area, and I would not recommend making a stop here.",
  "Melt in your mouth brisket",
  "Overpriced for the portion size of the noodles, the amount of broth was ok. Bok Choy however nice it may look, isn't good with pho and adds only visual appeal, not  to the flavor of the broth. Bahn mi at 14$ cost twice as much as other places. Customer service was okay, they forgot to give me my drink  and when I asked for it they looked at me like I was wrong and didn't even apologize, however small of an issue that may be it's still kind of rude. Overall overrated."

The best part of this to me was the complimentary parmesan sauce given before the meal. It comes in a shot glass, but I could easily have eaten a soup bowl full of the stuff. I did note that the appetizers are better than the entrees, at least that's my opinion based on what I ordered. Sorry, I'm not a millennial so I didn't take pictures of the food. All I'm giving you is my personal opinion and you can feel free to disagree. Overall a 3.5 but there's no option for that. For a regular restaurant 3.5 is good. I reserve 5.0 for an exquisite memorable experience. I just didn't feel that here. Wrong setting for that.",

  "ECUADOR \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udde8\nExcerpt from Eat the World NYC:\nThere are stretches of Wyckoff Avenue, of course, that you should steer clear of these days. A combination of dangers and threats from fixed-gear bikes chained to every surface; large, apparently unshowered and unshaven men in plaid roaming everywhere, and the ever-present risk of drowning in craft beer get worse the closer you come to Flushing Avenue.\n\nLuckily as you near Myrtle Avenue, and especially when you cross to the other side, the ubiquity of women dressed like they live in the 1980's goes down, and the chances to find excellent food goes significantly up. One such restaurant to eat well and avoid the dangers of all these other things is a small Ecuadorian nook named for the dish it features most prominently: Encebellado.\n\nOn a second visit, with an unexpectedly buzzing late afternoon crowd, a bowl of encebollado regular ($12) was tucked into and savored. The regular version of this popular soup is filled with meaty whitefish, cooked of course with onions as the name suggests. With maritime themes painted on the walls, it is easy to close your eyes and smell the Pacific Coast as if you were sitting in a seafood shack near Guayaquil.",
  "Great Ecuadorian cuisine very traditional food , encebollado is to die for, prizes are very reasonable , they serve lunch for only $9 (see picture of lunch).",
  "I can't get enough of this place. This is one of the best Ecuadorian seafood restaurants in the area.",
  "This restaurant is a perfect place to go too, good food  great price range but the place is kinda small but still worth it",
  "The hot seafood soup or also called Sopa marinera is delicious, fresh, big plate, it reminds you of the Ecuadorian coast and culture. I truly recommend this place even though its packed , it's worth waiting for it,  you will not regret it."

  "This restaurant serves typical Ecuadorian dishes as well as lunches. The lunches are served Mon-Fri, and include a choice of soup, entree, and drink for a great price. The food is delicious, and portions are generous. They would definitely benefit from having a few more servers, as this place is always busy. The interior is not the nicest I've seen, but if the food is delicious, who cares?",
  "The servers had us waiting for a while to be seated and food took for ever but when our food came it was definitely worth the wait. Authentic Ecuadorian at its best !",

  "We ordered sopa de pata and bistec encebollado. Both dishes were delicious, big portions and according to my bf who is Ecuadorian, the flavors were spot-on authentic.  Service is good, and even though our food took a while to come out, it didn't disappoint. The aj\u00ed was the perfect spice level for me (really spicy) and I shared my rice because it was a lot for my dish. We've been to this place a few times and it's always been good. It's Cash only, so be prepared.",

Bought 3 sandwiches and a couple of snacks and they tried to charge me over $40 on food. He didn\u2019t even even put the amount on the register just did the calculations on his head. When I told him to double check it on the register he got mad and started talking in his language with the other person there aggressively and and laughing in front of us. It turned out that it was no where near the $40 he was trying to charge me. It something that has happened more than one time and ppl should know the kind of things the actual owner does. The rest of his employees don\u2019t do that but when the actual owner is there beware because he\u2019s the one that overcharges.",

  "I came here on a Sunday night around 5:30PM with a friend who lives nearby, and I got their pan de bono and an empanada de carne. The pan de bono was amazing! It was quite warm when I got both items, and the pan de bono was delicious. Very cheesy with chewy bread, and it was very buttery which I didn't like. I ended up getting a second one of these. The empanada came with a little plastic container of green sauce which was delicious, but there wasn't enough of it. The inside of the empanada was super bland and needed the green sauce to make up for it, but there wasn't enough green sauce. The empanada was super potato-y and there wasn't much meat flavor. I actually didn't really like the empanada. But definitely the pan de bono! It was also a bit pricey at $1.50 for the bread and $1.75 for a tiny empanada.",

My favorite thing  here is the Guatamalan hot chocolate with espresso. Best hot chocolate in the neighborhood imo.\nLast thing I want to mention, is the service.

Anyways I ordered a cemita plus 4 TACOS to go and I only got one small green sauce!?!?!?! with those prices...? ps at night its full of drunkies.\nPrimeramente la comida esta cara, segundo como vas a nombrar tu restaurante guadalajara y no vender por lo menos la torta ahogada.",
  "The tacos are SO FILLING, even the veggie option! I tried to get the shrimp soup but they recommended the oxtail instead and I'm so thankful bc it is so good! I have yet to eat an oxtail but the broth and veggies (potatoes, green beans) are absolutely fantastic. If this soup is available without the oxtail pls lmk bc I need it in my life. Beware: ya might get ramen/pho sweats.",
  "Food is overpriced. While I was paying the cashier I left my daughter finishing her meal they just took my plate with out asking if I was done or not wouldn't recommend this place",
  "Food is excellent and waitress she is really nice and helpful.",
  "Never visited the store/restaraunt front and decided to go dosn there instead of the usual Seamless order. The restaraunt as more to chose from on thr menu vs. Seamless menu. Delicious and fresh authentic Mexican cuisine."

  "Went to take my wife out for a anniversary gift with kids and the place is okay. Not too fancy. 1st- the food was way overpriced. 2nd- almost every dish (they barely have anything to be honest) was old or cold. And most were empty. The quality of the food itself is pretty explanatory just look at the pictures. The pizza was HORRIBLE. At the end of the night I was very disappointed and just couldn\u2019t believe this is where I ended up taking my wife and kids. Would NOT recommend to anyone. PLEASE GO TO THE QUEENS BUFFET INSTEAD, that place has much variety and isn\u2019t as bad as this.",

  "Was recommended by a friend, I have no idea what was so great about it. As I was searching through what to eat I saw a roach as well. Will not go back again. Horrible staff as well, staring and talking about us as we looked around."

Then she dropped off the food and didn't come back until 5 minutes after I had piled the plates on the end of the table. We asked for the check and apparently one lady told the other and in the end we had to get up to get the check from someone at the bar because no one brought to us. Sad thing is that it hasn't been the only time. If their food wasn't so good I would never ever go back there.",
  "The cold and uninviting atmosphere was matched by the cold food and uninviting attitude of our waitress. If I could give 0 stars, I would.\n\nEveryone\u2019s food arrived cold. Rice was clearly left over from a previous day. They tried to get around not having one of the dishes we ordered by adding some of the ingredients to a very different dish and claiming it was what we ordered.\n\nWaitress kept rubbing her nose while taking our order. Disgusting. There were people so drunk they were practically falling off their stools at the bar at 1 in the afternoon but still being served more drinks. Irresponsible.\n\nFood is too expensive to be such a low quality experience.",

I was going to Popeyes fried chicken but it was further down and i was running late. I will probably never eat there again. By the way to conclude the chicken posted on pictures when place comes up on maps is FAR from what u get. Very nice looking in photos. The woman behind the counter is neither polite or nice.

  "Wish I could leave a 0 star review for them. I ordered via grubhub and they took over an hour and a half to deliver the food. Food was delivered cold and when I contacted them the guy gave me an attitude saying it was my fault for not putting the right number when I put the number in the delivery instructions. And then refused to refund the order. Absolute waste of money.",
  "Decent prices but mediocre tacos. Quesadilla cheese wasn't fully melted and tortillas tasted stale and filled with way to much lettuce to meat ratio. Seasoning and salsa was bland and non existent. Would not recommend despite the quick service.",
  "If you are busy or don't have time for enjoy a good mexican meal. They just prepare tacos,  burritos etc for take out or delivery"

However, they chose to turn the plastic containers upside down when they put the food in so that they would have to put less in. Missing out on a few bites isn't a huge deal for me but they did this for all 3 of my orders. I've never seen a Chinese place do this. It's more about the principle of it to me, I have no doubt they consciously turned the containers upside down in order to include less food. Pictures below. Won't be ordering here again",

Our drinks and food got cold quickly and I felt chilled. I wonder why the restaurant doesn\u2019t utilize an outer door as a shell as most restaurants do during cold weather; especially since the place is so small. I would definitely visit again though!

The portions were nice and big and we were excited to have food left over to bring home. When we asked to take the rest of our food to go, they happily took our semi-full plates to the back of kitchen to wrap it for us. It wasn\u2019t until we got home that we realized, the restaurant took more than half our leftover food off of our plates. After paying so much money, thinking we got such great service, little did we know they gave us a small portion of our leftover food, which we already paid for. More than half of my plate was missing. All that money wasted on food I won\u2019t ever get to finish. NEVER AGAIN!! If you do decide to eat here make sure to bring your own Tupperware to wrap your leftover food. I can\u2019t believe they had the nerve to take food off my plate.

The beer selection is vast but the prices are outrageous. The mixed drinks are worse for the price but could be so so good if just more $5-8 drinks. Limit the selection, curate the food a bit more (is it all american? Is it southern? Is it vegetarian friendly? Is it a coffee bar?) and get that website updated with a google calendar to list all the events!  I see on your chalkboard outside things advertised but when i want to be reminded of what happens on what day I cannot find the information!  This has great potential and is very cozy but just needs to have a price point to match the neighborhood.",

  "Nice variety and selection with fair pricing. Also very happy that the registers always ring up the advertised price. Not like the associated supermarket on Seneca ave and Stockholm St that's usually very expensive and has mediocre quality and u have to check out that you are charged the advertised sale price.",
  "There are many New organic products and very convenient for free parking.\nI love any kind of international items like Korean pear which came from Korea. \nMost Cashiers are very kind.",
  "Great supermarket for Vegans\nFinding a good selection of vegan food for cheese and milk is never easy, but this market has a surprisingly good selection and prices. Their frozen section is also good, but getting Quorn products would be even better. \nI now take a short train ride here twice a month to stock up on vegan options along with some other staple bargains. The staff is always helpful and friendly too.",
  "Above average variety of produce and certain food categories. Prices are mixed with multiple bargains depending on your needs. Definitely not a premium store.  Worthy of a stop if you are nearby but be weary of peak times as the parking lot can get crazy with drivers that have no regard for safety or driving courtesies.",
  "One of the best in town ..being going here snice i was born ..everything you need you'll find him ..good sales ..go check them out you would love it ...always a place to make you feel happy walking out ..believe that!!!!!"

  "This is the second time I have ordered delivery from this place, and the delivery WAS NEVER MADE. After 4 hours I got a phone call from a rude woman saying she had the pizza. When I told her my guests were already gone, she hung up and would not pick up again. I spoke very nicely to her despite how long it took,  and she still behaved that way. I would recommend no one ever order from this location. They wont change until they face serious legal action.  Clearly the management is using this technique to make money without providing the service. When I called the next day to tell the manager,  I was told they wouldn't refund and to try to dispute the claim through my bank. So they won't refund for food they never delivered,  much less delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I hope enough people complain about this location,  and they face the consequences they deserve. Very unprofessional.",

I'm tired of ordering a pizza and pay for the price of two. I recommend folks to order from another Domino's location. I'm personally fed up. Never seen a pizza with such a severe lack of cheese and toppings. For a time, I guessed the delivery guy used to systematically eat my cheese... You do what you want people. But on my part, I won't order again. It's over now.",

If your whole schedule 6 days out of the week is till 2, what is the overall difference in closing an hour earlier on Sunday. I know it\u2019s a rather petty issue but it doesn\u2019t make any sense. Mine as well keep a consistent schedule and keep it open an hour later. Other than that I like, but that Sunday schedule doesn\u2019t make any sense. Totally messed my Sunday night up.",

  "Decent pizza for a good price. Don't let the three stars dissuade you from grabbing a slice if you're in the neighborhood. Crust is thin and crunchy, I would have liked more sauce on the pizza, but that's a personal opinion. They gave me some after I asked for it which was nice. Overall a good experience with friendly staff."

I live 3 blocks away why is my food cold why it took an hour to get to me. And than they only give me 1 soy sauce when I asked for additional soy sauce its absurd",

Called the restaurant and spoke to Sofia, who was obnoxious and rude and refused to reimburse me and hung up on me twice. Never ordering from here ever again.

  "This place right around the corner to my house. And i have not for one minute gotten tired of bringing my family here. The servers are so kind and friendly and the food is just amazing. And they have. Happy hour so you know your getting a deal on those drinks.",
  "Hungry Burrito has good food, a great atmosphere, a great happy hour drink menu, but the service from the server Alex, was warm and friendly in the beginning and his demeanor waned as the time passed. It seemed like we were a bother to him. We were a table of fifteen and he forgot to put water in some of the glasses, and forgot to give some of the people in the party plates for their appetizers. He seemed to only be friendly when he was asking if we wanted another drink. Alex happily took our initial drink orders and even made suggestions. When he was given back the menu and told that we had reordered and paid for the food his attitude changed. I would recommend Hungry Burrito anytime to anyone. The food is excellent and the prices are reasonable, but the waiter affected my rating of this restaurant in a big way. I always say that sometimes a chef may has an off day or off moment that affects the food, but good service should never be lacking in a restaurant.",

I have tried a few Thai restaurants around the area and Mr.Thai is unbeatable for now. At my most resent visit, they forgot to include my appetizer and before I even opened the bag I got a call from them apologizing and informing me of the error. They offered to make it right away if I could come back for it. I couldn't, so they offered to make it and I could pick it up on my way home from work. I did and I was surprised when they doubled the item to make amends for their error. I would go back even if they hadn't done that because their food is that good. I recommend this place to all my coworkers and they have been abandoning their usual Thai spots once they have tried the food at Mr.Thai. An absolute must try. I give them my highest recommendation.",

  "Amazing bakery! Bought danishes with apricot and cream and caramel cookie with nuts. Enjoyed every bite of it . You guys do fantastic job! Even during this hard quarantine time you can find there one more reason to be happy! 5 stars, all the best! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
  "Never been disappointed about my breakfast. Always delicious. Very friendly staff. Super clean location",
  "Best bakery in queens. Everything is always fresh. The staff are so welcoming and nice. The red velvet cake omg if you haven't had it you need to go now and buy it. It's the best ive ever had in NYC. Just one word... Rudy's is perfection.",
  "The pastries is good. I took many things for my family and I tried many of it. The one that I enjoyed most was a yellow cake with pineapple filling and a white cream over the cake with coconut flakes on it. What they should do a traditional brownie with walnuts because that wasn't there. I would go again because the atmosphere was very pleasant. Didn't stay to eat and so I don't know if they have a bathroom or if its clean or not. Tables and everything was clean though.",
  "Rudy's Pastry Shop is a delightful cafe to have a lite meal or to grab a sweet treat. On this particular visit I tried the Mozzarella Melt; sliced turkey, sliced tomato and a generous slice of mozzarella melted to perfection!  Absolutely delicious!  I ended my meal with a cup of coffee and a small cannoli.  With its charming interior and extensive pastry menu, Rudy's is definitely a must for anyone wanting have a coffee and a sweet treat."

  "Well kept Supermarket that's pretty new around this neighborhood. Staff is friendly and helpful if you need assistance with anything. Fruits and vegetable produce seem fresh and they offer some organic products as well. Business is well stocked with many different choices to choose from on brands. They have a parking lot for their customers at the back of the business. Some prices on my opinion are on bit on the higher end but they offer many sales that make up for that. As a smart shopper, I'll stick to the sales and then move on. They have a small cafe food shop that sell food and serve beverages also. They also have a brewery shop with a few different beers to choose from. Still I recommend this Supermarket for all your needs.",

One person in the group did unlimited mimosas for brunch and didn't get her for until 45 minutes after the rest of the year.

They just have to watch everyone else eat, then eat alone?!!\n\nOnto the food.  The presentation was really cool, the flavoring not so much. Both the chicken and waffles were pretty bland",

  "SERBIA \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddf8\nEat the World NYC review:\nAs Ridgewood continues to change and newcomers with earbuds shuffle down the subway stairs at Forest Avenue to quickly walk home, I O Caffe continues to be the place it has always been for the last 25 years or so. With its dark, barred windows and solid door that offer no glimpses inside even at night, it takes somewhat of a leap of faith to swing open the heavy portal and step inside. The right folks might bring the jukebox screeching to a halt just like in the movies, but since I am Serbian-passing the intensity level of stares were simply at harmless intruder level.\n\nBut all that evaporates away pretty quickly just like it does in most longtime corner bars that only get a few outsiders. After all, the door is always open, I O Caffe just keeps to itself. And if this leap had not been made, a really nice plate of \u0107evapi and the friendly welcome would never have been found. As a group of men smokes and plays dominos in the back, grab one of the ten or so seats at the bar and settle in.\n\nThere is no menu, but plates of \u0107evapi are the main food offering. When salad and fries were mentioned they were not turned down, as it was the goal of the meal to try as much as they were cooking. $25 ended up being the total for 10 perfectly grilled pieces of meat over crisp fries, some bread, and an excellent and large \u0161opska, a salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, red peppers, and a healthy sprinkling of Bulgarian goat cheese. More than enough for two, had I been sharing.",
  "Best place ever",
  "typical balkan kafana. friendly staff",
  "The worst place ever! Never again! Rude people!",
  "Unique experience each and every time! Great staff, and the owner is a rockstar \ud83d\ude0e"

  "Good coffee, delicious bagels!\nWe decided to come here on a Sunday morning to get some work done. Most cafes in the neighborhood don't open until later but this place opens up at 8 AM even on the weekends - definitely a plus! My favorite aspect is the boldness and strength of their coffee - fresh roasted beans and delightful flavors. I tried the oat mocha and they use a milk chocolate syrup - tasted pretty good. I also got an everything bagel with cream cheese. I could tell the bagel is made fresh every morning - it was soft and airy. Would love to visit here again to try their B\u00e1nh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwich). \nAlso - loved how they drew a Penguin on my coffee!! So cute.",
  "I come here on the days I work remotely and they always make me feel right at home. They use some spicy honey Dijon like mayo on their Bahn mi tacos that\u2019s good enough to tan in, and you should always opt for one of the grab to go treats such as dark chocolate bars that they have at the counter. The owner is also very knowledgeable about his field at the business end of things, as well as being a sommelier of sorts for all things bean related :) you won\u2019t be disappointed by these folks",
  "Great coffees. On par with the best. The Chinese crepe that you see here is also very good.",
  "Cute place. Homey feel. Affable owner. Simple breakfast options. Minimal menu. Nice garden in the back.\nBest hot chocolate in Ridgewood",
  "Really amazing place! I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t have the highest expectations of this place when I first walked in. There\u2019s no real theme. But I\u2019m so happy I went!  \n\nAlthough their banh mi is not traditional, I do love their take on it!  I\u2019ve never had anything quite like it- awesome!  Their Chinese crepe was excellent and their chocolate drink- super unique and incredible! The perfect balance of flavors and just the right amount of sweetness! \n\nThe passion fruit slush was perfect-  plus the owner the owner was extremely friendly, and gave excellent recommendations.  Just a random place, but one I\u2019ll surely visit again!"

I\u2019m not sure if it was extra shrimp as well.in the small one it wasn\u2019t definitely! But of course they changed for extra! \nSo, as I said I don\u2019t eat spicy at all and I should ordered another food from another place not to be hungry.( it\u2019s extra money). \nVery upset that you don\u2019t care about your customers who pay you money!\nWhy I couldn\u2019t call and change? Because I took these food to my friends and just there figured out they gave me false order .",

I mentioned it to her she  brought the wrong ones, she said she could exchange them (but we already waited like 20 min for the food) so I said no.  She offer to give us a free soda for the mixup!\nThe place was not busy at all, there was 4 tables being waited on and the service was super slow.  They were concentrating more on their deliveries then the customers in their restaurant.   Food was ok.  The other Mexican restaurant down the street has better food.\nDo not recommend.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough.",
  "Ordered online and got 3 tacos, the steak, shrimp and chorizo, a flan and elote. Excellent service and super delicious food. Loved them all and the flan was to perfection. Very good flavors and the meats were well cooked.\n\nOne constructive criticism though: the elote needs a bit of help. I would like to see it with some grilled marks instead of boiled and more cheese sauce (it had very little). The flavor of the cheese coating was good though, so it\u2019s just the way the corncob is being cooked. \n\nWill be ordering again  soon \ud83d\ude0b."

It\u2019s always hit or miss depending on who\u2019s shift it is.\n\nWe go often and 2 of the 3 waitresses are stellar. Kind, inviting, and attentive. One though is cold and provides terrible service. Even if we are the only people she manages to be slow and rude. We\u2019ve had times that we simply ordered coffee and a simple dish and had to wait 20 minutes for the coffee and remind her, but we were the only ones! She brings the food and throws it down, no \u201cenjoy, anything you need?\u201d Or \u201chow is everything?\u201d \n\nShe has plenty of time to flirt with fellas at the counter every time we go though. Honestly will start avoiding the place when it\u2019s her shift.",

We\u2019ll definitely be back to try their dinner sometime.",

If you haven't visited yet, you should try them and you never know - you might find a favorite bagel sandwich.",

You really feel like family here. Be warned however the bagels are quite large, so come hungry!",

  "Great neighborhood bar and restaurant. Welcoming crowd, fun events and fantastic food. Wings are the best, especially on Wednesday Wing Night. Bartender Liz is the best! Great Happy Hour on Fridays.",
  "Delicious especially wing night!  and amazing service!!",
  "I have been there many times food is great. The only downfall is it takes a while for the food to come to your table.Average is about 30- 40 minutes. It's not the server's cuz you can get as many drinks as you want while you're waiting. Also had a great time at two comedy shows",
  "Dont bother ordering. Theyll accept your order. Cancel it after 10 min. Then tell you that they told seamless they had no delivery person 2 hours ago.\n\nOr like a previous time, accept your order and then call you 10 min later to tell you its after the cut off and all the delivery guys left for the night.",

  "This place is the one I like best. I visit plenty of restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The team is very receptive and the cuisine they offer is so flavorful. I am always happy to have a decent dinner in this place. Highly recommended.",
  "An old school diner with good food, reasonable prices and a friendly server, Gail. They messed up my takeout order slightly (asked for pita instead of a bun) but it wasn't a big deal. They messed up a second order when I was dining in. I'll give it another shot.",
  "Yoooooo! Their Penne Ala Vodka pasta is exquisite! Dont even get me started on those wings. Everything there was delicious. I loved it. No complaints.",
  "Have been going here since I was little! Four generations of mine have been going there for the delicious food and friendly people.",
  "The server was cordial .  Food was good the coffee way okay.  They have parking in the back of the resturant very small but it definitely a plus."

  "Thank you for staying open and especially thank you to all the workers helping out. Would it be possible though if they can wear masks and gloves while handling the food and orders? I went today and the person taking my credit card had nothing on and the person that gave me my food also had nothing on. They are kids so I understand they might not grasp the seriousness of what is going on, but can someone from upper management ask them to give the idea that they are taking precautions?",
  "It's so nice to find a McDonald's that still has a play place.  It's indoors and clean.  The entire restaurant is clean overall.  This will be our McDonald's destination even its further than the one by our home.",
  "Ok, second time I order. They short me on my order. You call McDonald's and whom ever answer's. Is extremely rude, tells you. Call grubhub and hangs up. So disrespectful, you pay good money between food and delivery. You think, maybe they would just listen. Help you out, avoid this place.",
  "You can't go wrong at McDonald's for breakfast.  I had a sausage egg Mcmuffin, a coffee and a hash brown. It was hot and tasted fresh...",
  "Quick service. Unlike other McDonald's they give you your order number and bring the food to you. They have a pretty decent sized seating area, playground and parking lot. They also have the all day breakfast option. "

  "This spot sure knows how to satisfy their clients. Regularly with a super friendly attitude. The food is affordably priced, regularly flavorful and clean.",
  "Just ordered for delivery. Not bad. Some cuts on the yellowtail were odd, but not bad. Miso soup tasted off. Taste was good overall. Never had soft shell crab before.",
  "I ordered delivery through Yelp, and it was fine. The food arrived within 45 minutes. Nothing unusual, but the food was cooked well. \n\nI had the sesame chicken, which for some reason was listed under \"Chef's Specialties.\" Sort of ordinary for a specialty, but it was good. \n\nThe spicy salmon roll was tasty. More salmon and less rice than is typical. There are sushi restaurants that have the same rolls, done as well or better, for less, but there weren't any issues here. \n\nThey have a large menu, which is usually a cause for concern, but in this case, it didn't cause any problems.",
  "Over an hour late. Told me it's because its December. Told me they just left. I'm 20 blocks away. 40 minutes later it's still now here. No good.",
  "What i love is that the chinese food here isn't as greasy has most other chinese food places, which is what actually reminded me to write this review. Would visit again if im ever back in the glendale area."

The dishes themself are extremely flavorful and cooked perfectly. \n\nWe just moved to the neighborhood and this will definitely be our go to spot for Chinese!",
