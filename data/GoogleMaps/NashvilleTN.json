   "Amazing place. Went for charity foundation concert. Atmosphere great and seats comfy. We were up in the balcony but view was good. All artists excellent and sound quality fab. Stayed locally enough to be able to walk. If you get the opportunity to go, take it and enjoy.",
   "Very nice! As someone not familiar with country music, the Opry, Nashville, or even the South in general (California-Colorado girl here), it was an absolute pleasure to learn and familiarize myself with such a rich history and culture! Definitely made our trip fabulous! (We did a backstage tour, as well as a Saturday live Opry show the day after.)",
   "We can mark this one off our bucket list! Opry is a must see! The tour lead our group to all the behind-the-scenes secrets. The wall of inductees, the dressing rooms, and we even got the option to have our photo taken on stage in 'the circle' that I've only heard about over the years growing up. What a wonderful experience, to be given the opportunity to relive and walk with country music!",
   "We did the backstage tour and loved it. I'm not even big country guy but I still found the tour very informative and engaging. Getting to go backstage at such a historic venue was very cool. If you can't see a show here, I highly recommend checking out the tour.",
   "An experience we will never forget! History was made by the Grand Ole Opry on the radio and on TV. We felt like we were a part of that history with the many talented musicians/bands that played. Saw about 10 or 11 acts, each playing two songs for about 2.5 hours total. Worth every penny!"

   "I loved this Zoo. I love that the animals were well taken care of and they were not on cement but in actual enclosures with grass and dirt. Place was so clean and every employee that we talked to there was very knowledgeable and answered our questions we had. I got to know the history behind the zoo and to find out that they are only using not even half of the hundred and eighty acres of land they have gives them even more space to grow. Would definitely love to come back if I'm ever in this area again",
   "This is a beautiful, clean and well maintain zoo. It has very attractive enclosures and great landscapes. It has a rope bridge over a river which is a lot of fun. They have areas for petting animals, including a kangaroo petting zone. A kangaroo petting area is something I hadn't seen before. It is a great place to take the kids or for adults that want to go for a walk and enjoy nature.",
   "The Zoo was amazing loved seeing all of the animals. Walking around \u201cPeru\u201d to see the Guinea pigs and the bear was an experience! Loved the atmosphere. They put so much time and detail in making the exhibits. Their gift shop is also full of cute knickknacks and souvenirs I couldn\u2019t pass it without buying something.",
   "Absolutely LOVE going to this zoo! We go often and still stay ALL DAY when we go! They have so many great programs *you can view a list online* and really good ADMITTING prices for this Mommy of 5! You can purchase year round passes or even donate to the Zoo online. The food is a little expensive there, but you are welcome to bring in your own ALSO with a hand stamp you can leave and come back anytime that day. Great staff! Very knowledgeable about the Zoo's history and the  animals! I Homeschool my children *so it's definitely a perfect learning experience for my little ones. Always enjoyable!",
   "I love zoos and this one was one to love. So many animals it was hard to get through all of it but we did it. There is an interesting inside exhibit with tons of wildlife. I like that many of the animals they had in captivity were endangered and the aim was to preserve the species. Kangaroo garden was my favorite part."

   "$6.00 is probably the cheapest (but awesome) experience in Nashville. It is the only one in the entire world that is fully restored and built in scale. The bottom entrance is where the gift shop and ticket sales are. If you are around downtown I would def recommend visiting it. Everyone is friendly and the guides are free. They also over tours at 2 PM.",
   "I was in the area with my best friend so we went to take a look.  Its existence is magnetic and filled me with curiosity. I could not help comparing to the original in Athens, so it\u2019s placement, so low to the ground, was very deflating. \n\nThe visitors, were mostly quite cheery, but I had a hard time calming my curiosity, to actually appreciate the structure. It was fun, it provided an activity, and something to do, nevertheless, the awe factor was missing. It appears small, yet it may have been be duplicated to scale? The Athena statue inside is painted and not beautiful. \n\nIt has great potential, and is certainly a note worthy undertaking, yet I did not sense an intended outcome. It felt very cement like and I kept thinking it would be a sweet,  Greek revival,  public  library. I really don\u2019t know what to say, really.\n\nI give this site a four stars because it provides a lovely activity in a lovely setting. Although, I personally struggle with understanding it\u2019s artistic place in the world, I do feel that it is a heartfelt offering that has provided a really wonderful place to visit.",
   "This is an awesomely large structure. We didn\u2019t do the tour, but walked around the outside. Very pretty walking path. The Athena may be only a statue to some but I can tell you, the spirit of a goddess most certainly dwells there. As I went before the goddess and bowed I was flooded with her presence to the point my face burned red hot and I was moved to tears. For a few moments I knew nothing else but that presence, everything around me simply melted away and I was wholly connected to the goddess. It is a once in a lifetime experience. I could not more highly recommend you visit. But come in reverence because you will be in the presence of a goddess. The history of the building and pictures of the original exhibition that this was built for was far more interesting than expected. There is also a small art gallery and the enormous statue of Athena to see as well as the building itself. It is worth a visit but not too much else round the area to see.",
   "I enjoyed the location. It was a very muggy day but seeing this monument/museum was pretty cool. I thoroughly enjoyed taking photos and video of the location there was a lot of construction going on so I was not able to get really good photos. The construction made it very muddy though so I\u2019m giving it three stars when I come back and everything is completed hopefully I can add the extra two stars.",
   "Was under construction when we visited but still very cool. If you are into Greek Mythology it is definitely worth paying the price to go inside the Parthenon. But also a great park to just walk around and enjoy the lake and flowers. Nice place to find in an Urban environment"

   "I understand why this is such an acclaimed spot for live music.  Besides the history (which alone is cool), every seat in the house is a good seat.  All seating are church pews and the entire venue is pretty small.  The acoustics are great and the music really does sound amazing no matter where you are listening.  The balcony is great to see a band and even if you're in the back you are still close enough to really see the action.",
   "If you love live music, you have to see a band here. Sound quality is close to perfect. Some seats have a pole in front of you. But that ends up being a non issue since you will probably be standing up anyways. Staff is courteous and helpful. Look for a band you like or even marginally like and see them here. You won't be disappointed.",
   "Beautiful historical Nashville landmark.  Venue allows for excellent views of performers from many seats.  Our favorite is balcony middle, at least 4 rows above edge of balcony, so please don't buy our seats \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 \n\nSeating is on wooden pews without cushions.  Inflatable cushions are prohibited. (There's no prohibition against coats.  A fiber filled coat folds into a nice cushion.)\n\nIf you have difficulty with stairs, there are seats at the top of the balcony.  Excellent provision for those in wheelchairs or assisted-walking devices.\n\nVenue staff are very helpful, so feel free to ask them your questions.\n\nSecurity screening is conducted BEFORE entering the venue.  ABSOLUTELY NO POCKET KNIVES of any size.  The staff prohibited a Victorinox Swiss Army Classic knife which has a tiny 32x6mm (1.25x0.25inch) blade, so leave ALL blades in your vehicle.",
   "Came here for the Josh Gates show. Our family all had a great time. The venue is small, so as long as your view is not obstructed by the pillars, your seat will be good. The bar inside is outrageously expensive, so if you want drinks I would highly recommend you go somewhere else before the show. Sound and lighting are always great. The ushers are super helpful and very nice.",
   "WONDERFUL place to see a show and the history there is unbelievable.  Our 2-year old son attended his first physical concert here (1st concert was when my wife was 2 months pregnant with him at the same location to see the same band!) and the staff was so sweet and kind to him.  We will make a trip here every time we're in the Nashville area.  Highly recommended!!!"

   "One of the must see destinations for visitors to Nashville but also a great weekend standby for locals. Gorgeous park, great space for walking with your dog or just relaxing on the lawns. Often times there are great food trucks, but it's also nearby a ton of excellent bars and restaurants. Start your weekend here and take your pick of where to go next. Having relocated out of Nashville, this is the place we miss the most. Visitors should your inside of the Parthenon at least once, but they do rotate the exhibits in the art gallery which rewards repeat visits.",

   "Loved visiting here. So much history, so much fun in one place. The staff are generally helpful. Many photo opportunities. Centennial Dog Park is right there in the same vicinity making bringing your furry friends easy. Enjoy your visit. . . We sure did!!",
   "The park has a beautiful lake that is home to ducks and Canadian geese. There are flower gardens & a neat stacked stone bridge that make great photo spots. The Parthenon is also here. It is a replica of the original & houses an art gallery & an impressive 41 foot gold gilded statue of the goddess Athena.",
   "Was under renovation last time we visited. Was breath takeing perfect place to being a date for a walk. Would be nice if the added areas to picnic and maybe a dog park. Nice reflection pond. It's in a good area. Traffic is kinda rough but the parking is very close."

Nice views of the city during the sunset, and the buildings at night. Also included information on the statues and displays around the campus.",
   "Far exceeded expectations!  It's flat out wonderful.  It's free with much to learn, much to see and much to do. It's very pretty and certainly as educational as u can get. It's a close walk to the state Capitol and close to downtown Nashville.  I'd go there again and again!",
   "This is a very interesting park with lots of historical appeal. I found the wall of TN events fascinating and the massive map of TN capture my attention for a considerable amount of it. It's also just a pretty area right in the heart of Nashville. I thoroughly enjoy it.",
   "I love this area because of the vast amount of things you can do. There's a food mall, marketplace, spots to picnic, and lots of space to walk, jog, or ride a bike. What makes it even better is that it's right next to the city area where it's a bit more busy.",
   "This park is a real treasure and unique in our state parks system.  I think every one of our large Tennessee cities need to plan for an urban state park such as this one.  I could tell this park is well used, well maintained,  and well appreciated by downtown workers and visitors to the city.   The farmer's market located adjacent to the park enhances the outdoor experience.   I bought fresh turnip greens and acorn squash--locally grown--and wish I had bought a basket of apples."

   "This museum is nothing short of amazing. It boasts America\u2019s most extensive collection of European vehicles, and that is evident. Housed in the former Sunbeam bread factory, the clean, open space is full of cars, scooters, bikes, and other assorted vehicles, including two cars propelled with airplane like propellers.\nI ran across this hidden gem while researching the Tatra car company of Czechoslovakia, and I was elated to see several beautifully restored specimens. The beauty and oddity did not stop there, though. Just observing the Ingenious approaches to locomotion filled one\u2019s imagination with the hours and energy invested into the unique designs.\nRex and Jessie were top notch guides. Their knowledge and enthusiasm made conversing about trends, engineering, and styling a true pleasure, and seeing all these magnificent examples tickled the imagination.\nI am blind and was loaned some cotton gloves, so I could caress the exhibits. Rex and Jessie took the time to make me feel like an honored guest and cheerfully pointed out the unique aspects to each of the vehicles we viewed.",
   "Fantastic treatment of these unique and important autos. These are loved and it shows. And the building! Fantastic. Excellent staff treatment and conversation. Made for an excellent destination with our Harley riding group. Worth the visit, and will be coming again for sure.",
   "I just spent 4 hours walking around nonstop. This place is fantastic! To my delight it had brilliant additions like bicycles, motorcycles, mini cars, airplanes, and so many items I've never heard of! If you have some time definitely do this one!",
   "Really enjoyed seeing rare cars, bikes and other vehicles and learning some cool facts as well. Fun for the entire family and a must see for any automotive enthusiast. (Sidenote: Was really impressed with how clean the bathrooms were!)",
   "I honestly don't even care about cars, but this place had me gawking at them for four hours. It was a huge surprise and a good one. Such an amazing collection of history, and vehicles of almost unbelievable design. It's also worth mentioning that there is a pretty cool mini museum of bicycles inside as well."

I've been to a few of their exhibitions now and I can say that it is worth going to because they are well coordinated and thoughtfully curated. They use the digital aids kinda sparsely; like the touch screens, but they do it to a point and its apparent when you experience it.",
   "We have enjoyed the Frist Art Museum several times and this visit was just as great. We loved the Eric Carle exhibit very much, along with the Native Indian Women art exhibit. The museum itself used to be the Nashville post office. We have enjoyed each exhibit we have encountered there. There is a pay-lot for parking. If you are traveling to Nashville be sure to make time for this museum.",
   "Excellent place for Children ages 2-5 maybe 6... I went during the Eric Carl exhibit which was geared towards kids to begin with. However that was not the best part. The activity center for kids was excellent. They had art activities, camera and motion stuff. My daughter had a blast and the staff was very friendly.  We will be returning. I will admit we have not attended during an exhibit geared towards adults but I look forward to doing so.",
   "This museum is AMAZING and the price is great. Kids 18 and under are free which is always great. College students are 10 dollars and free certain days. The museum offers rotating exhibits. This month was Eric Carle and it was cool. They also have a whole area where you can do arts and crafts and other activities. I will definitely be taking the kids back.",
   "Loved the Eric Carle exhibit! The Frist is open late on Thursday and Friday, so it's a great place to go after work and unwind. There were a few events there and lots of people - great vibrant atmosphere! The college student discount is an excellent deal too. Parking is $2/hr, thanks to the museum discount."

   "I actually signed up to be a member of Adventure Science Center last year, and will probably keep renewing indefinitely.  \n\nMy son has the best time running around and playing with their exhibits, be it the new features that change every few months or the static exhibits (some of which I played on when I was a kid, and don't worry they reflect current science, and I mean real science with evidence and whatnot). \n\nThere's a tower to climb with slides and neat interactive features, each of which constructed to impart some focused learning as the kids explore.  The planetarium has cool shows that also change regularly.  On that note, it's not all for kids.  There are monthly events after hours for adults, and laser shows set to various musoc features.",
   "Our family had a blast visiting this science museum! It seems like it's for kids on the younger side (similar to the children's museum we are used to in MN), but had things for all ages. Our 4-year-old had so much fun he didn't ever want to leave. We especially enjoyed the planetarium show in addition to the interactive exhibits",
   "The imagination runs wild for young and old alike. Wonderful, clean, friendly environment that ignites curiosity, creativity, and involves all senses. Fabulous place for kids and adults alike. Creative, interactive displays involve kids and inspire one to consider the inner workings of everything from the human body to sound and light waves to outer space. The planetarium is a favorite as well and with good reason. It's truly an educational and beautiful experience. Overall, and outing with o the Adventure Science Center provides education, fun and exercise for the whole family on a rainy day. Kids can run around the multilevel playground to burn off energy as well. In addition to all of this, there are spectacular views of downtown Nashville from the large, North facing windows. Highly recommended.",
   "Wonderful child-friendly museum with a great set of hands-on exhibits and displays that introduce kids to music, science & engineering, animals and the human body. Definitely one of the best places to take your children on a rainy day if you live in the greater Nashville area. Prices appear a bit steep at first glance but buying an annual membership is the way to go. Some of the stations or activities are a bit dated but the museum is undergoing a long-term renovation that\u2019ll only improve the experience for families.",
   "This place was so much fun. We took my three children (all under 10) and they had a blast. There was plenty to see, touch, and do. The place was clean and crazy busy. We went during the week and there were multiple school groups there. My only complaint was the school kids were pushy and at times obnoxious. The teachers with the groups didn't seem to mind or were over extended and couldn't pay attention. I was annoyed after the third child that was three times the size of my toddler took things out of her hands. It the facility could somehow help monitor the school groups it would be a five star \"adventure.\" We didn't try the cafeteria so I can't comment on that."

Great photo ops if you're actually looking for them.",

   "Super friendly rangers, neat to see electric charging spots offered, clean and interesting snippets of local wildlife inside - but get out on them trails, our large group loved the day and went around the lake. Really great place!",
   "Idyllic and easy to fit hikes into any schedule as long as parking cooperates. Made a full loop around the lake in an hour and a half (walking a leisurely pace).\n\nWatch out for wildlife-- beginning of February but we already saw a copperhead coiled up not a foot from the trail edge.",

The mansion had beautiful art galleries filled with gorgeous orchids throughout the place.  Must visit if you are ever passing the area. There is a gift shop and cute cafe with courtyard to sit outside and eat.  There is even areas in the botanical garden for children to enjoy. So whether it's date night or family time out, there's something to be enjoyed by everyone.",
   "The lights were very pretty for the holidays and well done. It is great that you also get access to the museum and art works with your ticket. I would definitely recommend this as well as the Nashville Zoo for things to do at night in the winter. It is great for a date night or a time out with family and friends. My favourite part were the lights over the ponds that reflected back. It takes about an hour and a half at least to walk through if you wanted to stop and see everything and even had deer for the holiday season.",
   "It is so beautiful & pleasant here! Great place to get a good walk in for exercise. We went on a Sunday morning & met Dr. Cindy for Tai Chi in the garden.

Various eateries to choose from, some offer live music ranging from folk to classical. It's a lovely place to visit!",
   "Christmas Tour:  Beautifully decorated estate and mansion.  Paved walking paths throughout the grounds.  Spectacular light display.  Takes a couple of hours to do the entire self tour.  Worth every penny!  Can't wait to go back in the Spring.",
   "The Christmas lights were wonderful!! And the fact they have the house open late to also tour it was great. Loved the history of the family & the grounds just as much as the festive decorations outside!! The train/toy room in the basement was definitely a favorite."

   "Hard to find parking and it wasn't cheap to park. Entrance to the museum was in a strange place. It was fairly pricey to get in, but if you are into the musicians side of music... it is a very enjoyable museum.  We spent 2 hours and weren't bored. People working there were very nice too.",
   "Country music is not my particular flavor of music but I enjoyed very much learning and appreciating this music.  This Country Music Hall of Fame is worth a visit.  Very fun museum. The hands on, interactive Grammy gallery was my favourite part! I didn't think I would spend nearly 3 hours here. Music lovers should come and jam.",
   "Pricey but so interesting and fun. My teenagers and I had a great time here. The interactive exhibits were amazing. We spent hours playing instruments, learning to drum with Ringo Starr, pretending we were in a recording studio and more. The Jimi Hendrix exhibit was my favorite.",
   "The exhibits ranged in quality a bit. Many of them were interactive, which was fun. Overall, I felt it was overpriced. This place would be best for very serious music lovers and for people who are primarily interested in older musicians. Very contemporary artists were represented only minimally. Street parking at a meter is $2.75ish per hour and this museum can be easily explored in it's entirety in less than two hours.",
   "Great place. Was uncertain whether this would be suitable for our kids or not (11, 9, 7 years) but they loved it even more than my wife and I did. Great place with a whole lot to do for the entire family. Lots of interactive stuff where you can test your vocals (karaoke and recording studio) and dj skills. Also pretty good selection of articles from numerous artists. Highly recommended!!"

I\u2019ve had friends get engaged on the bridge and usually there are some folks playing music that lends to a fun atmosphere. Overall a great little piece of Nashville. There\u2019s also good places to park near the bridge and Nissan stadium as long as there isn\u2019t an event, as always though pay attention to signage to avoid trouble.",
   "A fantastic view of downtown Nashville!   EPIC sunsets!   And the perfect place to spend on a date with your special someone.    \nEvery time we visit Nashville, walking the bridge is on our bucket list.   There are always lots of people and plenty to see.  \nIf you're visiting Nashville, this is absolutely a great spot!  \nPerfect for couples getting engaged or just wanting romance for the evening.",
   "It's a nice place to spend the afternoon, but they could just keep it clean it would be better. When you walk you can smell urine. It was kinda shady too but the city view was nice.",
   "One of the best views in Nashville aside from the roof top bars! It's a great place to walk and look down the river and see the city. It does have a fairly steep incline going up the bridge, so I advise those that are handicapped to use the elevator if possible. It is a very hot spot for tourists to take photos. The views are just amazing!",
   "Wish I would have known about the parking lot before emptying my wallet at other parking lots. Parked there twice now, once during the day and once at night and as far as I can tell, you don\u2019t pay to park there. It\u2019s a 5-10 min walk to broadway from there. At nights it\u2019s an excellent view"

It is the perfect orientation to the music you will hear during the evening, especially if you enjoy an occasional evening of classical music but aren't an expert. So much talent! Highly recommended.",

The Getty concert was absolutely wonderful. We plan to return next year.\nAlso, the parking was really close and protected. Great experience!",
   "Beautiful! The venue felt a little bit like a Jane Austin era building with 1920s amazing lamps and velvety chairs. They were narrow on my well endowed hips, but many people left at intermission so there was plenty of room. We were on the back row of the highest balcony and it felt closer to the stage than the closest balcony at the Atlanta symphony. Each level had its own parlor for intermission with wine, water and soda available. I did not order any wine because it was 12 dollars for a glass. But my friend did and said the red was very good.",
   "I just went and saw Star Wars: Return of the Jedi with the Nashville Symphony playing the soundtrack. It was great! Even though the orchestra was right in front of me, I would forget they were there. The music was perfectly in sync with the movie. It was a really cool experience!\n\nAnd a note on the Schermerhorn: it is an absolutely beautiful building!",

Maybe offer a microphone with your favorite singer embedded or something?  The shop is a bit small with not too much to offer.",
   "Very fun place, free parking and all the options to eat. The museum with all of the wax figures is awesome, whit a lot of music, and if you go to the museum in important dates probably the figures changes its clothes. You can also take photos with the figures and clothes, touch it and make fun photos and selfies with your favorites singers. The wax figures aren't only of country singers, they also have pop and rock famous artist. This experience is one of the best being in Nashville",

   "If you have thoughts of where a lot of the great music from country to rock n roll was recorded, well it's a must see. From the hotspot- where they would stand and sing to the actual piano where all the greats played (ELVIS and so on) which is still been used today. Wow!",
   "I was an inspiring recording engineer back in the 70's, it was nice to visit one of the famous recording studios.  Only 4 stars as there was too much emphasis on Elvis. Also, we were told about taking a photo of a blue star.  No one in our group saw it and nobody knew why it was important.",
   "I can\u2019t recommend this tour enough. Our guide was amazing. Probably the best guide I\u2019ve ever had at any place of interest. \nThis place has so much amazing history. If only walls could talk. It\u2019s never a boring tour. \nMy wife really isn\u2019t in to any of the music produced here but she loved it. \nIncredibly interesting. You learn so much.",

And I still enjoyed myself a lot.\nThat guy was a genius.",

   "This museum has a few interesting pieces and memorabilia. They do a pretty good job of displaying everything and giving a good view of it all. The museum itself is fairly small and, in all, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a whole lot there. It may be nice just to see the specific pieces they have that others don\u2019t.",

He was way ahead of the idea of prison reform. And a great support of American Indian rights totally worth it and the tick was fairly priced"

My wife and I enjoyed a chance to hear about the history of the distillery and family as well as get a chance to step out on the production floor and into the barrel house. As a big bourbon fan, I found it interesting to learn about the differences between Tennessee whiskey and bourbon. The tour also included a tasting of the Tennessee whiskey (which I thought was an excellent product so I even bought a bottle), a few Belle Meade bourbons, and a liquor. Great stop if you're in Nashville and want to experience a distillery without leaving town!",

If you are shy, this might not be the thing for you. Come in cool clothing as the rooms can be somewhat confined.",

You better believe we\u2019ll be coming back here the second they open a new room.",
   "We did the ruins, mars, and heist rooms all within 24 hours. After booking our first one the other two were 20% off and they even closed out the rooms for us. We were late to our last one because a party member had gotten sick and they even let us use the full time and were willing to refund the sick player. The games themselves had puzzle types that matched the themes of the rooms and each hint-giver we had would point us in the right direction if we were having issues with a puzzle. Very fun and friendly. High quality and unique story-based puzzles."

I\u2019ve often had to \u2018cheat\u2019 to figure out how to use the clues I was given. \n  My group did have trouble with some locks that didn\u2019t work smoothly.

And we were able to use them to figure out that we had correctly solved a puzzle but had to work the locks more. \n   The puzzles and challenges were satisfying. They weren\u2019t cheap. And there were a number of surprises along the way. Definitely worth it. Great group activity. \n  I will be going back to run the other options. Just awesome.",

The staff were incredible and we were made to feel very welcome. In over 300 escape rooms that we have done around the world, Gold Rush is up there with my favourites. Can not recommend this very professional company enough. Jacob, Libby and Kim took such good care of us. We are heading to the Berry Hill location tomorrow to continue the fun!"

   "The Escape Game at Opry was so much fun that I forgot we were inside a mall! The clues were so unique and clever and kept us on our toes.  Better than any other escape room companies I\u2019ve seen.  Will definitely book again!",
   "We had a group of 5 adults and an infant. Our guide was Anthony. This was a first escape room experience for all of us. We did the Gold Rush one. It was soo fun! We finished with 17 seconds left! It was challenging and thrilling! I definitely recommend this escape room and location. The staff was friendly and encouraging and it was so much fun! Will do more of these in the future.",
   "I came on my birthday and did the Special Ops room with some friends- it was SO MUCH FUN! Courtney S. was our game guide and made the experience that much more \u201cSpecial\u201d! I\u2019ve also been through the Gold Rush room and that room was also a lot of fun. 10/10 would recommend (or I guess 5 stars....)!",

   "We are from Indiana. We were visiting Nashville. When we stayed at Gaylord Operland hotel but parked for 6 hours in one of your parking areas onAugust 15, 2019. We had dinner and went to a concert at the Bridgestone arena. We had 2 separate charges one for $30 and one for $45 same night. ..a total charge of $75 for 6 hrs of parking. I contacted you about this situation and asked if one charge the lesser could be refunded since we were charged twice for the same time and same parking lot. You said you couldn't do it but would give us a certain percent off on the next time we parked there. Again being out of town this is not an option since we do not use this parking.

   "This is the best place for a short weekend mini vacation. People from all over come here,  especially bachelorettes/ bachelor.   There is no better party place than here. Even people from Vegas come here to party. If you're not into drinking and clubs, TN is a huge state that has lots beautiful scenery that can be seen at Chattanooga or pigeon forge at the smoky mountains. There are tons of shopping malls and outlet stores, and of course a vast variety of food. Can't leave TN before you try out the barbecue!"

We also did a mansion tour which Sarah did a great job explaining the history of the plantation. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and everyone was very friendly. I would definitely come back to see more.",
   "Had a great time. We went as a large group of 14 and did the tour which was awesome and super informative then got explore the grounds a bit. At the end we did the wine tasting and bought wine and other fun stuff to take home. I have recommended this place to anyone thinking about taking a trip to Nashville. It's a nice change of pace from the night life there.",
   "Will always remain one of my favorite places. I went here the first time as a girl for a school field trip and absolutely fell in love with the entire place. It is definitely a good place to go to learn a little about Tennessee's history and to connect with the past. I believe my favorite little bitty about this place is the playhouse. It always fascinated me that its the same one the girls played in when they were little. Silly but its one of my favorite things about the place. The grounds are kept beautifully and the way the rooms are displayed is lovely and accurate. Lets not forget about that main stair case! It is absolutely beautiful.  Always feel like royalty when im on it. Love this place and love the way its represented. A gem you must see.",
   "We visited Belle Meade with a group of 14... booking was simple, and after one cancellation they were very understanding and were able to refund the ticket. I have been to the Hermitage, so I was interested to see how this would compare. The grounds were smaller, but the decorations stayed true to the time period, and as we were told, many were original. Our tour guide was able to answer all our questions and provided excellent information. The weather was chilly and rainy but didn't have a negative impact on our tour. The wine tasting at the end was a great addition to the afternoon, and I must note the gift shop was one of the better ones I've seen, and if I didn't have a carry on suitcase I would've purchased at least a bottle of wine and six souvenirs. Highly recommend!",
   "My husband and I are in no way horse racing enthusiasts but we both found our visit to Belle Meade Plantation completely fascinating. It is a lovely property, steeped in interesting history. After our tour we had a delicious lunch at the on-site restaurant.  We only had time to visit one historic property on our trip and were not disappointed at all with our choice of Belle Meade."

   "So we did the Christmas Show in December of 2019.  Overall, the show was good, and the food was good, and it was definitely something a little different than the usual dinner and a show kind of evening.  The view of Nashville along the river on deck is quite beautiful. \n\nNow for the parts that I did not enjoy. The line to get in seemed to take a long time.  The wait at each of the bars to get drinks also took what seemed like excessive amounts of time.   The buffet line was also quite long.  Most of the waiting at the dinner table was ok because we had pretty good company...BUT that was by luck.  \n\nMy wife booked the evening for just the two of us, and it was not clear that we would be seated at a table of 10 with strangers.  Now it just so happened that we all got along after the initial period of uncomfortable silence, and I think we all wound up enjoying each others company, but I have to say that was pure luck. \n\nI would have rated this review a 4 or 5 stars if my wife and I had been seated alone.",
   "I like it... My wife and I enjoyed it we went for the Christmas special and it was great. They show fan appreciation for a young woman who always visit every year. However it might be very loud at something during the concert performance bring headphones if you are with someone who might need it. The view for outside was great and the ride was smooth.",
   "I will tell you that you better get ready for a show to knock your boots off. Service staff is very good and highly effective. Getting to watch the skyline of downtown come into view was breathtaking. Then the entertainment that was provided is great. Don't let me waste anymore of your time now.

Especially upstairs, visualizing all the visiting children running back and forth in the upper hall separating bedrooms. You know they had to get a peak downstairs at evening guests and during parties. Not for children or teens unless they are known to be mature and have a specific interest in American History.",
   "Wow. Such rich history here, some of which is heartbreaking. The grounds are gorgeous and very well-kept, and the tourguides (dressed to play the part) did great at bringing the past to the present and making us feel as though we had traveled back in time. I felt as though we had been transported to another world. A very eye-opening and visceral experience, and a trip to Nashville wouldn't be complete without stopping here. You won't regret immersing yourself in such a vital part of our country's history--the horrible aspects and all.",
   "Highly recommend this trip into our Historic past. From the first moment we drove onto the property until reluctantly leaving I was enthralled with the Hermitage. I went through the museum, the tour, then walked the paths reading about the history of the place. Very worthwhile!!",
   "American history at it's best.  The dual drama is well done.  The mansion is worth the wait in line.  We spent 3:15 and I wish I had about 45 minutes more really finish a walk of the grounds.  We spent about an hour in line to tour the mansion - we went on a Saturday at 1:00 in December.  If you go at a none busy time, if there is such a thing, maybe you could do it 3:00 hours.",
   "Love for what ever reason learning history about our past presidents and the how the period compares to the present period.  Seems like every era has its challenges.  Nice exhibits and an educational movie about A. Jackson's contributions to US History.   It was nice to learn he was the only President to pay down the the national debt to zero.  No other president can claim that award.  The guided tour of the actual house was excellent.  Jack our tour guide was very good at providing more history of the house, its contents and Andrew Jackson himself.  Lunch at the Kitchen Cafe was good as well.  Everyone we interacted with both at the cafe and the property were pleasant and helpful."

First half of the tour is in the printing room, second half is in a classroom/work room. You do get to complete a print to take home (the print is nothing special, but still a cool experience). \n\nYou get a 10% discount at the shop after your tour (don't forget to ask for the discount).",
   "We visited TN from FL and this was the only event I chose to book in advance. We bought tickets to the \"Block Party\" (which lands on the first Saturday of each month during the art crawl). This was really one of the highlights of my trip. We had a little mini history lesson (I could've sat and listened even longer if they let me) before getting to it. The options felt endless, however, we would have really benefited by extending the time at LEAST one more hour. I went home with a couple incomplete projects, but it was still such a fun experience. My husband enjoyed it greatly, as well, and we have since framed our prints. I've told everyone about the prints and the history behind the Hatch Show. I do wish we got a tour with our tickets, even as a voucher to use the following day, as I assumed I'd get to see the old equipment but didn't get to (so make sure to purchase them separately if you want to see that). However, this doesn't take away from the experience as its own entity. I'd even consider paying for smaller group or personal sessions to get to use some type blocks. Thanks for the memory, guys!",

   "Beautiful park. Lots to do for all ages. The Parthenon was absolutely beautiful. And the paintings they had inside are amazing. Definitely worth the trip. And priced at $6 admission",
   "The dog park was awesome!! They were running around everywhere, but of course controlled. If you are there then pay the $6 to go into the Parthenon. It  is probably the cheapest (but awesome) experience in Nashville. It is the only one in the entire world that is fully restored and built in scale. The bottom entrance is where holly he gift shop and ticket sales are. If you are around downtown I would def recommend visiting it. Everyone is friendly and the guides are free. They also over tours at 2 PM. Hope you enjoy the pics. This, the park, and the Parthenon are all very close together.",
   "Very clean very nice and there's plenty of nice people to talk to! I love the fact they even have people who provide very good and helpful articles from the Bible. It makes you feel safe.",
   "Great ! Historical. Close to farmers market  and state capitol. Pretty, loaded with trees, monuments and a great amphitheater.   A very pleasant surprise!  Free!\nEasy to get free parking.",
   "Lovely dog park, varied terrain, plenty of benches, and a walking path throughout.  Overall very impressed with the condition, park is well cared for.  Within walking distance to Centennial Park (about 5 mins on foot/paws).  Separate area for smaller dogs.  People were all super friendly, and dogs were all well maintained/picked up after!"

   "I posted pics of the kids course and the adult course. Our family of seven went zip lining here on vacation and we all loved it. Our seven and nine year old did the kids course, and the guide was nice enough to accompany our seven year old on the course. Our grandparents took pictures from the ground. My other sons ( ages 12 and 14) and mother and uncle (both in their 50s) enjoyed the adult course. The two older adults got off at the half way point for a drink and then continued and finished the entire course. We were there for hours and to top it off, we ended the day by all going on their huge zip line course which was separate from the other courses. It was such a huge zip line that the other side was barely visible. This was worth the money and was fun for the whole family."

If you're visiting for the (excellent) view of the Nashville skyline, take the left part of the loop and the trail up to the top of the hill. There are several wooden outlooks built at the top of the fort and with a few shade trees there as well.",
   "Great program presented by  AAHGS of Nashville. Runaways, Coffees and Fancy Girls featuring Bill Gary (book by the same title). Visitors' Centering was easy to locate (Near Adventure Science Center). Nice walking trail that leads to historical markings about the park. After walking the trails, I decided to become a friend and hopefully get involved in the restoration project. I encourage others living in Nashville or visitors to the area take some time to drop in. They also have a staff member on the property to answer questions and programs.",
   "This park is cool and historic, has really cool views of the city. I really enjoyed coming here. I was pretty disappointed though when we arrived and the park was in some significant disrepair. Some of the decking was in really bad shape, and because of that some of the paths and viewing spots were closed off to visitors. Which could totally defeat the reason for coming to the park in the first place. I hope that can be fixed soon.",
   "Cool place but not much to see. Alot of area was blocked off. Rich with history. Great view of the city though.",
   "Really cool and historical civil war era fort. Unlike many other civil war sites in Nashville, this one has it's own modern visitors center, complete with a small theater, gift shop, and exhibits. The fort itself has a well maintained trail around and inside of it. There is plenty of historical signage and information along the way. The views of downtown and surrounding Nashville are the best you'll find anywhere, especially on the north side of the fort. Such a cool site, and as the largest inland fort built in the civil war I am especially glad it has been preserved and can be visited today. This is a great place to bring kids, or history buffs. Also is a must see on the Battle of Nashville driving tour."

   "Breathtaking view. When you take gps here it takes you to a neighborhood, make sure you park across at the Two Rivers Park and walk under freeway to get here. Its about 1 mile, .5 here and .5 back. Worth the view.",
   "Great place for a hike, recommended for all ages, bring your bike and helmet, if you are hiking bring a hat and water as it gets hot and humid on summer.",
   "Pretty cool place to check out and great view of downtown fireworks.",
   "it was hard to get here from my hotel however it seems like it's a very nice park.I was only able to see part of it because one of the bridges is closed.",
   "Very nice and beautiful ride watching the General Jackson roll under us. Be prepared for the ride back up over the bridge."

   "The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, is one of the world's largest museums and research centers dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of American vernacular music.\n\nThis was a very pleasing visit into the past of our country music. I think any trip to Nashville to explore the roots of country music could not be called complete without a visit to this wonderful museum. \n\nWe really liked this museum. The audio option provides good explanation of exhibits. Provides great overview of country music history. We enjoyed seeing Elvis's \"gold\" car and piano.\n\nWell worth the money.",
   "Super cool place, but you need alot of time to really see everything.\nWe were there just for a couple hours before closing, and couldn't get to see the top floor of exhibits in time. They have several interactive exhibits throughout that were pretty fun, like making your own music recording and CD cover art :)\nWe probably took over 100 photos and weren't even able to get to all the areas. Can't wait to go back one day",
   "One of the main attractions of Nashville and it does not disappoint. There is something for everyone to admire and learn about. My most surprising was Willie Nelson. I got such a kick out of the elaborately embellished suits that the men performed in and such bright colors which I found ironic because we had black and white TVs but it wasn't for us as home...it was for their audience. There is so much more to enjoy here.",
   "What a great way to spend several hours. A whole day could be spent there if you were really into country music. Took my teenage children and they enjoyed the new were displays, however they did enjoy looking at the history of country music. Not only the music, but the cars, instruments and clothing that the artists were during that time. We are intriguing.",
   "Certainly the best place in the world to experience the history of country music, and even if you are not a country music fan, it's worth a visit. You'll see hundreds of historic instruments - the ones played by the legends - as well as costumes, personal belongings, and other memorabilia. Beautiful building and conveniently located in the heart of the downtown entertainment district."

You can finish or start your ride on the pedestrian trail and rent a bike at the nature park to ride to the Cumberland pedestrian bridge. Nice green and plush with flora and fauna...I saw rabbits and a family of deer on my bike ride.",
   "Wow!  Super happy to have found this great park!  Great opportunities for hiking and biking. They even have rental bikes so if you are from out of town you can still enjoy a ride.  It\u2019s was really pretty and very spacious, plenty of parking, etc.  get out and stay active while you are on vacation!  Super easy to do it in a place like this!",
   "Nice quiet place in the midst of the hustle bustle of the city. Beautiful views. Walk. Run. Rent a bike. Catch a ballgame (summer) the pond is gorgeous. The river is breathtaking. The nature center is beautiful but I\u2019ve not been inside. The added hands on park for the kids is something I wish were there when mine were smaller. \nIt\u2019s worth the stop. Bring a picnic. It\u2019s Nashville at its finest. Plenty of parking.",
   "Great location for photoshoots. This park is an awesome place to get out of the city of Nashville while still basically being in the city.   Some of the trails feel pretty remote.  My friends and I love hiking out there."

Looking forward to next year! \n\nThe church is so rich in history and the Egyptian Revival architecture is fascinating.  A great church to visit on Sunday or during the Nashville art crawls.",
   "An excellent example of the early architecture of Nashville. I was once given a guided tour by a good friend who worked there. They were very detailed in the explanation of the construction and even more detailed when describing the the future plans for the management of the beautiful and well maintained old structure. And of course there were the other stories\n... Actual local truths that had occurred and in some way or another had an impact on the church... Or those almost a little too far fetched and possibly a tad bit frightening at the same time, ones that you sincerely hope are entirely fictional, but know full well in the back of your mind that there is a little bit of truth in every story \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude33\n\nOf course i don't recall any of it really it was an awful long time ago... And i was a lot younger and maybe didn't pay as much attention as i should have to the truely beautiful and interesting things in life like the history behind the Downtown Presbyterian Church. \n\nSo go see some of the old architecture when you're here. They're like a well-kept local secret hidden in plain sight. And please people we've already convinced the poor tourists that peddle taverns are a good \ud83d\udca1 idea, do we have to have a Party \ud83c\udf89 Fire \ud83d\udd25 Truck \ud83d\ude9a?

   "Absolutely incredible experience! If you\u2019re looking for a fun time, this is it! Celebrated my best friends birthday and rang in the new year Off the Wagon! We even ended up extended our tour because we were having so much fun! Ivey is amazing and great DJ listens to all your requests. 10/10 recommend and absolutely would do this again next time I\u2019m visiting!",
   "We had a bachelorette weekend for my best friend a few weekends ago and we reserved this Tractor Tour and boy are we glad we did! This was such a fun experience and made our first day in Nashville a day to remember! Shout out to Ivy! She's the best bartender/DJ/photographer ever!!",
   "Off the Wagon Tractor Tour was fantastic!  We had a party of 9 people, was  a perfect way to cruise around the city, drink beer, and listen to great music.  Cory and Ivy were awesome!  Would highly recommend!",
   "We used \"Off the Wagon\" Tours for our friend's bachelorette party, and although I don't have photos, I can say in confidence that they showed us a great time! We could drink and get a tour of the best areas of Nashville. We played music, danced, sang, and had such a fun time. We will be back to use them again if we come into town."

I can't say enough good things, and I hope we get to do this again some time! In the meantime, sharing our wonderful at the Nashville airport with anyone who would listen will have to do! Great job guys, our group of four thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!",

We had an amazing time touring the city, playing our favorite beats and drinking our favorite drinks. Maggie made our music wishes happen, and made sure that our cups were never empty! Would highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for a great time, and I will definitely repeat this if I find myself in Nashville again!",

They seem to have great chemistry and it looked like they are having almost as much fun as we were. While the reviews seem to indicate they are like this with every tour, they made us feel like we were the best group they had ever had! So much fun and I would go again in a heartbeat next time we're in Nashville!",
   "DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! \nSo unprofessional and rude! \nWe had a reservation for a tour this past weekend, and we got a phone call three hours prior saying they had to cancel due to \"mechanical issues\" with their bike and they did not have a backup. However, then we saw the SAME bike we were supposed to be on out on Broadway at our scheduled time. When the lady called me to cancel she was SO rude and unapologetic about the entire process. She did not once offer a discount for a different time or day. If you don't want your Music city plans ruined, then  DO NOT use this company!!!!\n\nTo your response: You gave me an option for a party bus with no discount, AT ALL. I was never once rude or did not hang up on you. I asked you multiple times if there was any other time to reschedule to and you made it very clear there was not and there was nothing you could do other than a refund. I am sorry that you are upset for the terrible review, but giving a rude reply is also not the answer. If your customer service was better then this review would have been different."

We would definitely return if desiring a wonderful meal in this quieter / refined atmosphere.",

Not expected, but appreciated. We knew that we would have to wait, that would have been fine. The server did  a fine job with the menu review and keeping us \"topped off\" and tending to any needs. The food was excellent from the starters to the dessert. No complaints at all. Very good. However, and this is on me for not checking the bill closely enough at the end of the meal. There were a couple items added on to my bill that I know we did not order...one of which was a cappuccino. (Neither my wife or I drink coffee). So there was an additional $15 dollars place on my bill that is unaccounted for.  We would go back, just will know to check the bill a little more closely.",

We loved this hotel the best out of 3 we stayed in on a 5 day trip around Tennessee. My daughter said that was the best biscuits and gravy we had on our trip - and I really enjoyed my two scrambled eggs, toast and potatoes plus a side of bacon that Matteo said was from a local farm nearby. I am so mad we didn't go into the restaurant at this hotel sooner!",
   "Food was amazing,  staff was friendly and welcoming our server was Breck she was so sweet. The omelet was filled with delicious spinach and goat cheese, potatoes were delicious. My husband avocado toast he said it was the best he has had! The bacon is local and so thick and flavorful. Definitely a hidden gem.  The only reason I would not give a 5 star is the coffee is not that great it definitely does not match the quality of food.",
   "Stopped by this restaurant because it was a convenient walk around the corner from our hotel. Making this a MUST whenever we're in town! We had the restaurant to ourselves and go to talk one-on-one with our server, Ricky, and manager, Chanel. They were amazing people to get to know! I can't stress how amazing the service was. I'd come back just to say hi to them. The food to die for \u2014 gave you that comfort food style of the south mixed with an elegant flair! Can't recommend this place enough!",

The restaurant was already full and bustling with activity by 630. The interior is well decorated, clean and cozy.  We ordered wine and cocktails the server and service was quick and responsive.  For appetizers we ordered the bone marrow, pate, scallops and mussels. Wow! each app was like a favorite to different folks around out table. All were delicious and a couple could easily substitute for and entree! For entrees everyone but one got the ny strip the chef\u2019s specialty. We split the steak and it was plenty for two. Our other party had the duck breast and it was fabulous too.  I believe our servers name was Kelsy. She did a fantastic job serving a five top of foodies!! \nWe\u2019ll definitely be going back!\n\nUrban Cowgill \nDecember 2019"

   "Husk restaurant was amazing. The old house is a perfect spot for a restaurant, so beautiful. Atmosphere was so nice. Location was perfect from our hotel, only a 10 min walk. Food was fantastic. The Shrimp and Grits was to die for. One of the best things I\u2019ve ever eaten. Our server, Logan, was very professional, polite and attentive. We live in Canada, so it may be a while before we return, but if I lived in Nashville, I\u2019d visit this restaurant regularly.",
   "I have been to Husk Nashville a few times, but have also been to the Husk in Charleston. For loving Charleston's food scene so much, I can honestly say I like Husk Nashville more. The building itself makes the dining experience a little different than a normal restaurant, which I personally find very nice. The happy hour is great. You have to sit at the bar, but it's a cool space. The burger is one of the best burgers I've had. Cooked perfectly, with all the right toppings. I have also formally dined here a few times. The menu is constantly changing, with options for everyone. There's usually a vegetarian option too, which is helpful. If you're looking for a special occasion meal, or just to try something new, I definitely recommend trying Husk.",
   "Absolutely incredible! Everything from the service, to the atmosphere, to the food was downright perfect! The dishes were all elevated comfort foods with a signature twist, and my mouth is watering again just thinking about them. The bar area is cozy, and the cocktails were creative and went down easy!! Even the restrooms were spotless! 5 stars all around!",
   "Located in a gorgeous old mansion where there are essentially three rooms: what might have been a small parlor immediately to the left of the front door contained just five tables, a larger room on the other side (kitchen's in back) and a large area downstairs. Best I could tell on my trip to the WC (downstairs), all the tables are four-tops but for two narrow two-tops in the dimly lit parlor area already described.",
   "Subtle and delicious flavors. Creative chef. Parker House rolls are to die for. Very satisfying yet we weren't overly full after. The best meal I've had in a long time."

   "We made reservations to eat here for New Year's Eve. It was packed! Great restaurant with such a cool ambiance. The bar area has a piano on it with a live band. The service was friendly and quick. The food was simply delicious!! Prices were fair and portions were plenty. The Godfather roll was one of my favorite appetizers. The mashed potatoes and mac & cheese were great table sides. The surf & turf was the best part! We will be back.",
   "I have been to a lot of steakhouses in my time but by far I really enjoyed the steaks at Jeff Ruby's. It was well-cooked it was good quality meat and it was very seasoned well the food is was prepared exactly the way that I liked it. We had a 36 ounces ribeye together and appetizers we had main course we had drinks and we had dessert for a couple of 2 under $150. It was my birthday thank you Jeff Ruby's.",
   "Loved everything from the first step through the door to the last crumb on my plate.  They have a fabulous truffle butter and bread to start which is to die for!  The sushi is super fresh and smaller so it's easier to take in 1 bite.  Great wine list to accompany any meal which was nice.  I got the lemon chicken which was perfectly cooked and moist.  I left super full and had amazing service.",
   "Tremendous experience. Food, atmosphere, drinks, and staff were all top-notch. The raw bar was excellent as well. If you go to Nashville and don't eat here you are messing up.",
   "This is a beautiful restaurant!!  Very upscale and the service was great.  We had the seafood tower and the petite surf and turf.  Both amazing meals, however, the best part was the dessert.  If you go to this restaurant you'll have to try the powdered donut holes with incredible dipping sauces.  Nothing short of amazing!!!"

   "Good Italian restaurant. I have been here a few times and the food has been good. (The reason I keep gong back). I would recommend signing up for their email and you get periodically an email offering $10 off $30 or $20 off $50 so grab a friend and go. They have good lunch specials-complete meal for $10.50 and of course the buy one and take one classical pastas. What I like about that is the pastas that you take are not heated so they are not dried from overheating when you get home. For me, I can easily split a pasta dish and be filled.",
   "Wonderful experience in Nashville. Excellent option if you are staying in one of the nearby hotels. Our server was named Samantha and she had the sweetest demeanor. She was respectful and observant to our cues. On some of the pasta dishes, they send you home with another dish, compliments of the chef. Overall very happy with the experience."

   "This is a great place for people who love to eat. Chicken, lamb, and many different cuts of steak are just some of the different meats that they offer. They also have many sides, gourmet salads and a desert bar! Come hungry because it is an \"all you can eat\" experience. Fabulous food and excellent service from Lamon!!! He was super attentive to all of our needs! You won't be disappointed!",
   "I have eaten at numerous Brazilian grills but I have to say that this one was disappointing. It started when we walked in and we could see many open tables but it seemed like a challenge for the hostess to find us one. It went downhill from there. We were finally seated and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally we were greeted by a staff member that asked us if our waitress had been over to take our order. She was very apologetic and got us drinks and explained the process of the red and green notifier. We went to the salad bar. It had a pretty good selection and everything there was great. Back to the table and we were asked again by the same young lady if our waitress had come to introduce herself. Again we said no. She apologized again and refilled our drinks for us. Unfortunately that was the last time we saw any waitress. The meat selections were pretty good, but considering the cost we were disappointed with the quality compared to other Brazilian steakhouses we have eaten at. I had to go to the waitress station to get my check and pay it as we were tired of waiting. Overall a disappointing experience. Fortunately this was the first disappointing experience we have had dining in Nashville this week.",
   "An out of town experience for me, I'm from Portland, Oregon. We have a place just like this in Portland, and the food here is better. All the meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned with perfection. A great all-you-can-eat menu for sure. \n\nI only took off 1 star because the service, while fast and accurate, was pushy. We had less than 30 seconds with the drink menu before she asked us what we wanted. When we said we needed more time, she was back in about 1 minute. With 5 people sharing one drink menu that doesn't work. \n\nAlso, the server was poking fun at us for not eating as much as she thought we should have. I'm sure it was meant to be friendly, but it didn't really come across that way.",
   "Great place for a special occasion or a group of friends! I dined for brunch and it was amazing. Endless meat choices carved at your table! A great selection at the salad bar as well!!! Also breakfast favorites at the breakfast bar! All for around 27$. Great location! Perfect place to leave full and walk it off downtown...",
   "Definitely one of the better restaurants downtown. I love that they have valet parking. The place gets a little busy due to it being in an area where a lot of tourist frequent but if you make a reservation, you shouldn't have a problem getting a table. I love the whole concept of the service. It's like a fancy buffet with servers bringing different types of meat and seafood until you say, I quit with your little green and red block. Definitely a favorite of mines in Nashville."

   "We traveled to Nashville to celebrate a birthday, so I was looking for a place that could accommodate a party of 14, wasn't super pricey, and of course, had amazing food. For such a large party the service was prompt and accommodating. The mason jar cocktails were delicious, my favorite being the Stillery Sour, and the Blackberry Lime was popular around the table as well. Three of us ordered the Hot Chicken Mac n Cheese, and honestly we could've all split it...delicious but very filling, and lived up to the hype. I can't handle spicy food so I ordered the mildest option, but it was still too hot for me. The wings were very spicy as well, but the catfish was tasty. Since we were upstairs, live music began during our dinner...very interesting type of music on a Thursday night. Overall, it was a great choice, everyone enjoyed the food & drinks, and the service was excellent. Recommend!",
   "Love the drinks options and the hot chicken pizza. The Mac & cheese is a must have but share with the group since you get plenty! There are two floors and both have live music. It's a great way to enjoy the Music City Vibe and try some different food. Great place for locals and tourists.",
   "Great food, good drinks, friendly staff. All the components for a memorable experience. Our server recommended the food and we couldn't have been happier. Catfish was the bomb and my burger was 2and best that I've ever had in my life.",
   "Enjoyed a variety of foods - fried pickles, deviled eggs and ragoons for appetizers. All were very tasty. The last (2) had a mild bite to them, but not \"Nashville\" hot. Food was great, the moonshine drinks were very tasty, and the service was awesome. We stayed and chatted with our friends for a long time, and even though they were cleaning up - allowed us to continue enjoying our conversations. Great experience, and would definitely go back again.",
   "Good hangout and busy! I had the pizza and it was way too doughy for my liking. Then I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was way too salty. Service was good and drinks were on point. The deviled eggs were very tasty. If I came back I\u2019d get a burger most likely."

The Lemon Artichoke Soup is legendary in it's own right!\nBe aware that sitting is limited and reservations are recommended. Valet parking is still complementary and a great bonus.",
   "I have been coming here for years. I don't go here a lot, but we always seem to find ourselves coming back when we are in town. The food is always wonderful and they offer a shuttle to events downtown. I ordered the Scallops with Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was amazing. My mom had the Shrimp and Grits, which she liked. We shared a bread pudding, which was good, not great, in my opinion. I am a pastry chef and am a little picky. We didn't have a reservation, but we were able to sit at the bar. One thing that most people might like, was that our food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered. We were hoping to enjoy a nice meal there and wish that it hadn't been so rushed. We hung out a while, then ordered dessert, I still gave them 5 stars because we had great food and the bartender is super friendly and attentive. I would certainly go back, since the food is consistently great.",

Drinks were delicious. Food was outstanding. I had specials (salad and halibut)...delicious!!! We were a party of 10. We appreciated that were very accomodating. And the prices weren't bad. Around $50 a head for cocktails and great food",
   "Well-priced, traditional American cooking in a homey setting. \n\nI stopped by around lunchtime on a weekday, and the place was bustling but not packed. Friendly, efficient staff. Good quality food at yesteryear's prices. The chicken tenders (pictured) were some of the largest and best-tasting I've had, and that's one of my standard pub-grub dishes. Definitely recommended for breakfast/lunch, I'll be back next time I'm in Nashville."

   "Our family was looking for a nice dining establishment for our last night in Nashville. The meals are very good but are basically a-la-cart. They will suggest ordering a green, protein, and dessert. Depending on how many adults are at the table it can add up with multiple greens and proteins in a hurry even sharing the dishes. However, our server was very nice and knowledgeable of the ingredients in the dishes we ordered. It is more like a neighborhood type restaurant and is moderately small. We enjoyed our evening and the food was very good.",
   "Great, local ingredients drive the menu at this hip standby in Nashville. All of the flavors of the South are present and wonderful without the expected heaviness of the region. The outdoor patio has a nice atmosphere, and the nearby greenery adds to the freshness and feeling of being connected to the local flavors. Service is relaxed yet serious, with a great knowledge of what's happening in the kitchen but in no way forced on the diner.",

Wonderful to see so many unique, homemade pasta options on the menu and the culinary wisdom to pair with selected proteins, herbs and flavors. Definitely glad we went off the path to dine here!",
   "A very nice atmosphere and some yummy food. I really liked this place and would recommend it for a date night. The pasta entrees were nice but I enjoyed the beet dish most of all.\nMy partner and I did make reservations, but were asked to sit at the bar when we got there. The price point and portion sizes were a bit off."

We would want to return our next time in Nashville.",

We were passing through Nashville on vacation on March 14, 2020 and thought why not. We found this \"hidden gem\" to be located in an old converted residence in part of N.

From ribs to friend chicken cornbread bread pudding potato salad greens etc... the staff was very friendly and helpful. This place a quite the experience and worth the price.",

We're from Minneapolis, met a local and a couple from Chicago and China. All of the food was amazing. Great southern food. My favorite was the catfish. Fresh and not fishy, cornmeal breading was dry and crispy. Great sides and leave room for dessert!"

   "One of my favorite restaurants in Nashville! Unfortunately didn't have a chance to try their raw bar menu but the cooked dishes were phenomenal. We had the wood roasted oysters with green curry, the seared sea scallops and the the red snapper. Really liked the kick that the green curry added to the oysters. As for the scallops, they were seared to perfection and the butternut squash ribbons paired delectably well. The red snapper was meaty and tender. The orange butter was super flavorful. Portion size is on the smaller end but I guess it would just allow you to taste test more of their fantastic menu!",
   "We sat at the bar. Matt was great. Cocktails were perfect. Every dish was like a piece of art. Just took in the view before being blown away by the flavor.",
   "The waitress will tell you that you need at least two dishes per person to 'share' and that does make for a fun night, but you need to be really hungry if you order both a first course and an entree to share with a dinner companion. I would start small and add more as needed...their service is super quick. We would have had just oysters and our first course options if we had thought ahead. It can be pricey...but it is just plain good.",
   "Attentive service, good food. Very loud place. Stand out was sunflower seed risotto, even better than the nice red snapper. Octopus salad is delightful. Homemade potato chips were made right, crisp not soggy with very light whipped dip.",
   "Loved the brunch! The eggs and beans dish was incredible and everybody else at my table really enjoyed what they had as well. Not my favorite bloody mary, but it wasn't bad. The mimosas looked great, though. Monkey bread was also amazing for sharing with a group of 5."

The main dishes were good and appetizer was surprisingly delicious! The portion was what you expected at a more chic restaurant: nice but leave you wanting a bit more. The dessert was underwhelming for the occasion. Felt like it could be done for a while and served without much plating. Decent drinks with generous pour. Overall good experience but could be better. Would recommend~",
   "Me and my wife enjoy this place due to the changing menu and that it feels like an experience. We've never had a dish that made us go, \"eh it's okay.\" It's always been amazing and we look forward to the next trip every time we leave. This isn't a place you go to massive portions but rather reasonable ones full of flavor. We love it here.",
   "To start this a Mediterranean-style restaurant - \"The Mediterranean diet is rich in lean proteins, like chicken, fish and legumes; fresh fruits and vegetables; whole, unprocessed grains; seeds and nuts; healthy fats like olive oil; and a limited intake of dairy and red meats.\" The environment boasts a slick interior that screams \"Hip and Cool\", which comes with a premium in price. And the food is bomb. I had the Hummus and Avocado Crispy Rice (added the shawarma chicken thigh to the rice dish).",
   "This was overall a really good experience. Bar was set really high and it delivered on most expectations.\n\nThe restaurant itself was beautiful.  Really nice overall package here. Highly recommend sitting at the open kitchen.\n\nService was good. Our server was really knowledgeable on the menu and pretty attentive.\n\nDrink menu was also really good. So much to choose from.\n\nFood itself was excellent. Presentation was good. We liked about 2/3 of what we ordered, which is really good. Whipped feta is a must.",
   "Wow, what a creative menu and space. Menu changes and has a Mediterranean fair, we had roasted cauliflower, Israeli fried chicken, and roasted carrots. Everything was delicious with lots of of different seasoning. The fried chicken was the star, super crisp and moist and not your Nashville hot chicken! Drinks are also very creative with lots of different flavors. We'll be back!"

   "Simply amazing food and service...not to mention music!  I ordered the duck and it was perfect.  Crispy skin and oh so tender and flavorful.  The lobster bisque was silky and had tons of flavor.  \n\nI sat at the bar and the service was attentive but not overbearing, friendly and helpful, and felt like I was at a neighborhood bar. \n\nGreat band playing ad well and it generated a vibe throughout the entire place.",
   "We had such a wonderful experience! The management team should be proud! Tori, got us in on a cancellation reservation and we had what I think was the best seat in the house for the show. The food was amazing, our server was incredible. The entire staff helped each other out. I received food and drink recommendations and was checked on many times. The show and music was amazing. Keep it up, you guys are amazing. BEST IN NASHVILLE",
   "We stopped in here for a drink as we planned to sample the bars along Printer\u2019s Alley. We were not disappointed. We walked in and it was dark and sultry, and a pianist was playing some awesome jazz. We were able to stand near the bar, get a drink, and absolutely enjoy everything around us. The sights, the sounds, the smells - the food looked amazing!! I can\u2019t wait to go back!",
   "I completely cherished everything about this spot! The nourishment decisions are restricted, however it's well justified, despite all the trouble. I was unable to pick between the pork hacks and the fish extraordinary of the day (sword fish with shrimp) and I requested that our server shock me. I'm happy she picked swordfish for me since it was totally flavorful. I would prescribe reserving a spot. We had 8PM reservations on a Sunday and was situated promptly, and wound up remaining until near to 12 PM. The mood is in no way like what you would consider when you consider going to Nashville yet it is a GREAT change from Broadway. I'd go to Nashville again and avoid the entire Broadway strip to come directly to the back street and eat at Skull's Rainbow Room. Our server's name was Sarah and she offered remarkable assistance!",
   "We wandered into Skull's one night after midnight. Most of the dinner guests had departed but the action around the bar was still shakin'. Within minutes of getting our drinks we felt that we had known the bartender and bar back for years. Both Levi and Pearce had just the right amount of confidence, hospitality, smoothness and sage wisdom. Not every bartender wants to serve every guest. I could easily read between the lines that Levi was a professional and even if you were an a**hole he would treat you right."

We were there right when they opened so they were still getting it going for the night but it was good. Alex was our server and he was great. Bread pudding was to die for...go just for that and it is a great night.  Meals were exceptional, outstanding wine selection, very comfortable atmosphere. Highly recommend for a relaxing dinner!",
   "As a Nashville Native this place has seemed to be around for forever, so we decided to give it a shot since we\u2019d never heard anything from anyone we knew about the place. And it was a very good decision. It seems much more like the Nashville originals of yesterday (and that is a huge compliment). Our service was very good and attentive along with delicious food. The ambiance is a bit open but still comfortable. We had the bone marrow app, I had the paella and my friend chose the vegetarian dish. They were all delicious! We will be back. A great place for couples/groups as well.",
   "Where do I begin? I will start with the food since that is the first thing people look at. Everything was exceptional! We had the following - Hot Chicken and Waffles, Fried Green Tomatoes, Shrimp and Grits, Crab Cakes, Seven Fish of the Sea, Tortellini sub Chicken as the meat, a special request Reuben, and chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nThe shrimp and grits were by far our favorite. I am a bit picky after having what I considered the best in Charleston until I found this place. I highly recommend everything on the menu, but especially the shrimp and grits. The hot chicken and waffles were such a great starter. It had a perfect heat and sweetness. The fried green tomatoes also had a light heat and blend of flavors and perfect crunch. \n\nI can\u2019t say enough great things about the food. You can\u2019t go wrong here, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask your server for something special. The Reuben is only on the menu for lunch, and our friend wanted chicken on the tortellini, which was also fantastic, and our waiter was extremely accommodating and had great suggestions. The chef and manager also came over to make sure everything was perfect. \n\nThis was an all around amazing experience. We will be back!",

My wife ordered the halibut and it was tasty as well. This is a place that I would recommend for special occasions as dinner bill can get expensive, but every bite is worth the price.",
   "The food here is excellent.  They are by no means on the cheap side but you get what you pay for here. The salad bar is long fresh with multiple selections.  It can get loud as the place is small.  The servers here are top notch and we have never had an issue with service.",
   "It's a must to try the their steak when you are in Nashville and the food is great. One serving is enough for two person and you can split it.",
   "I would like to thank Mark, the manager at Sperry's Belle Meade. There was a mistake on our take-out order and the person who was taking the order was not apologetic and had no idea what he was doing. Mark, however, handled the situation very well. He knew what he was doing and he was so apologetic and kind for the mistake that happened. Honestly if it wasn't for Mark I would not be going back to Sperry's at all. Thank you Mark for doing your job exceptionally well!",
   "One of my favorite restaurants! I love the ambiance, the service is impeccable and the steaks are melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Reservations are a must. Parking is tight, but  valet parking is available. Dress is casual, but definitely not messy. I wore jeans and a nice sweater. Even if you don't normally order dessert, have their signature peppermint ice cream with chocolate sauce! It's the perfect ending to a delicious meal."

Heck, I think I liked my French dip sandwich way more than any non-vegan ones I\u2019ve ever had! The service was great and kind, and the space is laid back. We even had a bit of a spill and one of the servers, Ash, was super sweet and gracious to us. Definitely hope I find myself there again some day!",
   "Today I went on a lunch date with my friend and a friend and boy did we have the surprise of our lives! We shared the Nacho appetizer and it was to die for! We each had a different entree and my friend did not want to talk the food was so good! What we experienced today was healthy food with out of this world flavor x 10! The only regret that we has was not coming sooner! Thank you Wild Cow, you are my new go to vegan establishment!",
   "Wild Cow is my favorite restaurant. I live in Portland, OR but luckily I have family in Nashville. When I visit we always make a point to go. I\u2019ve never been disappointed in anything I\u2019ve ordered here. Last time, my mom and I both ordered the beans and greens bowl with tofu. Now we\u2019re each trying to recreate it at home.\n\nWild Cow, please come out with a cookbook! Or maybe post a few recipes on your website? \n\nThe new location is more spacious and comfortable. We love it!",
   "As a vegetarian trying to become vegan, I need more places like this closer to where I live. The food is absolutely delicious. And not even compared to regular meat and cheese. Just delicious period. Paired with a friendly atmosphere and kind staff, this place is a must for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike!",
   "Ate here twice during a recent stay in Nashville.  The server (I cannot remember her name unfortunately) was fantastic during our first visit!  She answered all of our questions about the menu and made recommendations.  She was clearly very knowledgeable about the menu and veganism in general and was extremely friendly and helpful.  She definitely made eating here a pleasant experience.  The food was fantastic!  Generous portion sizes and great flavors.  There were lots of options to choose from and many gluten-free choices too, which is fantastic.  The restaurant itself also had a lively atmosphere and was clean, bright and modern.  I can highly recommend this restaurant for the health-conscious vegan or otherwise as there is something for everyone.  Wish there were more restaurants like this in the States!"

Luke was server and right on time with suggestions and service. The wine by the glass selection here is tops! Decided on the grouper special, it was excellent. nice Chardonnay by the glass and another wonderful experience was in the books.",
   "We were on our first trip to Nashville And when we were driving to our hotel we got the munchies and decided on this place because of good overall Google reviews.  The service was good..  Everyone we interacted with helpful.  The food was plentiful so you may want to split a dish if you are not too hungry.  In our case, we took the left overs back to our room and ate the rest as another meal.  As you can see from the picture the food was delicious.  I would recommend the fried chili garlic grits if you like grits or even if you don't.  Recommend this place for a nice delicious meal and good service.",
   "You enter into a relaxed environment where the mood is set to lead to a great evening.  \nFine dining feel and the food to match the vibe, the drinks were also delicious.

Greeted at the door by friendly staff and seated quickly. Atmosphere was relaxing, warm, and comfortable. Waiter, Josh, came by quickly and took care of us with skill and care. The food was amazing.  Will put it on our GoTo places to eat.",
   "Steak prepared perfectly, loaded potatoes a must, with grilled asparagus.   A real taste treat for all the senses.   Service was top notch, too.  Hector went the extra mile to help the bartender prepare a Smith and Kern's after dinner liquor.  The perfect way to end a perfect meal."

The margaritas were great as well, nice & strong! I really appreciated the service platter that the tacos came out on, it made the meal feel more communal. The only downside was the lack lustre service, but it was busy so that was likely a factor.",
   "Really good mexican food in Nashville. We can here for early lunch and our bartender, Marshall, was just awesome. He really made the meal fun for us and provided great recommendations. It's always better sitting at the bar when the bartender is able to bring an element to the experience. Definitely recommend!",
   "Hot spot for elevated tacos. Enjoyed the hongos taco as a vegetarian option. Roasted cauliflower was delicious. Fairly priced. Excellent service and food was delivered very quickly after placing order. It's typically busy and a bit noisy so maybe not the best for quiet conversations but great for pretty much any other occasion.",
   "Do you see these tacos? They are just as delicious as they are photogenic. The drinks were stellar. I had the spicy pineapple margarita - whew...first couple sips open your sinuses but after that it's smooth sailing. I love the atmosphere of this spot. Community tables. Very chill. Love the decor and the service was great! Will definitely come back.",
   "Great bar staff! Thank's for the stellar drinks, and awesome recommendations on where to execute our super fun rooftop bar crawl. And we returned later for the great taco menu.  Bakersfield is modern,  relevant and active Nashville! Must go!"

The experience is like having a personal chef prepare your meal in front of you. The atmosphere is unique. It is a blend of bar and fine dining. The service is also top notch. Everyone there is super friendly and attentive. All of the dishes were well explained and brought at well timed intervals. If you like trying new things, experiencing fine dining, or want a unique experience then this is the place to go.",
   "Although I have been to The Chef and I, my friend has not . This place is always packed so I planned ahead and secured a spot for two at the counter. This is entertainment and dining all rolled into one. He enjoyed watching the organized chaos of the chefs and their kitchen dance - you can be interactive and ask questions about techniques and ingredients as the meals are cooked . I had sable fish over pearled couscous- a first time for this fish and it was fabulous . Although there is technically kit a \u201cbar\u201d the servers are very attentive and make sure your glass is never empty. This is a lively place and has good energy .",
   "Make sure to make a reservation. We came here on a Friday night and sat at the chef's table. We had the taquitos and crab and lobster bisque for app, both were delicious and portions we're generous. I wish I had stopped at that since I was full at the end of our app course. Then for the main dish we ordered the short ribs and the duck. They were both phenomenal dishes. The short ribs was super tender and delicious with lots of meat (10+ oz) and potatoes. The duck was made just perfect with pink hues all inside and crispy skin on the outside. The duck came with a large portion of potatoes+cheese combo, so you'll for sure be full just eating this dish alone. Eating at the chef's table is a must since it's entertaining and a fun date idea.",
   "Some of the best food you can eat. Seriously. Strongly suggest you sit at the chefs counter in this open kitchen concept as you'll enjoy the amazing skills the chefs show as they make your food. \n\nThe cocktails are awesome and made to perfection. The 5-7 course tasting menu is a must and will give you a good idea of the range they have to offer. If you're in Nashville be sure to make reservations!",
   "I liked this place a lot. It is very small and I understood that they are doing a course menu if you would like to sit facing kitchen and you have to reserve your spots. Their menu is very easy to understand. One of the most memorable appetizers and awesome presentation was Cauliflower with goat cheese! Elk tenderloin was very good too."

It tasted like they were making the mashed potatoes with water instead of milk. Been working in restaurants for years and I could tell there was no milk in them. That\u2019s absolutely disgusting. During these tough times you should be raising standards and giving your best possible product. Not lowering standards and cutting corners to make an extra buck. Very disappointed. Better places to spend my money right now.",

Size of greens salad was questionable.  Very small for 10 bucks. I saw someone eating a salad at the bar and it was a huge bowl of greens. The portion I got was not.\nI ordered food at the bar,  while I waited I had a beer. The people on either side of me had there food before I got mine and they sat down 15 or 20 minutes after me. The bar tender apologized for the delay, but never offered any compensation.  It would have been a courtesy to comp my beer or something small to make up for my 45 minute wait for my food.",

They also have late night live music which we haven\u2019t yet seen but notice when walking by at night. This is always our very first spot to eat when visiting town.",
   "Thought the idea of a grocery store turned restaurant would be cool to see, so I went.  It was alright, but nothing special.  Was loud and when music started, even louder, which would be expected, so that didn't really bother me.  The music was not good the night I was there.  I am sure that's hit or miss.  Food was so so.  Overall, the experience was average.   I don't see me going back.",
   "Southern comfort food without all the pretentiousness and high tourist prices. Reece was our server. He was courteous; food come out in record time, which was great because we were hungry.

   "Missed reviewing Peg Leg Porker BBQ. All of the barbecue places we visited while in TN, were based on what the internet gave as the best reviews according to customers, magazine articles, etc. \n\nPeg Leg Porker BBQ is a very casual place with informal seating and self service, in that you go in, order your food, pay, get a number, and pick it up at the counter when your number is called. You sit where you like while you wait, though the wait is brief. The bar is at the opposite side of the room, and you order your drinks to bring them back to your table. There seemed to be a regular customer clientele seated here. \n\nOn my companion\u2019s quest for great barbecue while in TN, this was on the must visit list. We ordered a rack of ribs to share and the mac and cheese side along with crinkled fries. The dry rub and the ribs were good. The sides were average. Tables with students and seniors appeared to be having a good time whether eating ribs, pulled pork or wings. The prices are reasonable. \n\nThere is a lot of brand merchandise for sale for customers who love this place or visitors who choose this as a destination place. Worth the visit if you're visiting multiple barbecue places to find what you consider the best. \n.",
   "Stayed at the Hutton Hotel (excellent) and the valet suggested this place. The ribs were served dry which \"let's the meat speak for itself.\" It did and what a statement. The meat was tender, juicy and tasty. This place is a keeper and next time through Nashville I will be there again. Take friends with you. They take reservations for groups. Beats the wait in line. Ran out of ribs but the chicken was great. Pork was also outstanding. Mac and cheese and smoked green beans are a must. Sat upstairs and apart from the nachos taking awhile the service was great.",
   "Basing this off of a single delivery meal of ribs, beans and slaw, but it was that good. While there a some other good bbq shops here (Central, Edley's & Martin's), this is among the best I've had in Nashville. I will definitely be ordering again to try more of the menu.",
   "This place had a line of 20 people when it opened at 11am!!! But after eating here I know why. The pulled pork was the best I\u2019ve ever had... no fat and perfectly cooked pork. My husband had the ribs and they literally fell off the bone. Prices are reasonable and portions are generous!",
   "Our office has ordered catering from all of the BBQ Restaurants in Nashville.  As much as we like all of them, we keep coming back to Peg Leg Porker.  As a matter of fact, all  of our employees prefers Peg Leg. The food is always delivered HOT, as well as, top-notch quality and the quantity is always plentiful.  They always provide more than enough food.  Their catering service is also top-quality.  They never disappoint.  If you are looking to have BBQ catered to your home or office, I would highly recommend Peg Leg Porker.  Believe me, you will not be disappointed.  Plus, they are a family owned establishment, not a chain, and it's always good practice to promote our local restaurants."

   "We went a bit too late to try the Stromboli and garlic knots. We did order a few slices from the walk up menu after 11:30pm on a Monday night and it was quick. We ordered a pepperoni slice and a meat lovers. I only have a picture of the meat lovers because we both devoured the pepperoni. It was our favourite! I wouldn\u2019t be lying if I said that the pepperoni slice is in my top 3 all time best pizza I\u2019ve ever had! Good job!!",
   "Hands down my favorite pizza place in Nashville. The crust is always the perfect consistency and cooked to perfection. The flavors are great. Perfect for any night or get together. Great location in a fun neighborhood. Service is also great. Can\u2019t wait until I come back!",
   "No photos because we were so hungry \ud83d\ude0b. My daughter doesn\u2019t like BBQ so on our way back to Chattanooga we stopped at this place that was recommended. We went to the take out side and ordered three slices. In a few minutes we were back on our travels and ate yummy pizza. The cheese was excellent and dough soft. We will be traveling back to Tennessee in a few months and will visit their sit down location soon!",
   "Terrific pizza\nWe saw customers buying takeout pizza as soon as the store opened at 11 am so we had an inkling that the pizza was good.  We went back at lunch time and ordered just a slice to try.  That one slice became three slices, arugula salad and garlic knots with hot marinara sauce.  It was just delicious - thin and crispy base with minimal toppings!",
   "Went there short line. There was a guy that had ordered a head and was waiting for his name to be call, but didn\u2019t know apparently you have to get in the order line when you arrive then move to pick up line. Very confusing and the guy was not thrill. The order taker was nice. The guy that called my name and lay my order on the pick up was unfriendly. Also, I heard another employee say \u201c Tony bologna.\u201d  As my name is Tony. First, I started to say something real ugly but I let it slide. The guy was ugly as hell and look like some Bologna. I would have went in on him for being ignorant."

   "I've been to a lot of good restaurants and I have to say this one is one of the best I've been to. The service was top notch, ton of history, great ambiance and amazing food. Rarely write reviews but felt compelled to after a great experience here. Our waiter Sean was amazing and the hostess Mrs. Smith was such a sweet heart. Highly recommend",
   "I dropped in for a members luncheon in February and had the distinct privilege of meeting Josh and Jerry and hanging out at The Standard that afternoon. What a fantastic place, truly unique and the food was absolutely incredible! This is a MUST STOP for anyone visiting Nashville!!! I will not be back to Nashville without first making a reservation here! Truly the BEST OF NASHVILLE!",
   "One of the most amazing experiences.  If you have not tried this gem, it is a must.  First off you are greeted by the most amazing hostess I have ever met.  Such southern hospitality.  She is such a mom, which makes the experience so beautiful as it was.  We were greeted and introduced and taken to the bar to sit before we had dinner.  The bar atmosphere is so beautiful.  The whole restaurant is breath taking to begin with.  I have not even gotten to the food.  We were seated, and she kept checking on our dining experience the whole time.  The food melts in your mouth.  A must when you come to nashville!!  Many know about it, our first time.  I would come back...just to experience \"mom\" again.  Such a beautiful soul and thank you for making my birthday so amazing as you did.  I felt I was at home.  13,000 sq foot facility...looking at the front of the home you would never know.",
   "This is a must visit while in Nashville! \n\nThe bar has a great selection of whiskey and wine. It\u2019s a cozy bar with a fireplace, unfortunately live music wasn\u2019t an option the night I visited. \n\nWas too busy eating the rest of my meal and didn\u2019t get more pics. The sampler appetizer isn\u2019t listed on the menu but it\u2019s a must order; fried green tomatoes, calamari and the low country shrimp. The Standard Filet....  nothing more to say, order it and thank me later!",
   "What a great place! Great food (with an accmpanying price!) great atmosphere, great service, and a unique location. The Standard is located at the Smith house and is the oldest building in Nashville. There are tons of cool nooks and crannies, including a hidden room behind a brick wall!\nExcellent place to go for dinner, drinks, or just to relax. Highly recommended."

The pulled pork, mac and cheese, and fried tomatoes were to die for and were served cafeteria-style by helpful and cheery employees. The whole plate and a large sweet tea cost ~$13, a great value. Loved it!",
   "Hands down some of the best Southern food I've had. The experience was just fantastic. Staff and customer service: hands down what food service should be. Now the food...the banana pudding was pretty sinful. And I can't tell you the last time I had fried catfish but I guarantee you it didn't taste like this did. It is worth the line. It doesn't take long. They move very quickly and diligently with ordering. Trust me. Just try it.",

   "We found this restaurant on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and saw it had thousands of 5 star ratings. It was humble but the ratty parking lot was full even though it costs $5 to park. We were greeted warmly and told how to order (cafeteria style - grab a tray and walk through the line). We tried foods like collard greens and grits and loved them both. The fried chicken was amazing. It is quite possibly the best food I have ever had. I also enjoyed the cafeteria seating sitting next to smiley strangers at long tables in the crowded room. No one gasped when we prayed over our food. We will be back!"

   "What a great Venue, since the moment we sat down until our departure. \nService was on point. Our meal was just amazing. One of the best meal I had in Nashville so far. Wine, drinks and most of all food. Good job Abbey \ud83d\ude0a\nComplementary valet parking or pay to park around the corner. We left talking about when can we make our next visit. Cheers!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",
   "Delicious food, great atmosphere. My wife and I had brunch there on a Saturday, late morning. The pistachio sticky buns we're sticky and tasty. The leek and mushroom quiche was twice as high as expected for \"one\" slice and tasty, too. But the dried cherries and orange brussel sprouts were awesome!! Hope to go again when we go back to Nashville.",
   "So much to love. Surrounded by a beautiful restaurant you'll be treated well by a welcoming staff. Food is delicious. Couple of highlights are the beef tongue, and papperdelle. Chicken for 2 was filling and fantastic. The place has the whole package and I'm excited to return.",
   "Josephine has one of the top teams in Nashville.  From the time you walk in the door you feel welcome and relaxed.  The lighting is perfect and the setup is cozy yet chic.  The menu has a some staples, one of which is the chicken for 2 which is always spot on.  The seasonal additions are always a fun way to try something new.  Each dish is beautifully prepared and there is a good balance of veggies with every entree.  Dessert is a great addition with both seasonal specials and classics like the apple cobbler.  I feel right at home when I have dinner here and always look forward to the next visit. And don't forget your ginger snap cookies which are a special treat handed to you on the way out!",
   "Beautiful setting and trendy neighborhood.  Had the Winston cocktail which was a good bourbon based old fashioned drink. Had the beef tongue; good flavor with the caramelized onion.  Though I expect the beef tongue to be slices instead of shredded.  I would be more impressed if it was sliced and sear.  Scallop was perfectly cooked but the okra was a bit overcooked which was hard to chew.  Overall great place but not blown away."

   "We were thrilled with the pacing of the dishes! We have been to a number of tapas restaurants here and in other parts of the world, and have usually been disappointed in many dishes brought out at the same time. Maybe because they're so small, they can really take care of the customers, and this care shows and is so appreciated! The cocktails are tasty, and if you're a G&T fan (I'm not), there's a large menu just for those. Yes, the food portions are fairly small, but the tastes are fantastic! I won't list the dishes we had, since they'll always be changing. We're definitely going back, probably seasonally, to continue to enjoy their culinary magic. Service was so friendly and attentive - loved it!",
   "Such an amazing place. If you want a dining experience and not just eat dinner, this is it. We were really impressed that Craig brought his passion for this place to the front of the house!\n\nLoved the shared dish style of service. The Grouper with horseradish foam was our fav, but the rabbit, and pork cheeks were super tasty as well.\n\nKiller cocktails that blew away our pre dinner drinks at Attaboy. Great G&T menu. The housemade amaro was super tasty.\n\nWe rarely get to double back on places to eat/review, but this would be one of those places.\nSAVOR- 5 out 5",
   "Such an unique experience.  Make sure to check out the BTB wine list... for an amazing collection of old and new, interesting and special wines. \"Peninsula\" for the Iberian peninsula, bringing extraordinary bites from Portugal and Spain with an experienced twist.  Absolutely a must for the most adventurous among us!!!",
   "Peninsula is divine. Well thought out wine list, amazing cocktails and the food is off the charts. Get the rabbit stew...you will not be disappointed. Delicious. And save room for dessert.",
   "Exceptionally unique and beyond delicious dishes. All dishes came in a form that we weren't expecting at all.  The chef here deconstructs and rebuilds the dish a unique way. We were pleasantly surprised with the form of almost everything. \n\nThere should be a popup store that sells only the rabbit stew + toasted croutons. That dish still has me dreaming about it.\n\nOn the negative side, I really didn't care for their take on pan con tomate. It has this heavy aioli/mayo that really weighs down the start to a meal, and the sesame seeds annoyingly get stuck in your teeth without adding much to the dish. \n\nWe loved the lobster, adding bonito on top gives a great umami and the crunch of the cracker contrasts the otherwise soft elements. \n\nThe cauliflower was really one to noodle on. Would have expected the scallop to be the main component but it's dried and ground almost as a  breadcrumb on top. The flavors were so spectacular, definitely order this. \n\nMy wife is still glowing about the crema catalana ice cream. Sweet, salty from the potato chips and caviar, crunch from the bruleed sugar. It was everything. \n\nHighly recommend this place, so happy to see creative cooking in Nashville as opposed to the monotony of southern family style cooking restaurants."

   "We really enjoyed the food and ambiance at this restaurant. We love Indian food and weren't disappointed by this more modern take on traditional Indian food. The decor, lighting, and atmosphere were very soothing and relaxing. Not overly loud so could easily hold a conversation with my friend (LOL). We had appetizers earlier so wish we had ordered one meal to share because we were going to a show and could not take any leftovers with us. The portions were very generous, the huge chunks of lamb were perfectly cooked, and the sauces were moderately spiced and very enjoyable. Honestly, we nearly had an entire meal left and were disappointed to leave so much great food. All of the staff were friendly and engaging. Would highly recommend and look forward to returning and eating ALL of our food on our next trip to Nashville.",

All 5 of us loved our food and cocktails. The cheesecake was also fantastic. We will definitely be back!",
   "Great appetizers and wonderful ideas about Indian fusion cuisine.  The main courses were less than what we expected. Very mild, even sweet.  Their duck was sweet, the meat & three was made up of sweet vegetables and just edible chicken.\n\nNo need for dessert once you finish your meal.  \nThe staff was very nice and helpful."

The sauce was amazing and they offered bread to sop up the extra because everyone generally loves it so much. Will be returning for another fine dining night",

Special shout out to the General Manager Dan G. for making our night out with the little one extra special. He checked on us multiple times to make sure that we were being taken care of. His professionalism and hospitality is over and beyond. It makes perfect since why quality and service is top notch here with a GM like that!!",

   "This is a must try dining experience when you\u2019re in Nashville (if you can score a reservation).\n\nThe restaurant itself is almost a secret entrance of sorts connected to its sister bar. It\u2019s gorgeous inside and everyone (for the most part) sits at the chef\u2019s counter.  You basically get 1 on 1 service from very skilled chefs. The ambience was so unique.\n\nOverall service was some of the best we\u2019ve had. It was so nice chatting to the chef about places he\u2019s tried and to see how passionate he was about food\u2014it was amazing. \n\nDrink menu was top notch. So many good cocktails, wine and beer that it\u2019s tough to make a choice.\n\nFood was incredible. Bold flavours and great portion sizes. Did not leave there feeling like I needed to be loaded with a forklift but I was plenty full.  The menu layout was so unique and we loved it. \n\nIt was just such a great experience. Will 100% go back when we are in Nashville next time.",
   "This is a fantastic dining experience in a `secret` room off from the side of the bar.  The staff was absolutely top notch, answering any question you might have, and providing a very welcoming environment. Instead of choosing, we just did the Bring It All and Fly Blind combination. At the end, don't miss the private bar inside as they have a top notch bartender and selection of whisky/drinks.",
   "Went for our daughter\u2019s birthday. Did the entire tasting menu plus wine pairing. Everything was exceptional. Portions are small but every bite is meant to be savored. Truly a delight for epicures. If you value quantity for the price, this is not the place for you. If you enjoy experiencing new and unusual, yet remarkable tastes, bastion is a great destination. Staff is friendly, helpful, attentive, and unpretentious. Atmosphere is unique. Take time to get a drink at the private bar before dinner.",
   "I am just speechless. Every dish was perfectly balanced. They put together ingredients that I individually dislike and made them taste beautiful. What a wonderful meal. The drinks and the service were incredible as well.",
   "Got a last minute reservation at 9:30pm and went straight here from the airport on day one of vacation. We sat at the bar and had a great dinner. Seems like they're just a bunch of really talented, dedicated young chefs who enjoy making really amazing dishes. Staff heard we were visiting and wrote out a bunch of other dining spots we should check out."

The clam pizza is a must if you like clams/seafood, or if you're feeling adventurous. Service was especially good this time around (I believe our server was Hannah.). I will be back the next time I'm in Nashville.",
   "Such a great place with super staff. Everyone who works here has extensive knowledge of the menu and they serve very well. I always recommend!",
   "Our new favorite restaurant! The pizza is to die for - best dough in the city. Cocktails were great. Everything else on the menu was fantastic but the pizza was definitely the best. Will come back many times to sit at the bar and get a pizza with a couple of drinks."

   "We sat at the bar for lunch on a Saturday here. Our bartender was excellent and made a fantastic Bloody Mary. Our food was great, we just ordered sandwiches but they were very tasty. Even the free popcorn they hand out at the bar was delicious! We ended up spending more time here than we expected just because it was such a great atmosphere. We would definitely come back.",
   "First off, I got a genuine smile from every person on staff when I walked in. And it just got better from there. My waiter Jimmy was friendly, fun, and gave me an excellent whiskey recommendation! The fried catfish sandwich was straight up excellent. Real, home style cornmeal fried catfish with a house made tarter sauce that puts it right over the top. This was the best place I went to on my entire trip to Nashville! Great job guys!",
   "I had a WONDERFUL evening! I spent my 3 year anniversary here with my boyfriend and we both had a great night! We made reservations online, and when I called to verify my reservations we told them we were celebrating three years together. All of the staff made us feel very welcomed and special on our night. They all signed a card for us too! My waitress was very sweet and always made sure we had refills. She even told the chef to make my chicken, which was so delicious, into the shape of a heart! We will definitely be spending our 4th anniversary here!",
   "Unbelievably wonderful staff at Merchants! A hand made Birthday card was presented to me after our meal in lieu of dessert. Went way out of their way for my gluten intolerance. Food was absolutely delicious too.",
   "Excellent food and affordable for Broadway.  Party of five seated quickly upstairs on a Saturday night.  Good pours.  Spotty service though.  Manager was very helpful.  Our personal server was so so."

   "We went to the Melrose location, the was a small line, but we only waited maybe 20-30 minutes from when we got there until we were served our food. We both went with sandwich\u2019s. My friend isn\u2019t big on spicy so he went with mild which he said was very enjoyable, just a hint of spice that builds a little. I like spicy but was too chicken to get the hot, which is the fourth spicy option, there are two levels above hot. The Medium was a nice amount of heat without being uncomfortably hot. Looking back I should have gotten Hot. The chicken was moist all the way through. The collard greens were good and the red skin potato salad was average. Overall very good chicken!",
   "Line was long but only had to wait about 40 minutes to get served. The chicken was absolutely amazing. I did the medium and it was just spicy enough for me. Macaroni and crinkle fries were great sides I had with it. I should of ordered small dark instead of large dark. Way to much food, got a to go box and will be able to enjoy some chicken tomorrow. If you get to Nashville it\u2019s a must go to restaurant. The staff was awesome also, friendly and always had a smile on their face.",
   "Tried it for the first time today and it was amazing. My husband and I both got the same thing. 3 chicken tenders which are good size and it comes with two sides. We got fries and the pimento mac n cheese. I'm not big on pimentos but you couldn't even taste that. It was all VERY good. I got medium spice and my husband got hot and it was perfect. Good spice level if you like spicy and good flavor at the same time. Will definitely be back. The guy working the register was super helpful and nice as well. Great customer service!!",
   "A number of us went to the restaurant. People got the chicken sandwiches and chicken tenders with all 4 types of heat you can put on the tenders. Everyone enjoyed their sandwiches, a few stating they were better than others they had experienced in chain restaurants. We got the mac and cheese and fries as sides which were very good. I got the Gluten Free chicken tenders, no sauce due to food allergies, they were cooked just right, moist and tendrer.",
   "A must visit! This is hands down the best run out of the group. The line was long but went fast and totally worth the wait. Super clean and friendly. The mild chicken tenders did not disappoint and the Mac and Cheese is the BEST! The greens are big, leafy, and tasty. Local craft beers are on tap and very cold. I don't care how much of a hurry we are in we always have time for this Hattie B restaurant."

   "Our table of 4 was anticipating the experience and we were not disappointed. We loved the way the food was presented and explained by the wait staff. But even better, Chef Vivek Surti then tells a story of how this dish made it to the menu as related to a childhood memory or a family member. We really felt like we had been invited to his home to dine. Definitely a unique experience.",
   "What an incredible evening! I think Heather manages the front of the house, and she was extremely accommodating due to a loss in the family on my girlfriend's side. I couldn't be more grateful to her and the restaurant for their help. When we visited this past weekend, myself and everyone in our party was blown away! The flavors, wine pairings, service, ambiance, etc, etc, etc was absolutely perfect! The atmosphere was very welcoming and unpretentious and we loved Chef Vivek's explanation of each dish. The price was more than reasonable and we finished without feeling overly stuffed or hungry. There is so much thought that goes into each course and each pairing and the execution shines when left with the experience. I will definitely be back.",
   "Chef Vivek hosted a wonderful dinner, felt like I was at a friends place! Can't wait to go back! Beverage pairing was on point! Mom was correct can't be desert without chocolate!",

Portions are pretty huge, so be",

We came for Taco Tuesday and loved all of it. The drinks were excellent, the food was delicious, and service was great. We will definitely be back!",

Brian and Mikey have done a fantastic job building a staff of friendly front of house and a menu with staples and rotating dishes. I highly, highly recommend this restaurant to everyone in Nashville!!",

   "Went to celebrate Valentine's Day. Such a great dinner. The brussel sprouts as an appetizer were a great start. The pork schnitzel was AMAZING and I can't wait to go back to get it again! Seriously one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The chocolate cake had this nice crispy crust to it that kind  of made it a cross between a cake and brownie. So good. We also moved mid meal  (at our suggestion) to accommodate a larger party next to us. The manager brought us glasses of champagne as a thank you which was a great way to toast to a fantastic date night."

The veggies, starters, and sides we ordered were all wonderful but sadly both of our meat dishes were overcooked and the flavor wasn\u2019t outstanding.

Also had a delicious cheese and chocolate plate which was divine.",

   "This was an EXCELLENT experience! The food just kept getting better and better with every dish they brought. I'm a vegetarian so we only ate off the left side of the menu, but it was very filling and so tasty. I don't think anything was bad at all. Titus was of server and he was very attentive and was on the spot everyone we needed anything. The atmosphere was great and there is a real missed vice inside and kinda of laid back. They also have an excellent drink menu is that is your thing."

Not one person from our group had a single complaint. The prices were reasonable, the portion sizes were perfect. Ordered a drink from the bar, it came out quick, well made and not overpriced. It\u2019s short walk from the convention center. I would highly recommend to anyone in the area.",

Famous Dave's used to be my favorite BBQ place, but Martin's ribs are so much better. Their deviled eggs, baked beans, and wings are really great, too. I definitely left a very happy trucker!",
   "This place is GREAT. We got the big mama's platter which had brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and a couple sides. We also got wings. It was enough to feed 4 hungry women. Our bartender gave us some suggestions on what to order and which sauces to get and she was spot-on. Everything was moist, flavorful, and delicious. We then went upstairs and listened to a band in their backyard garden space. It's a great spot for a casual hangout. Would return 100%.",

I've loved every experience I've had here, from when I was formerly on the business to business side selling to Liz and Hrant and as an East Nashville community member who loves elegant dishes with exciting flavor enjoyed in a thoughtfully designed, community restaurant/bar on a mission to showcase flavors from Eastern Europe and the Middle East using Southeast regionally-sourced ingredients! Not to mention the wine selection is consistently intriguing. I'm not sure if there is any other spot in Nashville offering Bulgarian, Turkish or Lebanese wines on the same menu with beautifully curated selections from France, Spain, Italy and United States? Their draft beer is local, and their cocktails offer a unique twist with balanced flavors that mirror the philosophy of the food menu. They're always playing great music, and the menu pricing offers amazing value considering the level of quality of food and beverage.",
   "Good restaurant,  good service. We tried the kibee and the cauliflower.. kibee was good, missed a lime to add some flavour. Cauliflower was too sweet for my taste.",

Their hummus and pita is a game changer, their cocktails are always wonderful, and their rack of lamb is unreal. I love Lyra so very much and I am so glad Nashville has this gem."

   "Great place to dine while in Nashville. I locally sourced restaurants and this place did really good. Homey atmosphere and great chearful staff. The chicken was well prepared and very moist. I loved the turnips and was wanting more. Very good portions. I think the $31 price was a little high for half a chicken but it was a hearty and filling dish. The deviled eggs were simple with a mustard base (I'm partial to mayo) but were still tasty. At $8 for 5 eggs though I was hoping for a little more flavor WOW. I would recommend this place as it's a great example of evolving seasonality type menus and supports local producers.",

We did come in right before close, so the food could have been a little bit better but the service more than made up for it. The margaritas were very good. They use their own in house juice for the margarita mix. I would definitely recommend this place.",
   "This was my first time eating there and I have to say I was impressed. It is open sitting on the first and third floors (third floor is roof top). The tacos are regular sized soft shells but they stuff them very full. The ground beef is seasoned well. Nice atmosphere.",
   "Great street tacos. Highly recommend the chicken. Service was friendly too."

   "The food is amazing. We ordered takeout tonight and you guys killed it. We just parked and food came in less then a minute. They gave us all the sauces, utensils, and ketchup. The best takeout experience ever. Thank you for your attention to detail,  Kellen! 5 star service!",
   "Always love eating here when I'm visiting. Of all the chicken places, this is the fastest and the most consistent in quality. The sandwich is delicious and massive. The heat levels have plenty to offer for everyone. Their mac and cheese is great and helps cool down your tongue while you're sweating. Still crossing my fingers they open a location in Knoxville!",
   "AWESOME chicken and great sides!  I visited once 4 years ago and was an immediate believer!  I'm in town for 4 days and have already eaten there the first two.  Don't be scared off by a line out the door... they're efficient at getting people through.  It's totally worth a wait.  Only Negative... They haven't yet opened a DC location!!!  Come to Northern VA PLEASE!!!",
   "Hot, fast chicken! Service is excellent. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Don't worry... The line that leads down the side of the building is very deceptive. It moves fast and customers rotate quickly out to make room for more. If you are weak like me, get the lowest heat possible. My husband liked the hottest level but I don't enjoy tears or sweat in my food even if it's my own. Oh, and get the mac n cheese!",
   "So.good. I got the chicken breast, hot with black eyed pea salad and red skin potato salad. The salads were super fresh and the chicken was PERFECT! So juicy and the seasoning was amazing! The hot was the perfect level of heat and still very tasty! Would go back again and recommend to anyone!"

This is a great spot for a date or a long night out to really have a dining experience. And when I say the food was delicious, all of it was! The appetizers, main course, and dessert! Perfect evening, I will definitely return. Oh, also they have quality old fashions here (no cherry, they use one good ice ball, not tons of ice cubes like amateurs).",

I was impressed with the menu - not too much but still a lot of variety. Overall very pleased with the service and the food. I will definitely be coming back for dinner service.",

   "Very popular place with nice seating, large eat-at bar, and great atmosphere. Good service and delicious food. I had spicy shrimp sushi which was packed with tasty ingredients. Also had an Old Fashioned which was very good! Reservations recommended since it was really crowded.",
   "I am not a big fan of paying a whole lot for food. Four of us went to ready there and my meal with scrambled egg whites was bland. It was also the least appealing of the meals served. There was a good portion of it which was nice, however, that doesn't really make up for overpriced bland food that could easily have been seasoned better."

I\u2019ll definitely be back to take the wife on another date. Great scene. Make a reservation though.",

As a side note, if you want to make someone extremely happy, send them a gift card from 5th & Taylor. It will make you a hit! I promise.",
   "Wow. Awesome atmosphere, excellent service, tasty vittles. Each dish had it's own character, with surprising bursts of flavor scattered throughout. The duck wings were really special with a slightly sweet tang. Even the mashed potatoes were marvelous, with a creamy butteriness that was ever so smooth. Highly recommended."

   "Outstanding food and service. Interesting, unique flavors. It was a slow Tuesday night but it seemed like every staff member came to our table and checked on us at some point. The coffee rubbed carrot appetizer was great. The potato fritters were unlike anything I\u2019ve ever had. And the pork with parsley was so moist and fresh. We were blown away. I loved watching the chef remove a slice of chess pie out of the oven, rather than a microwave. It\u2019s details like that that make all the difference.",
   "Everything was fantastic. Service was perfectly timed. Food full of wonderfully blended flavors. Awesome culinary experience. Deeply rooted and out on a limb by itself. Highly recommend!",
   "The food was great.  The service was good.  \nOur server Chris was distracted and not very attentive, but the greeter Michael was awesome.  He engaged with us and ensured everything was taken care of in Chris' absence.  He deserves high praise.  \n\nWe were there for East Nashville Restaurant week and the servings were teeny tiny.  I know serving sizes are usually smaller for restaurant week...but this was crazy.  Rabbit stew was literally only 4 tablespoons of stew.  For $18...that's approx $4.50 per spoonful!",
   "Really enjoyed our meal here. We popped in for a late dinner (around 10 pm) and were pleasantly surprised! So many late night spots have great drinks and mediocre food, but Treehouse has great food and drink. The food was interesting, delicious and light enough that we could sample several dishes, and the drinks were tasty and novel. Staff was friendly, and the restaurant is cute. Definitely worth checking out, even if it's not late.",
   "We really like this place because of the atmosphere and especially the drinks. The menu rotates so it isn\u2019t always the same. We had the asparagus, potatoes, & cheese plate. Nothing disappointed! We couldn\u2019t finish it all. The cocktails were really good, didn\u2019t have anything we didn\u2019t like. I highly recommend the cheese plate\u2014 the honeycomb goes really well with all the options. We will absolutely will be going back!"

I will definitely be coming back.",

My brother and I came in from out of town to watch a Houston vs Tennessee football game and this place felt like home \u2764\ufe0f The tacos were exceptional and reasonably priced. The service was wonderful and very friendly. I also really appreciate that they were willing to accommodate certain dietary restrictions without questioning. Our only complaint was the coffee tasted a little weak, but we're very particular about our coffee \u2615",
   "Some of the best tacos in Nashville. The tortillas are out of this world, the house hot sauces are so creative and delicious, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is great. This is a staple in my family for sure. Please go check them out!",

She recommended yummy oysters, fabulous wine and even helped me to decide between 2 entrees. A great waitress, great good and great wine! We have eaten here many times but this was by far the most fun I have ever had and will always be my most remembered! Oh yeah, pick up some of the yummy ketchup they have for sale, while you are there!",
   "Wow. I was extremely impressed by this place. Outstanding food, the oysters are among the freshest in town with a variety available. There is a happy hour special where you can get a dozen for $20 between 3pm-6pm. The smoked eggs were delicious and arrived in moments.\n\nThe Southern burger was seriously one of the best in town. Great bacon, juicy burger, tasty crispy straws, and the pimento cheese really set it over the top. \n\nThe service was totally on point. Sat at the bar and they all were friendly, warm, and efficient. Overall layout was easy to navigate, and it had a nice laid back touch among the hustle and bustle of downtown Nashville. A++",
   "The Southern Steak and Oyster restaurant/bar is conveniently located in the heart of music city Nashville! This very popular eatery serves traditional southern dishes, as well as a wide variety of other breakfast, brunch and dinner dishes, and a huge oyster menu! Gluten options are offered as well! The prices on food and drinks are moderate, and the service friendly and prompt! Private meeting rooms are available upon advanced reservations! This landmark restaurant is a must to visit!",
   "Exceptional!!!  Great atmosphere and very attentive service by the staff.  The Oysters and Gumbo were both excellent starters and my Wind from the South salmon was fabulous.  Those in our party of 8 that had steak raved about how good it was.  We were all so full that none of us ordered dessert so cannot testify about that part of the menu but have to believe they are delicious if they are anything like the rest of our meal.  The bar selections are awesome so you can get pretty much anything you want from the full wall of bottles.  Great atmosphere, great service, & great food....just can't say enough good things about The Southern but can highly recommend it!!",
   "My wife and I came here for dinner on our vacation. We ordered the hot chicken salad, dry aged steak, and a dozen oysters. The kitchen lost our ticket, which the waiter admitted to, and said we'd be \"compensated\" for our wait and apologized that he hadn't brought out the biscuits yet. The biscuits never came, he must have forgotten about them. The manager came by and hand delivered our oysters and brought out a complementary side salad we didn't ask for. \n\nEverything was good up to this point, although, my wife didn't want a side salad since she ordered a salad for dinner. The hot chicken salad she had was incredibly spicy, too spicy for the average person. The dry aged steak was fatty and undercooked. At the end of the night, we got the bill and when we looked to see what our \"compensation\" was, nothing was taken off the bill. The side salad we didn't ask for was our \"compensation.\" There was no explanation from the waiter, no final apology for our long wait for the food, no acknowledgement that we were inconvenienced. \n\nIt gets a star for good drinks and atmosphere, but we were unhappy with our food and service experience."

Easily our favorite dinner during our vacation in Nashville.",

The wagyu filet was melt in your mouth delicious with an affordable price at around $60. There is a dress code so while you are enjoying dinner you don't have to see people walking by in shorts or hats. The service, food, and atmosphere makes the price of dining well worth it."

We had a variety of southern comfort foods including fried chicken, corn pudding, cheesy grits, biscuits, cinnamon rolls, scrambled eggs, pancakes and many other delicious treats. Felt more like a local spot which we enjoyed. Food was great and is served family style. I usually do not enjoy this style but it was excellent and a great experience!

   "This was our first visit to Black Rabbit & we both LOVED it. This place has a great vibe, great live music, & incredibly skilled bartenders/mixologists. We typically stick with our regular drinks, but we branched out & tried 4 different drinks while there, 2 of which were on their cocktail menu, & two of which we asked for them to invent right there in front of us after they asked what we liked & didn't enjoy tasting. It was so very impressive! I am quite choosy about my spirits & the folks their simply know what they're doing & they were absolutely killing it with their skills & their imagination. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we're already planning on going back in a few weeks. \n Unfortunately,  we did not eat there, since we had just visited there right after having dinner. We definitely will eat there next time b/c the rabbit rolls that my bar neighbor had looked & smelled outstanding. He kindly offered to give me a bite, but I was already stuffed from dinner. Next time,  I am going in hungry.",
   "Black Rabbit is always an awesome choice you will not be disappointed. Great place to meet coworkers after work and get buzzed on a Tuesday or a wonderful choice for dinner before a Printer's Alley burlesque show on a Saturday night like we did. The ambiance is great. The food and service are comforting and professional. Thank you for always providing a great experience",

   "Wonderfully cozy and intimate atmosphere off the beaten path of downtown. I loved the fireplace and the variety of seating options. There's seating available right by the stage - up close and personal. The live band on Saturday night was delightful. I didn't find the music too loud in this establishment as some reviewers mentioned. It's hard to converse while any band is playing live anywhere so it is to be expected. I will return again.",
   "Just to preface this, I went here as part of a corporate event so it's possible we didn't get the full experience. \n\nThat said, the decorations were interesting (frosted stripper mirror and top hat hanging lights) and the space was cozy. Comfortable couches, fireplace, lots of tables and standing areas near the bar.\n\nFood wise, I just wasn't impressed. The only thing I had that was above average was a slice of sour dough bread buttered with some flake salt. It was quite good. \n\nThe corn tostada had some hummus that had some zing not not really any taste I would go back for. The tortilla wraps had a pulled pork and shredded beef that was relatively bland even with hot sauce. Dessert was a slice of citrus pound cake. It had a decent glaze but still nothing to write home about. \n\nIf you're in the area and want a darker, upscale but cozy vibe with some friends, this might be a good spot for you. If you're just looking for good food, there is so much in the area, this probably won't be at the top of your list."

We stopped in just for drinks, but decided to have lunch after being tempted by the sushi on the second floor. They have a nice craft beer selection.

We were grateful that the second level was not nearly so busy. Would be a great place to come out for a party.",

   "Acme Feed & Seed is a great restaurant! I really enjoyed the live music; instead of just a typical loud country cover band, they had a really cool string band performing. Very good atmosphere, not too many drunk people in there (which is rare for Broadway!) and the food was simple but still great.",
   "Fantastic place, food was really good and service was great. they went above and beyond to take care of us even though they were super busy. Band was really good and we enjoyed their set. Second floor was a chilled jazz lounge and then we went on the roof for a great view of the river and the lights wonderful place."

   "Great for celebrations!\n\nMelting pot totally exceeded my expectations. We visited the Nashville location for a friend\u2019s birthday, and I was blown away! The fondue broth for the meats & veggies was tasty and there was well enough food for everyone. The desert fondue flamb\u00e9 blew my mind & was so rich as well!! Service was fast & funny, I really appreciated the waiter\u2019s suggestions about the area when he found out we were visiting from out of town. \n\nIt was a super smooth & memorable dinner, I\u2019ll definitely be back!",
   "The food, the atmosphere were excellent. Made even more so by server Michelle. She took the time to explain the various choices, made great recommendations and was totally attentive to our every need. We cannot say enough how happy we are with our choice to dine at The Melting Pot. This is a place for a special dinner when you're not in a hurry. It is a wonderful experience! Lacy took care of us so well and was able to answer all our questions and make helpful recommendations.",
   "Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We tried the grilled option for the first time for the main course and we loved it. We will order it again the next time we go! I ordered my favorite dessert fondue, the bananas foster, have had it before. The food, the atmosphere were excellent.  We definitely left full and satisfied.",

   "This was a wonderful experience. The waiter was professional, talkitive, enjoyed helping us learn the ways of the dinner. The food was AMAZING. Cheese fondue was awesome, salad was very good, and dinner was great. We especially liked the different sauces they give you to dip your meats in. Dessert was delicious as well, with lots of choices of things to dip in the chocolate you choose."

   "If I could give Byron & team 10 stars, I would!\n\nMy husband & I were in Nashville for our 4 year wedding anniversary. Side note: we did eat at a different location that, at the time of the reservation, we did share that it was our anniversary trip. This establishment did not acknowledge it at all. However, we chose Trattoria Il Mulino for our actual anniversary dinner and BOY did they deliver!\n\nThe space itself is beautiful, a bit darker, and more intimate but the service for the whole night was, in a word, exceptional. We knew we chose right when we were seated & found a hand-written card wishing us a Happy Anniversary & signed by the entire staff! Our server Byron was so charming, attentive, and humorous as were the other staff members who took care of us. The food was also fantastic (try the ricotta meatballs!) and as if the date could not get any better, Byron told my husband of a shortcut from the restaurant (through the glass doors by the bathroom) through the Hilton right next door, to the street, to the pedestrian bridge for a romantic walk and dance on the bridge by night. \n\nMy husband & I managed to have a *perfect date* and Trattoria Il Mulino, with it's wonderful service, food, & ambiance helped make it so. Thank you Byron & everyone working 7/24/2019--we look forward to seeing you again!",
   "The food was amazing!!!! The service was great and I really enjoyed the complimentary appetizer spread with fresh bread. You really feel welcome and are able to enjoy the evening. It's near all the action but yet just far enough away that you heat the for traffic. Must add the bathrooms are extremely clean (",
   "Wonderful meals!! Amazing allergy friendly options and the service was THE BEST and everyone was very polite! I ordered gluten free pasta (as shown below) and would highly recommend this dish to anyone, even without allergies. They also had plenty of options for another family member who is dairy and nut free. Overall one of the best restaurants I have ever been to!",
   "Outstanding restaurant.  The ambience is nice like others.  It is the service and the food that sets this restaurant above others.  The managers and servers work together making this restaurant exceptional.  Pasta is made on in the restaurant.  I highly recommend the lobster over pasta.  Wine selection is impressive with floor to ceiling wine rack as pictured.  Prices are appropriate to the quality of the food.  Try it.  We celebrated our anniversary and they gave us a nice card.",
   "Went on for a company dinner. Great options for vegetarians.  Descent cocktails, and good wine. The atmosphere is nice as well. Not sure if the prices, so make sure to check in advance."
