   "Beautiful zoo and conservatory. They have a great and varied collection of animals. Nice indoor areas, as well. The Conservatory took my breath away. Nice to see so much green after all the snow outside.",
   "Nice day out, beautiful  conservatory and plants. Also for just a small donation you can visit the zoo  - well worth  a visit and very interesting and knowledgeable staff. Would definitely recommend if in the area.",
   "Great place to take the Family without breaking the bank. We have a one year old that loves looking at the animals. For a donation only zoo it's more than I expected. Clean and well laid out.",
   "Como is a Twin Cities treasure. An awesome (FREE!) activity any time of year, with lots of animal exhibits outdoors in the summer, and the conservatory offering a tropical escape into lush greenery and warmth even on the coldest snowy days in winter. The unexpected sloth hanging out in the tropical bird conservatory is one of my favorite spots to visit. The bonsai tree has an open section in winter, expanded in summer with a Japanese garden outside as well. Como is great for whole families, a date, catching up with friends , or getting your grandparents out for the day. Also a great spot for photo sessions; saw one today for a quincea\u00f1era!",
   "It is a smaller zoo, but a great way to spend an hour or so.  It was cold when I last went here, so I did not have much interaction with staff.  There were a couple spaces under construction as well.  It is definitely a family-friendly place.  I highly recommend taking your kids here if you do not want to chaos or expense of the state zoo."

   "My GREAT GREAT GRANDPARENTS WERE MARRIED HERE IN 1920....\nNot to mention you can go in anytime just to experience the beauty and complete awesomeness of a place of worship. I truly feel like one of God's children when I am here\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udc96",
   "Truly beautiful, yet not excessive. The sound system is excellent (difficult to accomplish in such a massive space). The parish community and priest are absolutely centered on Christ and His gospel.\n\nNot particularly strong on handicap accessibility.",
   "A majestic, ornate and classically domed cathedral, strikingly visible on the Saint Paul skyline, impressively massive by day and highlighted with breathtaking lights by night. The altar, with its elaborate sculpted bronze canopy, is reminiscent of the altar in Saint Peter's Basilica in the Vatican  On the highest hilltop overlooking Minnesota's Capitol city, it was 51 years from start of construction to consecration. In spite of its huge dome and vast size, acoustics are excellent for worship services and the Gallery organ marvelously fills the monumental space.",
   "Went for \u00e0 walk with a friend on Selby and decided to head towards the direction of the Cathedral. We were having some deep discussions on the nature of religion and the importance (or lack of) in modern day child rearing. We also discussed our childhood days and the impact Catholicism had on our lives and who we are today. As we passed the Rectory, we came to a stop but our discussion kept going until slowly we both were just taking in this magnificent structure. We stood in silence looking at the arches, the Heroic size marble statues of the four evangelists, the exterior walls (Rockville granite from Saint Cloud, MN) and, of course, the copper-clad dome (renovated in 2002!) and finally broke silence by having the most eloquent expression known to humanity \"....wow....\" This friend then commented the power of people coming together to build structures to something greater than the individual and creating a Landmark that will be here long after they are gone. This was humbling and empowering. I am proud to live only a few miles away from this magnificent Cathedral and also humbled at the free awe you can glean by just taking a moment to marvel at this beauty. I could use all my breath recommending to take this in but YOU should just go yourself. If you must capture the moment with your little magic rectangle, then do so, but I suggest closing your eyes, breathe deep and then open your eyes focusing on a specific part. Repeat this as many times as needed. You'll feel better, believe me. I sure believe",
   "The cathedral is a beautiful and great place to go to mass. It is a spectacular work of art and I would recommend it to anyone. Christian or not. It is a beautiful tourist attraction as well."

   "Such a beautiful Capitol! This reminds me a lot of the Texas State Capitol, similar artwork and architecture. There really isn\u2019t much to see inside of a Capitol but to be able to walk through and take in the beauty of a building is worth it. The marble stairs are absolutely gorgeous. If you are around the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, I highly recommend you check out the Capitol.",
   "Paid parking $2/hr. Beautiful from outside and interior. The thing that I didn\u2019t like that I cant go inside the senate/chambers/court rooms. They were locked and only can see behind the bars.",
   "Beautiful and historical place to visit. Will definitely comeback for a guided tour next time I'm in MN.",
   "The Minnesota State Capitol is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Minnesota, in its capital city of Saint Paul. It houses the Minnesota Senate, Minnesota House of Representatives, the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Governor. The building also includes a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Minnesota Judicial Center.",
   "Took the guided tour here. Very well presented and the building itself with it's giant pillars is a great example of amazing contrition. Tour includes visiting the Minnesota Assembly and Senate (which was in session that day so we could not enter that chamber as it was full at the time). Also houses the Minnesota Supreme Court which was very impressive to see,. Court was not in session on the day of our visit. Also includes the main reception room. Tour is about 45 minutes and includes a lot of Minnesota History very well presented. Many steps to climb to enter the Capitol and grounds surrounding it are very nice."

   "See my awesome review of the Gale Family Library if you want a much too detailed explanation of visiting the library! I didn't go to the museum but the building was nice. The cafe smelled good. Everyone was helpful and nice.",
   "This is a decent museum with a current exhibit on Prince.  I would have appreciated a bit more focus on Minnesota as a world-class technology center in industries such as supercomputers, medical devices, etc.  The CDC 6600, designed by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corp., was introduced in 1964.  It was not only the fastest computer in the world at the time, but it included native floating-point operations, which made it a hard core science machine.  The first wearable external pacemaker was developed in Minnesota (becoming Medtronic) as was the world\u2019s first furnace thermostat (becoming Honeywell).",
   "Wonderful museum! Enjoyable for all ages. Unique exhibits. The Greatest Generation and the Tornado room are our family favorites. Plenty to see and do for kids and adults, better for elementary age kids than toddlers.",
   "Regardless of your age, there's bound to be something of interest for you to learn and explore at the Minnesota History Center. You could easily spend an entire visit looking at the various exhibits. The exhibits are really interactive and involving so they leave an impression of what it was like for people that experienced these events. \n\nThere's a high amount of care and attention to detail to essentially all aspects of the visit: the website clearly details what you need to know, the parking is straightforward, and there's even a free coat check (with lockers available for a quarter).",
   "A must go to place on a cold or rainy day. The range of exhibits are diverse and really hands on and interactive. There wasn\u2019t that many people there the day I went. Overall, we had a fun time exploring the history of Minnesota and trying some of the interactive simulations. This place is great for families or people wanting to learn something new"

   "We had an amazing day as a family. We all had so much fun and were kept busy for 4 1/2 hours and we still could have seen more. The membership is a sweet deal and my husband and I don't know why we waited this long to get one. We will go back soon. By the way, the cafe was good and reasonably priced. I got the vegan salad (only vegan item on the menu) and was pleasantly surprised. It was fresh and loaded with nuts and all kinds of good stuff. The dressing was awesome. Fun, fun, fun day.",
   "Went there back in 2008 and I was just astounded by everything they had. My first museum trip and I was pleased. Went to see the titanic exhibit and I was very very excited I am a huge titanic fan. I loved that my friends and I got to learn how the ship worked and we even got \"boarding passes\" for it just as if we were going on the real thing. It was really really really fun. Hoping I can bring my kid and husband there one day.",
   "This is a great place for a date or to bring kids. Plenty to do and see. Only reason for 4 stars is the cost of the day. It was $20 for parking (although I guess there was a dog show so if you told the attendant you were just going to the museum it was $10) and tickets for me and my 4 year old was $34. On top of that we bought concessions so it was quite a pricey day. \n\nOverall it was a good experience and the staff was helpful.",
   "Had an amazing time at the science museum with my kids. The museum is large and after almost 3 hours had to leave and still didn't do everything! \nParking was fine but expensive. My only complaint is this museum has pretty steep admission prices as compared to similar attractions throughout the twin cities. But its so much fun you forget how much you paid once you get in!",
   "We got there at 10am,  parking garage was nearly full. Fortunately we found a spot, unfortunately we drive a Tahoe and the parking spot was built for a Prius. The wrist bands are made from cardboard, rough on the wrist (especially the kids). I was also asked by a worker to not hold my toddler because they have \u201ca two feet on the ground policy.\u201d Exhibit were fun though! \n\nOverall, Don\u2019t think we will be visiting again. There are many places to go with our kids where policy and facilities bring a positive experience."

   "Went on the 75 minute tour. Purchased tickets for $10 each in advance since some had sold out days before we were to visit. Only parking available is on the street, so we arrived early to get a spot. Beautiful mansion that you get to tour 4 of the 5 floors. Almost all furnishings are original and the mansion is very well maintained. Tour guide was very informative and answered questions. They are very particular about not touching things and leaning against walls and furnishings which is to be expected. You also get to see some behind the scenes areas which is rare in these older homes. We enjoyed the tour and may go back around Christmas when it is decorated.",
   "I know it seems crazy to bring two young kids to an historic mansion but they loved it! They\u2019ve asked to return each year and have an uncanny ability to ask just when I was thinking about it. \n\nThe tour guides have an incredibly deep knowledge and I love the color commentary that they provide about the family and the era. \n\nI\u2019m sure that my favorite space is the kitchen. The idea that Mrs. Hill worked to can jam is one that I can relate to.",
   "A favorite destination for historical tours and also performances--they feature plays, musicals, and concerts through the MNHS in partnership with community performance companies and artists. All of the events and tours I've attended here have been a delight! \n\nLeave plenty of time to park and walk when you visit. And don't touch anything in the house (the docents will remind you quite directly if you forget). \ud83d\ude09",
   "Truly an awe inspiring mansion. It's hard to believe that the man who had this mansion built started out with nothing and built one of the largest fortunes in the United States. He was a true visionary! And his taste was beyond compare.",
   "We saw the play \"Daddy Long Legs\". It was staged in the main entrance at the foot of the grand staircase. The audience (about 40) sat in a circle. Was well done in this beautiful setting. We will  go back for the house tour soon."

There were friendly staff at the visitor table to point me in the right direction for my short visit. I would suggest to start at the basement and work your way around each floor and then move up.  There is something to see in every floor.",
   "We were able to kind of wander the building during the Winter Carnival, very interesting! I have been in the building on many occasions but had never really looked around before. Many rooms are labeled with historical tidbits and the basement has a great historical display with lots of information about the building and some of its infamous visitors. Great space for a gathering or reception.",
   "This place has the BEST gift shop if you're looking for unique (and affordable) gifts!  So I absolutely love the different events that the Landmark Center does, from plays to the Ghost Tour to the Christmas Market.  But I also love their little gift shop!  It's not open as many hours as the building, but I've gotten so many unique gifts there!  Definitely worth checking out!",
   "Quite a bit of history since this was the biggest building in St. Paul at one time in its life. We enjoyed a wedding and reception here last night. Elegance at first a four piece string ensemble for the wedding ceremony and later candlelit tabletops for each table at the reception. Then a social hour on the second floor and then a contemporary band playing 70s and 80s dance music on the dance floor. Very nice",
   "Absolutely stunning wedding venue. The location for nearby churches and hotels can\u2019t be beat, and the staff make the experience of wedding planning less stressful. We worked with Hilari who went above and beyond to meet our special requests, designed an amazing layout to meet the needs of our reception, and was an absolute joy to work with. Love that we could bring in the licensed caterer of our choice to create exactly the menu we wanted. I also have to say the value for the price in the Twin Cities is unbeatable. We comfortably seated 270 guests with room for cocktails and the dance floor."

They had a local brewing company's beer truck on site priced reasonably. The restaurants across the street are delicious, though on a night with a good band you might wait awhile for a table. We sat on a patio at a great place across the street for the opening band then moseyed into the park for some really good local brews and amazing music. We had family come in from out of town a few months back and knew we had to bring them here! Everyone had a perfect night. The park itself is very nice, too, and has art events on top of the music.",

   "A very quaint and nice place. My dog and I walk through often and enjoy walking along the water. If you live on the St Thomas campus, I recommend taking a walk through here because it is just beautiful and a quieter part of campus. There are even benches if you want to study in a quiet place.",
   "Very pretty. A realistic running stream and mini waterfall. Lots of beautiful anual and perennial flowers blooming (July 24). Each garden area has a sign with the name of the person who cares for that section. Lots of space to roam, lots of park benches. Great eateries across the street with beautiful outdoor eating spaces with more plants and trees, with a hip vibe. Lots of fun on a summer afternoon or evening!",

   "We went to see the \"Night Trains.\" Grandma, mom, dad and a 2-year-old. It was fun for all ages. There are so many details to look at and buttons for pushing. We spent about an hour here but easily could have been longer. There are train tables for the little ones to build their own tracks.",
   "Amazing displays, very interactive for all ages and completely kid and toddler friendly! Their Lego display is outstanding, they have 6 train tables for little ones and 3 Thomas trains for kids to become the engineer and run themselves. We will be back!",
   "If you're kid is into trains, this a great place to visit! They have model trains, with buttons to push to make them go. There are also a dozen play tables in the back - think Thomas and Brio - so the younger ones have fun too. It seems to be a gathering spot for local clubs - Legos train group and staff tending to the displays. Family bathroom in the museum, and regular bathrooms in the main building.",
   "OH YES!!!!!!!!\n\nI am a BIG TIME train fanatic! This place is totally worth the tuppence they charge for admission. Great place if you have a soft spot for trains and model trains!\n\nThey have displays of many different gauges and locations. My favorite was the huge layout in the center of the room. This is the first time I spent 4 hours in such a small \"museum\" type location. The detail and interactivity was great. The staff was also great! As much as I shy away from locations with kids, this is a good place to bring children to introduce them to model trains. I couldn't wipe the smile off my face while I was there.\n\nOne last cool thing was that they have model train cars, engines and accessories for sale. I had to stop myself from buying anything as my current lay out is in storage and I cannot add to it until its back up!\n\nI recommend this place. Its in a sleepy, little non descript mall, but well worth the visit for train enthusiast young and old."

   "Great place to go hiking, fishing, bird watching or have a picnic. Great picnic grounds. Fantastic views of the Mississippi River.  Has a  free great boat launch with ample parking for you truck and boat trailer. Nice hiking trail thru heavily forested river bottom lands.",
   "Place was awsome with tons of possibilites. You could do anything from walking to fishing and more. The place has a nice lite man made water fall in a nice quite secluded place which is nice when one wants to enjoy more of nature.",
   "Great beautiful park. Free of charges. Lots of parking spaces. Walking & hiking paths right down on the Mississippi River. Picnic booths & elegant hidden views.",
   "Beautiful spot. Good fishing to be honest but it's probably not a good idea to keep anything from the river unless it's a really good catch. I have been tempted by the idea of catfish nuggets, however.",
   "Neither hidden, nor falling.\nWe found them.\nStill good."

   "It's a beautiful place to know part of the history of Minnesota....No pictures or videos...",
   "The historic tour lasts a little under an hour and allows you to explore all over the whole house, all three levels. What is especially good is that there are different tour hosts in each room of the house so you get many perspectives from folks in period dress who are play-acting that they really live there. When you're in the kitchen, they serve a lovely tray of cookies baked in the wood-burning stove. Our 4 year old granddaughter was interested throughout, but really got excited at the very end when they took us to the playroom and we saw toys from the time. Insights into the lives of the occupants were shared that made it historically memorable. The guide read from letters that were written at Christmastime from the wife to her husband.",
   "A few years ago, I enjoyed a beautiful visit to the Alexander Ramsey House. I picked up the Ramsey family Christmas cookie recipe book. Today I made the Gingerbread Cookies and the flavor was excellent! Don't forget to add the ginger spice as it was omitted in the ingredients. I used 1 tsp of ginger and I baked them on parchment paper. Baking will take longer, depending on the cookie size and shape so watch closely and enjoy. In the pictures you will see my Nantucket Lightship basket that I just finished making.",
   "I went to a Victorian Seance here for Halloween and I think that was the most fun event I\u2019ve ever been to!! Gorgeous manor with stunning furnishings and art- at midnight. 10/10 would recommend.",
   "Victorian Christmas tour was full for weekend.  The start at the visitors center is decked with many seasonal items along with historical books.  No pics allowed in the house itself!  Guides in period dress relate the customs of the time and stories of the Ramsey family.   Nicely appointed with Christmas tree in the parlor, and cookies from the wood burning stove offered to visitors.  Well worth  $12 admission for one hour tour."

Highly recommend bringing a change of dry clothes if you are going to spend any time at the water area in the Sprouts room (3 and under) - they have air dryers but they can only get so much drying done.",
   "This is such a fun and amazing place.  I have presented magic shows here many times and his picture is from the big fun Halloween event they did a few years back.",
   "What can I say but we severely miss the old museum.  We barely ever go now and will probably not renew membership.  The old museum is no comparison to the new one.  So much more to do in the old one.  This one is just ho-hum.  Flashy, but no substance.  Even the craft/create room is a let down.  How about bringing back all the bins of fun stuff to let the kids create???  Sigh...why do all the good things have to go away for the \"new and improved\"  but never better versions.  I guess at least the folks who apparently were never at the old museum seem to love the new one...lucky they have nothing to compare it to.",
   "My husband and I went to the \"Adult Night\" at the museum, and it was one of the most fun experiences I've had in the Twin Cities, and I grew up here!  You get to play with the different experiences, and try new things, and play all the games.  The lines for the beer were a bit long, but honestly, we were playing so much that we didn't feel like we needed to go back for beer.  We just had some when we got home, and enjoyed our time at the museum instead!",
   "Very nice place. We were just there today. Plenty of fun for kids of all ages. The air tubes and ping pong balls were the best. Nice restaurant-toy shop on site. Clean  restrooms, and convenient parking."

Canoe and kayak rentals as well as tandem bikes and buggies. Very nice surrounding neighborhood. Great place to take the kids or even a first date. One of the gems of the twin cities....",
   "Love this park, but especially the Como Conservatory. Gorgeous experiences in many environs. The sights, smells, and sounds are another world. I like it best when the crowds are minimal, and I can experience the solitude I love. Bring drawing materials, sketching is just awesome! The carousel is my favorite...I am seventy and the ride is still such a delight!",
   "My kids love this place. We plan our trips to the zoo after 1PM because there's a good chance that the animals are awake from their naps. Except the cats, those cats do whatever they want. (Dad joke) my favorite exhibit is that of the snow leopard. Such a fascinating animal.",
   "I love the size of Como Park Zoo, it's not tiring to visit with small children but has a good variety of animals. The zoo is clean and easy to get around. The botanical center is lovely especially on cold winter days! And the bonsai collection is fascinating",
   "Donation admission means you can visit free, but the recommended $3 adults/$2 children is low enough that I don't see how anyone could not find that value on a visit. Despite some repairs being needed, a wintertime visit (non-ideal), and some new construction set to resume in spring, it was a worthwhile stop with a toddler. Small enough to cover quickly, and thorough enough to see a variety without needing a stroller."

Half mile train ride nothing much but my kids loved it. Really a nice place to go with little kids as a family. My 2.5 year old loves trains. Workers are super enthusiastic and love what they do. Nice lower stim place to go. Not much for food but there are tables if you wanted to pack lunch. \n\nMaybe the price is slightly steep but without other funding sources I\u2019m sure it is what needs to be charged. I value the museum and will pay for the experience here and there.",

They also love riding the train (outside) as well.  I really enjoy watching the model train set as there is so much detail and items hidden throughout the track.",

   "This park has a lot to offer. Open fields, park benches, Pavilions, a playground, public restroom, even a wonderful scenic view of the city. The burial grounds can also be a great sight if your into it. One complaint I do have however is that there's an ugly tennis court with cracks everywhere, and grass growing all over the court. Compared to the rest of the park it just looks hideous. The city either needs to tear it down or renovate it. Aside from that you got yourself a nice park. This place seems ideal for family picnics, or short strolls.",

   "My three year old loves this place! An amusement park with many rides that little kids can enjoy. You can buy an all-day or all-season pass and let your little thrill seeker go on their favorites over and over. There is also a fun playground with splash pad inside so bring extra clothes or at least a towel. Some rides allow an adult to ride with their kid for free (Bees, bumper cars, tea cups ) My only complaint is the dark, dank restroom on site but at least it's there.",
   "The bathrooms in the main entrance were completely flooded and smelled like urine. We waited in line for a long time for the tiger coaster and they were not astute enough to shut it down while assessing whether it needed repairs so we had multiple times of people waiting in line while they were fixing it. We also had an issue with rude staff giving us a hassle about our tickets. Yes, we bought them a year ago, but they explicitly said \u201cno expiration,\u201d so I\u2019m not sure why they made a big deal out of that. We purchased tickets - what\u2019s the difference as long as we payed to get in? After we got that sorted out, the rest of the park was pretty fun. It would be really great if they had places where younger kids in the 2-4 year age range could play while their older siblings go on rides. This would make it MUCH easier on parents. Also, more clean bathrooms. Did I mention clean bathrooms? Don\u2019t let this post discourage you completely from going to Como Town - we did have a lot of fun there and it\u2019s a nice addition to the zoo. I just want to make you aware of a few shortcomings that were a bit disappointing, especially since we drove almost three hours to get there.",
   "Accommodative activities for all while you enjoy time out with family",
   "Great for kids 8 and under, I would say. (Any older and the kids might get bored because there are very few \"thrilling\" rides). Toddlers/preschoolers will enjoy the many options available to them, including a splash pad and playground! I wish there were more rides, though. You can do everything in a short period of time."

   "While the show participants weren't necessarily Minnesotan at the show I saw, the theme was timely, sensitively produced, varied, well curated. I would have liked a local interest \"story\", if that was included, I missed it. Also, we Googled the museum and each phone came up with different results. The build out is immaculate, but there were stairs to nowhere, I wished the bridge upstairs was utilized in the show. I want to show art here. There was a room for children and young adults, too, where we sat and made zines. Nice. Minnesota Nice!",

The sun was shining and the water was clear so we took off our shoes and waded through the watery trail.  It was like a mini tropical location but in MN :)"

Kids would love this so much since you\u2019ll see some animals on the shores or eagles for them to see. They can learn a little bit about the history, and you can relax as they can\u2019t go too far since you\u2019re on a boat. I highly recommend doing this at least once! Make sure the weather is good. Although for us it was a little hot, the breeze outside felt great, and when it got too hot we came inside and the AC felt great. The outside area though was a bit crowded. Such a great time overall! 8 out of 10 for sure.",

It's relaxing, the staff is awesome, and it's a great way to spend a few hours.  My friend bought season tickets for 2018 and we went several times...loving it....so myself and another friend bought season passes for this year, 2019.  The season pass includes 3 extra passes so we've been able to invite others along and we've had great fun!!  We've met a variety of interesting and nice people on the boat.  Along with your purchase of a season pass, you get two passes for one specialty cruise..such a great deal.!!!  I hope to do the season passes for 2020 as well..!!!  THANK YOU Padelford Riverboats!!

Definitely recommend a visit if you're looking to kill some time before a flight.    Just note the signage isn't that good for finding it.   Best way in is to park in the hotel parking lot top level then enter through the glass doors then up the stairs one level which can be found beyond the pool",

Very close to MSP so doable during a long layover as well.",

I wouldn't have rated this place if I was shown a little respect and they took a little responsibility and apologized for there mistake. I will never recomend or go there again. Staff was rude."

   "Visited with wife and 17 yr old daughter. We all thought it was great. It was STEM day so perhaps there was a bit more going on than normal, but for $30 total, it was well worth the 2.5 hours. Minneapolis movie is well done. Flour tower is extremely well done and observation deck is great (exterior closed in winter). We all felt it was well worth our time. Highly recommended.",
   "A great historical and interactive museum for all ages. My 5 and 3 year old love going. The elevator tour is really cool. And the view from the top is great. Good for short visits 1 1/2 hours - to longer 3 - 4 hour visits. Free entry with history museum membership.",
   "Really cool museum! The views are crazy cool from the observation deck and there is some great history about the cities and how things came to be! If you like museums and have a spare hour I recommend checking it out, and then walking next door to the Guthrie for a fantastic show.",
   "I was very pleasantly surprised by this place! I had heard good things from my daughter who attended a field trip here, but found it to be even more interesting than she described it. The staff were all very knowledgeable and engaging. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't been.",
   "This place is so cool, I used to come here as a kid all the time for school field trips. I\u2019ve since come here in recent years and it\u2019s all still so fascinating to see how a different era of Minneapolis worked. To see a what this thriving industry was once like. If you\u2019re looking for a cool day trip, this is worth it."

   "Interesting and unique. It's not large at all (very much a small downtown park.) Basically, it is much like the other riverside parks along the pedestrian trail that follows the river, except for the mill. Still, because of the mill, it's very scenic - a neat spot to stop by if you're in the area.",
   "A nice place along the river banks. Many things to do in the area and bridge crossings to connect you to the north side of the river for even more options of activities and dining. Plus some great views of the city and the old ruins that make a large part of the cities history.",
   "Love Mill Ruins Park! Combines the history of Minneapolis with present day. Mill Ruins Park is part of the Central Mississippi Riverfront Regional Park. Living in Minneapolis is the best. So much to see and do.",
   "History is great, but the train and tracks inside the building are cool. Has a nice cafe that's kind of hidden, and nice little gift shop with Minnesota/Minneapolis local types of interesting finds. Also near the farmers market!",
   "There is a protected bike lane covering the entire loop. Seeing the history of the flour milling industry and how it shaped the city of Minneapolis and the Mississippi River is pretty cool. The signage for pillsbury and gold medal flour is maintained and lights up at night. If this is your first trip to the twin cities I'd recommend the loop in warmer weather or bundle up. The paths are well maintained and there are informational plaques the entire way."

   "Cute park that is great for smaller toddlers. Lots of small children for my son to play with. In a good area with lots of toy trucks in the sand pit. Only thing I didn't like were people allowing their dogs to be off leashes but they didn't bother us.",
   "I love this park, it\u2019s nice and protected from the sun and there\u2019s a bunch of sand toys there for communal use. Huge thank you to whoever contributed them!!",
   "This park has it all, several grilling areas and picnic spots for families. Also plenty of open grass, so bring a blanket or two to sit down on.  There's also a rather large kid friendly park with the rubber floor so falls don't hurt, plenty of good activities for kids on the park and lots of seating spots to supervise at. Theres also a 3ft wading pool, beware that there is no life guard on duty, but this is a great place to bring the little ones on a hot summer day. There are also fields and courts for sports here.

The facilities such as food services, alcohol, refreshments, and restrooms were clean and refreshing.  The lines were long and I opted out of some services over others, but that comes with the crowds.  The stadium offered sound dampening apparel, which I found very important for the experience.  The security check to enter the facility was quick and stress free.  I felt very safe during my experience.",
   "Took my 2 yr old son here for the packers game on Dec 23rd. It was awesome and he only lasted til halftime which was fine. The private suites we were up in seemed to start off with a bang on the food layout then gradually got worse through the rest of the game. Not everyone is drinking and cant taste good food. I expect better if Im paying for prime tickets, not something I would get if I walked to a food stand out of reg seats.",
   "My first time to U.S. Bank Stadium was for Monster Jam. We were 2 rows from the ceiling! The sound was good, the view was good even though it was far away. The facilities are very clean. Getting around was easy. Even though we were at the top, there were escalators to help make the trip bearable. There were plenty of vendors there, but even more that weren't open. I imagine they're for sporting events. The size of this place is amazing!",
   "Super noisy. Can't expect anything other than noise. But the Twins have a great open air stadium. Very family oriented, in my opinion. Easily accessible by Metro Transit.",
   "Amazing stadium and if you\u2019re lucky enough to get a suite the offering of food and drink is great. The concourses are wide and there is t a bad view In the house. Plenty of bathrooms. Only thing that could be better would be more parking options nearer to the stadium."

   "This is an enjoyable experience with a good variety of species to see. The underwater tunnel is a great walk through and you could spend a lot of time there. I'd suggest finding out when they're least likely to be busy, as it's better with uncrowded walkways and without a lot of kids making noise. Would be nice to have a full touch tank experience with some fish or rays and adding an octopus exhibit would be an improvement.",
   "A decent Aquarium, I have enjoyed the place. There are many different varieties of fish and other sea species considering the size of the place you will find a wide range of sea life.If you compare it to Shedd or GA aquarium it sure seems pretty small but considering the space its in I thought it was good. We spent around 3hrs and it was fun. On a winter day this would be a perfect spot to spend a few hours with family. Kids will sure enjoy the place. There are a couple of spots where you can touch the fish which is cool and kids would enjoy it. The price isn't that bad either.",
   "I'm just here in Minneapolis for work and I went to the Mall of America out of curiosity. It's a really well done aquarium. You walk down a hallway with amphibians and reptiles with scheduled guides. This leads to a 300 ft long tunnel with surgeons, shark, guitar sawtooth rays. This is the highlight although the jellyfish exhibit is a close second. The end has the shallow pools with sting rays and crustaceans you can feed. Definitely worth it for the tunnel",
   "Interesting place, especially if you add the behind the scenes tour.  Though it's a small aquarium,  they do a great job of maximizing the various environments. In addition to the aquarium,  there are rain forest, jellyfish, coral, and stingray exhibits. \n\nThe best deal is a membership if you're local and plan to go more than once a year. I was visiting from out of town and decided to go just to for  something different to do.",
   "This place needs more organized lines and/or better trained staff. We purchased the wristband package with Sea Life included. When we went down to the sea life level, there was a long line to buy tickets and another line to get in. A woman was directing everyone to the ticket line.\n\nWe informed her that we already had the wristband package and she said we still had to wait in the first line. Fast forward 30-45 min later and an employee told people ahead of us that if they already had tickets they can proceed to the other long line to get in. I double checked with her about our wristbands and she said we also could have skipped this first line. If I hadn't checked with her it could have easily been another 30 minutes. The staff is friendly, and I understand this is a busy place, but it was a frustrating experience.\n\nAs for the experience itself, it also seems like one big line. You walk single file through most of the exhibit which is lack luster for the most part. The aquarium tunnels toward the end are pretty cool, but that's about it. This place kills a pretty good portion of your day, so unless you really enjoy fish, I would say skip it."

It was a very beautiful place. Definitely going here again.",

The selected plays are always worth a watch. Easy parking in front of building and special pricing for rush club members.\n\nThey also have a awesome lookout balcony which has almost 360\u2022 view of stone arch area. A must watch during summer and fall.",

Every exhibit is placed specifically and maps are given when you walk in. With both coat check, maps, and helpful workers you can find any exhibit you want. You can also just browse and spend hours experiencing world class art. My favorite floor is the top one, where a painting hangs that is absolutely massive. It is modern and features two young men. Not sure if it is still there, as the museum keeps exhibits fresh and exciting. Spend some time at the cafe and sip on some coffee. There are more activities and rooms than just the museum itself. It is a wonderful way to spend the morning, afternoon, or evening.",
   "This place deserves some hype. I've been there countless times on school field trips, or weekend outings with friends and family. I love the atmosphere as it doesn't feel stuffy or plain. It is full of life and really immerses you in different cultures. There are some exhibits I remember seeing over and over again, but each time I return I encounter something new. It is always clean and well organized, and I've never seen it be uncomfortably busy, even on the weekends. The rotating exclusive exhibits are always beautiful and informative, but even if you stick to just the free areas there is plenty to see. Free admission is truly a blessing, so donate if you can! This is a fantastic art museum.",
   "We attended a dinner here on a Saturday night. It was a really fun atmosphere. Food was good. We did a scavenger hunt in the galleries looking for close up sections found in different pictures or exhibits. It was a good mixer and helped us look at the artwork again in new ways. Some things could only be seen up close while it took a far away perspective in order to \"see\" others.",
   "It's an amazing Museum! I love that they display contemporary and historical art. They also have a Family Day once a month that provides a lot of great activities for kids! And, you can never go wrong seeing a show there at the Children's Theatre Company!",
   "This is one of those cultural gems of Minneapolis you may not have heard of, but that you MUST go experience. I can\u2019t believe this place does not charge admission! The art is world-class (I saw Picasso\u2019s and Monet\u2019s!) and there will always be something intriguing for you to see. The space is gorgeous and the docents are incredibly helpful.

I like the willow trees that surround it. Occasionally the serenity and peace is ruined by the sound of large airplanes going overhead back to the airport. When it's not flooded, it's much easier to navigate.",
   "nicely laid out, lots of parking and clearly marked signage everywhere. There's a separate bike path than foot path, and lots of recreational activities including biking and kayaking, with both available for rental. lots of families everywhere, people were putting up hammocks between the many trees and falling asleep in them. There is food available to purchase, big place to sit and eat and enjoy the view of the lake.",
   "Nice dog walking around lake, best during wekday less cycles on another pathway",
   "We love to walk around it or bike around it. Besutiful all year round. Great to see sunsets over the water, or people watch."

   "We were visiting the mall of America and decided to try this attraction and we had an incredible experience! I took my 8 and 10 year old boys and they had a blast. The skill level was fun and interesting for all of us and I was impressed by how innovative the room was. It wasn\u2019t easy but it wasn\u2019t too hard to make it frustrating or difficult! They helped us out with clues when we needed it and even let us stay for a little extra time to finish \u201cescape\u201d the room since we couldn\u2019t do it in the hour time frame. I really appreciated the friendliness of the staff and their ability to give us a great experience!",
   "Nice Escape Room experience located in the Mall of America.\nThe prices here are more expensive than some other operators in the area, but I suppose that's to be expected in the MOA.\nThe staff were all friendly and helpful before, during, and after our mission.\nWe went through their Prison Escape mission and got out with over 2 minutes remaining!\nDefinitely a fun way to spend an hour for an experience you'll be talking about long after!",
   "Would defiantly recommend The Escape Game for a fun thing to do with your family or friends. I had a lot of fun solving \"The Heist\" game. I love a good challenge and this room provided exactly that . Our game guide was Sarah and she did an amazing job. She was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all of my questions.  If you're looking for something fun to do in the Mall of America, be sure to check this place out.",
   "We have enjoyed each game played here. The staff members are awesome and supportive. We have played 4 games with just two of us and escaped from 3. I highly recommend Gold Rush if it's your first game ever as it was for us. Definitely make sure you take advantage of their discounts at the end because you will want to come back! I can't wait to try the one we didn't escape from (The Heist) again and make an attempt at Prison Break!",
   "So much fun. The staff is very helpful, and it's quite necessary that they are. It's a busy sign in area prime time on the weekend. \nWe had a group of 8 and we did the heist room. It was very well thought out and so much fun to navigate together. We escaped with 7 minutes left and used about 4 clues. \nWould recommend doing with friends and family for any occasion. Check for Groupons."

   "Beautiful Basilica.  Would recommend getting a guide which can be picked up at the front of the Church for a 2 dollar donation.  Highlights for me were the stained glass, the organ, and the altar area.  Also, there are different types of nativity scenes set up throughout the Church.   There is parking in the back, and plan to spend 30 minutes to see everything.",
   "They are so friendly and generous with how they provide support for low income and homeless individuals. It was great to see the empathy they exhibited towards the guests in need while at the Shoe Ministry. This was a great day for the people I brought to get shoe vouchers, they walked out of there with much more than they could've imagined.",
   "The Basilica of Saint Mary is a beautiful old church. It is well maintained a still an active site of worship. The church has an ornate ceiling and amazing stained glass windows. It is quiet and peaceful upon entering.  If you walk all the way to the back of the Church, you can see the large pipe organ, which extends most of the height of the wall with angel statues around it. It is well worth seeing. The amount of care and detail in everything is wonderful to see.",
   "The home of a vibrant congregation, with a mission of outreach to the community, the Basilica of St. Mary is a place to visit, if not arrange a docent-led tour. With an important history locally and nationally, the church building tells its witness to Mary in its gorgeous stained-glass windows in the two-story nave. The church is filled with iconography on every door panel and wall niche. Furthermore, the church has international worship manifestations, from Our Lady of Guadalupe to a Madonna and Child from Vietnam. This is a church you will want to visit more than once.",
   "There is a lot of beauty inside this place. It draws a big crowd,so maybe we shouldn't have been so surprised to see a number of police securing the entrances. Good close parking across from it."

   "So fun! Very similar to the Soarin' ride at Disney World, but no 'scents' in the air. We had a fun time here with our son. I think it was about 10 minutes (give or take) long and the line was short to get in. It's a separate thing from the Nickelodeon Universe, but right next to it. \n\nTip: Sign up for their e-newsletter for occasional deals!",
   "Buy ticket stand in a line.  Move to another room and stand in a different line. They lead you into another room and you stand in a line.  Then someone brings you up a level and you sit down and strap into your seat.  It goes dark and you can tell the seat is moving.  Lights come on and your seat is over the walkway that you walked towards your seat.  Flying across America with wind and mist in your face.  It was awesome!  I glanced over and watched the other spectators seats swaying back and forth.  Well worth the 3 different lines I stood in.  AWESOME.  \n\nOh, no pics are allowed inside as I bet you would lose your camera.  lol",
   "If you are in Minneapolis and visiting the Mall of America, you got to be at this place! We have been here twice and this place will never cease to amaze us even if we are going to visit this 10 more times.\n\nThe check in process is quite simple at the front desk and make sure to look for online discount coupons. The staff direct people well inside the premises and are very helpful.\n\nComing to the experience, it is SURREAL! Nothing like I have ever experienced before. It\u2019s a fairly 10 minute simulated flying experience over some of the famous landmarks and landscapes of the USA and ends at outside of the earth. The fantastic background music just ups the entire feel of the whole experience!\n\nThe best part is the mist u feel on your face as you fly over water bodies and the sweet fragrance as you fly over some prairies. The fighter jets that fly in tandem provide an unbelievable view.",
   "Was a cool experience. Only giving it 4 stars as the attraction itself is very short. I recommend getting both the Fly Over Hawaii and America package, as they were both interesting. The attraction itself is very interactive with wind, movement, mist, and smells.",
   "I've taken the kids to Disney world and Disneyland several times, and this rates right up there with my all time favorite attractions! My 21 year old daughter, and my 4 & 7 year old grandchildren absolutely loved it as well - so much that they chose this over the theme park on our second day visit to Mall of America. If you haven't had the opportunity to go on this attraction yet, I hope you'll plan a visit - it was fantastic!"

It was fun to use Google Translate and the camera to translate the Russian. A smaller place with 3 floors right off 35 and Diamond Lake road. Staff was friendly. Free on-street parking. I'd definitely go back!",
   "We have visited here several times and enjoyed every visit. This time we participated in a docent led visit. It was excellent. We particularly enjoyed the exhibits of the Russian Posters, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster photos, and the art on loan from the Hill Monastic Library at St. john's University.",
   "This place is a hidden gem of a museum. I've driven past it hundreds of times and never thought about it until one evening when I thought of dropping by.\n\nThe propaganda posters are amazing. You can easily see the mindset of Russia sitting the Cold War era.\nDown stairs is the old Russia of the tzar's. They have some amazing pieces that were presents to them, or from them. Wonderful craftsmanship. \n\nI was told that the displays change several times a year, which will bring me back in a few months to see what's there.\nGo check it out and support your local museums!",
   "Fantastic place for those with ties to, or interested in, Russian culture. Art galleries are always well curated, displaying both historic and modern Russian art pieces. Additionally the museum often hosts speakers, cultural events, performances, and celebrations. Well worth a visit, or several.",

Pricey but worth it!! 50-60 bucks per person with a drink, main and a side!",

They have a vast selection of wine and spirits to choose from. Steak reigns supreme here and you can get it with so many toppings and made just to your liking. They also have a lot of other great cuts of meats to choose from. It does get busy so make sure to get your reservation in and in advanced just to be safe.",
   "The St Paul Grill is a good place, but not the best, and it really should be. We have eaten here on several occasions as we stayed at the St Paul Hotel. They do have a great variety of dishes, the wild rice soup is always a good choice. Honestly I have just never been overly impressed with any steaks I have had, I am however very picky and even more so when paying top dollar. Worth a try but not sure it\u2019s worth the prices.",

This time it was much quieter. Not sure if it's that it was a Sunday evening and not super busy or they've got sound absorbing panels now or what but we really enjoyed ourselves and we able to carry a conversation without feeling like we were yelling at one another.

You can get coffee, a cocktail, a couple appetizers and a brunch dish for around $25-29 I believe, and it\u2019s all so deliciously worthwhile. The atmosphere is hip and awesome. Everyone is always having a great time and the mood is good. \nI highly recommend this little gem!",

   "Overall very good experience.  Giving 4 stars because there wasn't anything that WOW'd the wife and I - it was very good, but not amazing.  Also because my wife drank less than half of her strawberry (grenadine) lemonade and couldn't finish it because she didn't like the taste.  And because they add a 3% fee to cover \"increased wages for great employees\" that's not required and you can ask your server to remove. It just felt weird to be automatically charged this random extra fee instead of raising menu prices for example.  We asked to have it removed and used it as a portion of the tip to the waiter instead.\n\nI had the crab stuffed salmon (one of the evening's specials) and my wife had the stuffed ravioli.  We both finished our plates and were very happy.  Again, they were both very good, don't get me wrong, but nothing awesome/unique to brag about.\nThe only item that excited me was the bread - very soft on the inside and I loved the cheese crusting.  I wish they would have served it with the traditional olive oil and Parmesan cheese though - we didn't like the crushed olive \"dip\", but neither of us like olives much.\n\nGreat atmosphere - we liked the decor and especially the high ceilings.  Service was excellent.  Quick and friendly.\n\nIt was a $100 bill for the two of us and at the price, I think we will try somewhere else next time.  I feel like I could get a similar very good solid meal at Olive Garden for $60-80.",

   "This place is pretty good but a little expensive. They were however, very accommodating. To start, the bread is absolutely delicious. For a salad, I recommend the Caesar salad. The Chicken Parmesan was okay but the Spaghetti Carbonara was amazing. I do not drink alcohol but their list is extensive. Dress nice!",
   "Pazzaluna is upscale Italian with the price tag to show it.  The food is good and the service is great.  The beet salad I had was delicious.  But after just having returned from Italy the meal was over double the cost for a similar meal in Tuscany.  Something seems wrong about that."

My preferred, decaf coffee, with real cream served in the old fashioned little pitcher was great!. I ordered the All American Breakfast. Perfectly cooked eggs and crispy hashbrowns. The toast was thick, crusty and had a gooood amount of butter on it! I love me some butter! The bacon was generous and smokey flavored. It was my first time there,  but not my last!! Next time I'll stop for a cocktail and try an evening entree as all the pictures from reviews look fantastic!",

   "Hit and miss. A few flashes of brilliance here and there - that sweet potato dish!  They certainly have skills and create some real crowd pleasing dishes. And it\u2019s mostly perfectly fine. But it\u2019s nothing more than slightly above average updated Mexican food. Dinner was definitely better than lunch.  \n\nIt\u2019s a fun space, great vibe and great staff. Food is good, sometimes great, sometimes less than good.",
   "ringing in at $9 these fish tacos were perfect in every way. perfectly battered and lightly crisp and still hot from the fryer and balanced but the crunch of apple and cabbage. tortillas could be a little better but overall cannot complain. wish i had more room to try the salsa options.",
   "Amazing salsa and guacamole! Fantastic cocktails!\n\nThis place gets BUSY on Saturday nights, but the servers do a grade A job still being attentive to their patrons.\n\nMy guy got a barbacoa taco that he enjoyed. I insisted we get the yucca fries (as I always do when I see them on the menu), and they weren't awful but a bit too starchy for my taste.\n\nWe would definitely go back to try more.",
   "I really enjoyed Pajarito. The location is quaint, the flavors are amazing! I loved the Brussels sprouts. The prices are slightly high in my opinion, and the service could have been better.",
   "Very nice modern and not pretentious Mexican style fine-dining.  Great selection of tacos, fresh made chips and top notch salsas. Ask for recommendations and you wont go wrong."

   "Our first time to this lovely establishment but not our last.  We made reservations and the hostess was just fantastic.  We sat in the bar area waiting for our table and ordered drinks. The drinks were amazing but the staff that work there are beyond outstanding.  We were seated at a lovely table and the food was a delicious treat from beginning to end.  The baked brie was perfect to start things off.  The prime rib dinner was perfection. The steak dinner was beyond delicious.  Dessert with coffee ended one of the best meals we\u2019ve ever had in the Twin Cities.   But it was the excellent customer service that really made the dinner incredible.",

   "We went here for an early supper before the hockey game .  The restaurant is eye catching as soon as you walk in .  Looks really high end .\nWe ordered the wood fired mushroom dip and the fried shrimp and calamari for appetizers.   Not a heavy breading on the shrimp and calamari.   Just enough to coat it and it was fantastic.  Mushroom dip was ok .  Nothing special. \nI ordered the swordfish kabob .  Swordfish was good and  cooked well .  The plate come with a pile of white rice .  Bland and no flavor to it .",
   "Excellent food and service.  Stopped by the Downtowner before a Wild game and it was nice to see I wasn't the only fan who had that idea.  If you are a fan of pizza, the pizza here is great.  The wood fire style they make adds an extra level to the pizza.  I had the chicken, mushroom and smoked mozzarella and it was one of the better pizzas I have had.  I will definitely come back, especially if I am going to a Wild game and want to get something to eat before the game!",
   "Guac appetizer excellent. Walleye sandwich outstanding. (Cooked over wood) Only issue: Stella from tap was not cold. Otherwise a great place to eat.",
   "This place is probably one of the best places for the price point you can find in Saint Paul,  They have great steaks but I would highly recommend the sword fish as well, also if its in season they do amazing things with halibut. This is a really good date spot as well a good spot to get a nice meal before a wild game or concert, I haven't tried they're lunch yet but since there prices are really reasonable I would give it a go. The one thing I will say is that they're appetizers are true appetizers, they are meant to be a very light start to the meal  as opposed to most bar appetizers which are often can be a meal in themselves for one person, just be aware that  of that when getting apps.",
   "This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. The food, service and value was among the best other restaurants around. There is also complimentary parking in one of two lots. Unfortunately, we had a poor experience there last night. So bad that I'm unsure I will go there again. Perhaps it was a fluke experience given the large parties related to the Final Four, but the entire staff just seemed a bit off and the dining experience for the special event we were celebrating was sullied. \n\nThe server was not attentive. It took a long time to even get our orders taken. We had to ask/beg three times before any bread came out. No new silverware was provided or offered after salad/bread, or even after one piece of silverware fell (accidentally) on the ground. The server saw it and still didn't offer new silverware, but seemed perturbed by the situation. \n\nDishes lingered and were not cleared promptly. Refills on drinks were incredibly slow. A non-dairy/allergy friendly food request was not honored, despite the fact the server indicated it could have been. There was no offer for dessert or after meal drinks, and I believe I know why. When we got up from the table, staff zoomed over to prep the table for another group. It appeared that the restaurant had overlapping reservations. \n\nIn two meals, the main dish meat was undercooked to the point a good portion of the dishes were not eaten. No one ever asked us how things were after the good arrived (the server and manager historically do), and it was clear the server was content to extract the obligatory 20% gratuity based on our group size. I have no problem tipping well, but when you get incredibly poor service, particularly for a special event you are celebrating, that's an inappropriate tip amount.\n\nOverall, I really was disappointed with our latest dining experience and how it diminished the special event that we were celebrating. I am hopeful that this was a one time off experience. I am torn on whether to give the restaurant another chance."

   "Great service and very reasonably priced. The food was good (no major complaints), but it wasn't anything special. The dishes we had all lacked a little flavor and were more on the bland side. There are several other Italian restaurants in the MSP area that I would recommend above.",
   "Food was amazing, all the creme sauces are great. I've been here twice and both have been great experiences. One of the dishes came cold and they immediately replaced it with a fresh one free of charge. Great service all around.",
   "My husband and I visited La Grolla a few weeks ago on a whim. The location was great and the ambiance was quaint and romantic. We both had pasta dishes and they were delicious. The bruschetta that we started with was probably my my favorite part of the meal. Be sure to check this restaurant out!",

   "Colossal Cafe is our popular pick-up spot for scones & croissant muffins. Daily sweet & savory scones keep us coming back for more. Breakfast is so good with huge serving sizes. Sourdough toast off the flattop is mouth watering. If you have room for dessert get a \"flip\"! Beyond yummy!!",
   "Decided to check this out because it made the top Eaters twin cities list. Cute place. Loved meeting the owner and seeing how much love and care he puts into the place. \n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere and seating, cozy home feel to it which I appreciate. \n\nI had the mushroom, spinach, provolone omelette and the hubby had the apple, walnut, brie full stack flappers. \n\nThe omelette had a creamy sauce which was a pleasant treat. Their homemade pineapple habanero sauce definitely has a kick to it and complemented the eggs well. For some reason, and despite all this, it still tasted a bit bland for my taste buds. \n\nThe flappers are extremely filling. The pancakes are made with yeast, which I'd never tried before. I wouldn't have thought to mix apple with walnuts and brie on a pancake and it is a burst of flavor in your mouth. I enjoyed trying something new and like when places get creative with food. \n\nOverall a neat spot to try out.",

   "Very nice brunch place. Loved their homemade biscuits. They are huge, soft and they melt in the mouth. Their biscuits and gravy is to die for - strongly recommend them. Omelettes are light, fluffy with great options. Pastries are awesome too. \n\nMany vegetarian options available. Do try their wild mushroom gravy!! It's terrific! \n\nOverall nice and cozy Cafe in Como with good ambience and great food! \ud83d\ude0d",
   "This is a small, busy place with a unique waitlist. Customers order their food as a table, wait until an actual table opens up, then sit down, which is when the kitchen starts cooking your food, since you don't really have a server assigned to you. Tipping is confusing in this set up and since the place is so small, the tables are very snug together--anytime someone wants to move, they need to ask someone at a table next to them to move too. The food, however, is great! I've been twice and both times, thoroughly enjoyed brunch. Their known for their homemade colossal-sized biscuits and flappers (yeasted pancakes). I recommend the roasted vegetable omelette."

Their success is well deserved - and when Nick, the founder of this one-of-a-kind place, passed away (\ud83d\ude22  his presence is still felt there - yet his presence is deeply missed)  - his sons have done an amazing job of keeping Mancinis legendary reputation alive.

The staff are friendly and attentive. The other patrons were having fun and sharing stories of Mancini\u2019s from days last.  I throughly enjoyed my visit. The shrimp cocktail was amazing. The grasshopper drink was made perfect. Haven\u2019t one of those since the mid 90s at a small steakhouse in my hometown. Great memories. If you\u2019re in the area, go visit this place. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",

I was at the bar and they had a great happy hour. Draft beers for two and $3! You can't beat that. Next time I want to go a little earlier when I can have a burger and fries too.",
   "The food was really good. The nook curds are super good and the original nookie burger was awesome too! Only negative is it's a small building and our buzzer went off so they took us downstairs to a table but someone else sat down at it. They made us go back upstairs and wait an additional 10 minutes before getting seated after already waiting 20 minutes.",
   "Lately I have begun to worry that the soul is nothing more than what the imagination does with inner experience. The place from which your life flows is incalculably deep. In none of my visits to the Nook have donuts been available. Nor, I suppose, have they been unavailable, as the good people of this establishment do not present themselves as purveyors of donuts. The donuts are absent, and I feel their absence deeply. But when I grow weary, the wings carry me to higher ground.",
   "One of the very best burgers and very best fries in the whole Twin Cities.  Also a great environment... don't forget the old bowling alleys downstairs. A great place to relax and have a good time with good food.  Great wings too. This is an old, old favorite of ours. It's been great for many years.",
   "**The service I received during my last visit was maybe worth 1 star but I enjoy this place typically.**\n\nMy friends from out of town visited during the holidays so I wanted to bring her somewhere unique. When we got to the nook it was a steady pace. Not extremely busy but not dead either. We asked to sit in the basement. We were sat and greeted 5 minutes later. I was ready to order a drink at that time but the others were still browsing. The server took my order and left for about 10 minutes before bring back my beer.\nRather than asking if the others wanted something to drink he quickly walked away and went to a table nearby that had just sat. He took all of their drink orders, went to the bar to put them in, waited for the drinks and then returned to the table to take their food orders.... we had been sitting for 20 minutes at this point with no drinks or food orders for my friends.  He continued to walk past our table so I flagged him down to pay for my beer so we could leave. He took the card and came back and said \"it's on me\" and turned away. It was a bummer and a little embarrassing."

   "Top three things:\n1.  The burger, of course, one of the best in the Twin Cities\n2.  The fried cauliflower - plenty of flavor\n3.  Popcorn - really great to share with the table\n\nThings I wish I knew ahead of time:\n1.  At the time we went, the burger bun did not have a gluten free option\n2.  Scrambled eggs here are an amazing option\n3.  No parking lot, so metered street parking is your best bet",
   "; We entered on a quiet Sunday night close to 9PM. With three rooms connected for seating, Parlour had plenty of seating available. The ambiance, cozy and elegant. \n\nWe ordered the simple burgers, smash burger style, which were great. I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to add a fried egg to my burger, but no biggie - sunny side up will do just fine. The two large potato French fry order is definitely shareable, possibly even between three people. I highly recommend the garlic aioli for the fries, if you're into that sorta of thing.\n\nTheir in-house old fashioned cocktail bites and STRONG!\n\nStaff was great the moment we walked in. Hostess was patient with us. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The rest of the staff acknowledged and thanked us as we walked out the restaurant.\n\nOverall, it's been a great experience. We'll be returning and check out the other location.",
   "Much larger than the Minneapolis one but still the same great food. Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had (Parlour Burger). Brought my dad and by end of dinner he was talking when we were going to go again. Highly recommend and will be back.",
   "Another City Tin coaster in the books. Dined at Parlour Bar St. Paul. Enjoyed the uniqueness of popcorn fried in bacon fat and coated in pineapple dust. I thought the meat blend in the burger was top notch but the $14.50 price point for just the burger did seem a bit high. Fresh cut fries were a table favorite. Cider was tart and I am a fan of that so two thumbs up from me there.",
   "My friends and I tried this place because we heard that they have the best burgers in town. I was also cautiously optimistic because whenever I go to any restaurant know for their signature food item they always seem to cut corners on everything else.\n\nI got their Parlour Burger and added a friend egg and bacon. It was amazing considering that it was just meat and cheese! The sign of a good burger is that it doesn't rely on 10 extra fixings to be delicious.  My extras definitely leveled up my burger, but I would've been just as happy without them. \n\nThe bread and butter pickles were flavorful, crunchy, and generous! And the hand cut fries were awesome too - crispy outside, soft inside, and perfectly seasoned.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and our food arrived surprisingly quickly, but it was also 10:30 a.m. on a Saturday. I couldn't find any fault with anything. My whole experience was just that good!"

   "We have been going to Mamas for years, its always a trip as we live 90min away. Last night was our first time visiting since this pandemic started, and decided to try the take out only. We were not disappointed! Still the same amazing food and amazing service they are known for! Keep up the great work, such a fantastic restaurant!",
   "This place was absolutely amazing. They had great staff that was very communicative and was there whenever we needed a refill. We had delicious meals that filled us up and gave us left overs. At the end we even got some delicious complimentary ice cream cones. They were so cute!",
   "We\u2019ve lived nearby for about 5 years and finally decided to dine here. We were not disappointed! The food was delicious and the prices are super reasonable for the amount of food you get. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next week. We sat at the bar and the two bartenders were friendly and it was obvious they enjoy their job. Will definitely be returning.",
   "Mama's has been s Saint Paul staple for as long as I can remember. Fantastic food on the entire menu and the portions are GIGANTIC! Super friendly staff and very intimate atmosphere. If you're interested the neighborhood you absolutely must stop in. You won't be disappointed.",

Private bathrooms, a patio, private rooms are beautiful. Staff are professional and friendly. They have a bar that has plenty of spirits to choose from.",
   "Unique, delicious restaurant with a historic twist and inventive food. My wife and I came here on our 13 anniversary because we ate here for one of our first nice dates years ago. The plates have only gotten better. The patio is amazing. The service also great. We are vegetarian and loved our options. Try the bruschetta for a sure win, the celery and fennel for something interesting, and the wild mushroom pasta for a killer main course. We loved our meals and will definitely be back for another celebration.",
   "One more City Tin coaster done. WA Frost & Company in the Cathedral Hill neighborhood for brunch today. Admittedly, I did not love the Dutch Baby Pancake. Figs and lemon were good, but pancake was dry and needed more honey. This is not a slight against the establishment as a whole because the ambience was top notch and many other food items looked great.",
   "This a converted early 1900's pharmacy. This place has great food and ambiance with a historic flair. The food is great with a varied menu for all tastes. There is a restaurant and a bar and lounge. The bar has great drinks for the traditionalist and for the adventurous as well as for the nondrinkers. Great place to sit and relax.  Great place to take someone new to the area.",

They have good menu options and quality/quantity of portion was also good. \n\nThey have nice vegetarian options and Turkish coffee is a must try. Ambiance is nice and cozy which adds up to your mood.",
   "Outstanding COVID-19 safety measures! I ordered and paid online. Convenient parking was readily available. The door was blocked open, so that I didn't even have to touch it to go in. The staff greeted me from a distance as I picked up my order from a table just inside the door. I touched nothing but my order. GREAT PLANNING for keeping people safe and healthy! I super-appreciate businesses that are doing this well!",
   "i have decided to stop coming here since my last visit. im not sure if it has new ownership since the renovation in 2019, but the food is no where near as awesome as it used to be. prices have gone up and the food quality has gone way way down. makes absolutely no sense. i wont spend money here anymore. it was good while it lasted.",
   "We like a lot eating out. Last night we went to this magnificent restaurant which we didn\u2019t know before. We passed a beautiful time there with great food and  an experienced team and a distinguished chief cook. We  added this venue in our phone list  and we shall certainly visit again soon. We highly recommend.",
   "Came here for dinner with my sister on a weeknight. Super fresh food with great flavors. I had the chicken pita and my sister had the chicken wrap. We shared the cauliflower to start and it was absolutely delicious.\nThe pita was a bit messy but worth the mess.\nNice clean atmosphere that was a great place to catch up.\nPrices are very reasonable. I'm looking forward to going back and hopefully trying some of the desserts that looked awesome!"

Prices are market appropriate.  They add a surcharge for credit cards, which is posted.",

Don\u2019t leave without ordering flapjacks for dessert",

   "What a cute little place! I had never heard of it before until my daughter asked me to go to dinner with her at the restaurant. Very nicely greeted. Small but delicious menu. We each got an entree and a side to share. A small and unfamiliar wine selection so I took a chance on a red blend and it was wonderful! Lost one star because waiter was not as attentive as I would have liked. But overall nice place that I would return to.",
   "Great burgers in a unique location. The simplicity of their burgers is the key to their success. Their fries are also amongst the best we have ever tried. Will definitely visit them for brunch again. Before going to the farmers market or a Saints game.",
   "One of my favorite St. Paul restaurants. With this pandemic,  they have converted some of their great sandwiches and sides into a great take out value for couples and families."

We had a Baked Rigatoni with Chicken Meatballs but the cream sauce is what sets this off as the ground up salami makes it stand out. You may want to lick the casserole dish! The procuitto and artichoke pizza is delicious as it looks in the picture. The freshly made crushed tomato sauce, a nice crunch crust that holds up the toppings, and a fresh mozzarella that brings it all together! Go to Mucci's and enjoy as those ladies in the kitchen are on fire!",

   "AMAZING FOOD!! My partner and I have been a few times and the food is always incredible! The rotating menu keeps things fresh and the staff are on point with their recommendations. Smaller, cozy atmosphere and attention to detail, would suggest to anyone looking for a new date-night experience or a nicer dinner with family.",
   "What more can I say other than... AMAZING. The Bryant/Lake corner curse has finally been lifted and we can all enjoy some of the best pizza, cocktails and SERVICE Minneapolis has to offer. The Calzone Pizza was life changing and their espresso martini will keep me coming back for more. 5 stars!"

   "This was a transcendent experience. I cannot describe what it was like to bring this chicken home to a place where my wife and I (who are solid cooks) eat and sleep. I have never experienced something to this level. I was transported to a world of spicy and sweet chicken I have never been. I've eaten in the restaurant more than 5 times but bringing the chicken to a place that hasn't been consecrated is a monumental moment in my life.\n\nThis place makes it happen.\n\nThank you, Revival. I am forever in your debt.",
   "Great southern style place and maybe the best fried chicken in the twin cities. Got the whole bird with \"poultrygeist\" ghost pepper sauce and another tamer seasoned whole bird. The chicken was still juicy and flavourful under the spicy, crunchy, well sauced skin. And yes, we ate it all. The heat wasn't too bad. \n\nThe sides are delicious as well and really feels like southern food. The hush puppies are a very generous serving for a side. Really enjoyed the mashed potatoes here as well. Might as well get all the sides honestly. The burger cannot be cooked to order. It's similar to Culver's butter burger, where it's a very thin, greasy, yet tasty burger.\n\nWould recommend if you enjoy southern food or friend chicken. A bit pricey, but fair. The cost feels worth the visit.",
   "It's tough to find good Southern cooking this far into the Icy North. Revival stands as an exception to this statement.\nTheir small menu is packed full of flavorful, delicious delights. Their fried chicken is exemplary, and their other menu items are equally satisfying.\nThe wait staff is courteous and swift, and the atmosphere is pleasant, if not especially exciting.\nGiven the quality of the food, the prices are appropriate, though having to order sides a la carte was a bit odd feeling, though understandable given the portion sizes at work.",
   "We've been here and the location in Minneapolis several times. Food is always great. Tennessee Hot chicken is addictive. Southern fried also good. Either way, best fried chicken  in the Twin Cities. Barbecue excellent. Sides vary by location, but also good.",
   "If you want the BEST\u2026. I mean BEST BBQ sauce in the entire world, you MUST come here. They have this orange brown sauce that he said was habanero, but it is NOT at all as spicy as it sounds. When the sauce hits your tongue its like a tingly little sweet spicy feeling, not just taste, this sauce has a feeling. And it\u2019s crazy GOOD! Our ribs were some of the best ribs I\u2019ve ever had! If you\u2019re not used to smoked ribs, the meat is a little tough compared to ribs that just fall off the bone. But with the sauce these ribs were to die for. I had so many endorphins running through my body after eating this. The fried chicken though, that had to be the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life. The skin was crispy and melt in your mouth at the same time. I also love how they are very environmental friendly. No plastic straws, no paper napkins, even no paper towels in the bathroom! We will definitely be coming back!! I give it a 7 out of 10 for sure. \n\nSAUCE 10/10\nRIBS 6/10\nCHICKEN 9/10\nMAC & CHEESE 8/10\nVALUE 7/10\nATMOSPHERE 6/10 *just a little loud\nLOCATION 6/10 *limited parking"

Everyone we met were friendly and follow through with information pertinent to our experience. \n\nOrdered the El Grand Catch, the Little catch, 3 lbs of head shrimp and two lbs of crawfish. My wife was allergic to shell seafood so she had fries and a fish sandwich.  Food came out in no time! Everything tasted grand! Sauce were on point. \n\nThere were 7 of us so we made a reservation. We got there 10 minutes late but they had our table ready for us and we didn\u2019t have to wait. Perfect place for twosomes or small groups. Make sure to reserve if you have large group.

The food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  They sell some of their noodle dishes and sauces in the grocery store.  There were a lot of customers so this must be a very popular restaurant.   I liked the store inside the building but it would have been nice if prices were posted.   I probably would have purchased a few items.  I highly recommend this place!",
   "One of my favorite restaurants in Minnesota. The entire restaurant/shop is full of character with lots of features including an espresso bar/bakery, a separate shop for traditional Italian Groceries, and the main restaurant. At less than $20 for a large pizza it is an affordable price, but don't think the quality is cheap. Cosettas has the best most delectable and delicious pizza in the entire state of Minnesota.",

Everything is fresh and done with love. They also have a wonderful restaurant and bakery. I wasn't expecting all of that but I loved it.",

This service always continues to the last goodbye, and I appreciate that more than can be expressed here.\n\nThe food is top notch, from the menu (which is direct and reflects a restaurant that knows what it's strengths are and does them well, while at the same time always presenting a conundrum in that it all looks SO GOOD.) I always find what I need though... \ud83d\ude0a\n\nOnce the food has arrived, the experience goes South... In the best way possible. Each bite is filled with flavor and texture and on my goodness I am hungry now thinking about it.

Kathy and staff worked all the details out seamlessly, kindly served us quickly, and even allowed us to take sparkler pictures out on the front steps. We are so grateful that Holman's Table made our big day so special!",
   "Short; Great service and food. Hands down a hidden gem.\nLong; Building itself is really neat. Old terminal. Holman's Table looks right out to the runways and airfield. Ramps next to the building allow for easy parking of aircraft. Also a nice patio for sunny days. \nStaff was friendly and polite. From start to finish the service was on par.\nFood was prepared and presented very well. Good mixed drink selection, my wife really enjoyed her mojito. The meals were well put together, presented nicely, and cooked to perfection.\nShort ribs just fall apart. And the Amish chicken was perfectly cooked and buttery. Deserts again, well presented and flavorful.\nWill be stopping by again soon.",
   "Holman's table is a unique restaurant, located in a wing of the still active control tower of the old St. Paul airport. A very nice location, with knowledgeable and friendly staff and a small but nice menu that feels both homey and classy. From the lunch menu I had eggs with corned beef hash. Totally home made, including the corned beef, with a very good mix in the chunky hash. I chose a side of French onion soup that was very thick and rich, with melted cheese on top. I understand that they're famous for their Reuben too, with their home made corned beef. Very good desserts too - but not cheap. You can watch planes taking off and landing, or splurge and get a helicopter ride along with a great meal. Have fun!"

   "My husband and I had an excellent time here. The staff are tremendously hospitable and well trained. The food was fresh and delicious! We love the variety of seafood and how it was prepared. I personally loved the seaweed garnishes, I think they have a big impact to the freshness of the dish and they are delicious! We are really satisfied with our food and the pricing. The weekly special was reasonably priced and offer a great wide range of raw, cooked, and different culture cuisines.",
   "I love this place! I've been a few times now and every time I dine here I get exceptional service and lip-smacking delicious food. Today I sat at the bar for happy hour and did some studying. The bartender was very welcoming and friendly. Food came out quickly. Everything was prepared perfectly, especially the calamari! That green sauce is to die for!!!!! This is quickly becoming one of my go to spots in St. Paul.",
   "Great place. You know its fresh when the menu is small and still varied. Great location. Lunch hour parking is a pain but it's only two.blocks from the light rail.",
   "I went to dinner here on a week night. I had a small plate of chilled scallops which was delicious and a large plate of salmon. The food was so good and the flavors were unique. The atmosphere was really nice too. I ate at the bar and the service was excellent. Would love to go back.",
   "Overall, a good experience. Portions are a bit small for the price but the seafood was good. We ordered the Diamond seafood tower to share, which was all good but seemed pricey ($68) for the little amount of items there were. The lobster roll was pretty good and was more rightfully priced. Service was excellent."

   "I\u2019ve made a terrible mistake. For the life of me I am not sure why this place was not on my radar sooner, but my wife suggested it for our anniversary dinner. After reviewing the menu and pics we gladly made the reservation. \n\nI am glad we did as everything from the food to the room to the great service exceeded our expectations. Well done!\n\nPlease do start with a fine cocktail and the well curated cheese plate. Then it is off to the meat. Both of our steaks was perfectly done and delicious. Make haste to the Commodore!",
   "A really swanky place, replete with silver-framed mirrored hallways and walls, to a Deco bar that will make you catch your breath. Dine here, lounge here, cocktail here, be seen here...it's a luxurious getaway with that speakeasy feel that gangster-era St. Paul is famous for. Happy hours are best...but an hour is best if you're feeling like sporting for something decadent. Casual, dress-up, or just hanging with your friends, you'll find the Commodore more than a little welcoming.",
   "The staff, atmosphere and food here are outstanding. Possibly the best New York strip steak we've ever had (and we've had a lot!) And the smoked butter and Parker rolls were heavenly.\nAlso it was very clean and well kept, with a special space set up for the social conditions needed right now. I felt like we were in good hands. A++",
   "I'll break down my experience/observations here: \n\n - Atmosphere: Beautiful Art-Deco inspired place - very ritzy interior with jazz music played throughout. \n- Dress Code: I recommend at least smart-casual. \n- Cocktails: The cocktails are top notch. I had two drinks: an Old-Fashioned, and their signature cocktail, \"The Commodore\". Both were excellent. \n- Food: Their menu is rather limited and a tad overpriced, through the food itself was prepared and presented well. \n\nI would have given 5 stars, but I waited for 30 mins to get seated for my 7:15 reservation, which was made days in advance. No other knocks otherwise.",
   "Wow! Like stepping into an elegant dream. I don't normally like lobster, but I could down those lobster deviled eggs all day! Be sure to order a Fitzgerald and plan on spending some time here just taking it all in."

   "First and foremost great customer service. The food is fresh and hot and come out relatively fast. We had the lamb gyro and chapati wrap and can not recommend them enough. The fries were seasoned and hot of the fryer. Decent amount of seating and they deliver through third party apps as well. Great for a quick lunch or a bite to eat while in downtown St. Paul.",
   "This has been a go to for a number of years. And for good reason. In the same they have also grown to have another location if I'm not mistaken. Gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because recently the food tastes like it's being less focused on. Hands down though, fries are the best in town. How do you make fries so delicious!?!? Owner is a great person and staff is nice",
   "Parking might be tricky.\nTheir food has wonderful flavors. Chicken Fantastic. Samosas- beware their accompanying \"sauce\" or chutney is very spicy but it serves as a palette cleanser. Their food is authentic and delicious.\n\nDon't forget to try their Spiced tea!!",
   "This spot is the one I always prefer. I go to many restaurants but to this place I  constantly return again and again. The team is very welcoming and the food they offer is so flavorful. I never miss an opportunity to have a decent meal in this place. Highly recommended.",

   "I was intrigued by the menu so we decided to check this place out before heading to a show at the Amsterdam Bar. We sat at the bar. I ordered a Minnesota Mule which was not on the menu but the bartender whipped up his own house recipe! We also tried the Old Fashioned and the Ranch Hand (woo-wee, spicy, spicy!) . We ordered the Impossible Burger, Rosemary fries and cheese curds. All of which were pretty good. 4 stars for the cheese curds served with honey AND a house ranch sauce! At first glance this place may seem a little pretentious but trust me, it settles. And one tip: stick to a 2 drink minimum. Those spirits are potent! I'm sure we'll wander back in again at some point!",
   "We dined here only because it was close to our hotel and it looked interesting when searching online. We were so impressed we made dinner reservations for the very next evening as well.\n\nThe Tamarind Chili wings might be the best wings I have ever had. Asian inspired flavours with citrus and a really good kick to finish it off. Absolutely done to perfection.\n\nThe Singapore Broil was prepared exceptionally well. Tender and full of flavour we paired ours with cheesy garlic mashed potatoes and the green beans. The small plate was more than enough for two, with sides.\n\nThe gin and tonic is made with in house tonic. My wife loves Gin and tonic and promises it it absolutely worth it (I am not a fan of Gin). The tonic is made with a hint of lime and it has been perfected.\n\nThe Old Fashioned is done really well. A twist on this cocktail being made with whiskey but the flavour is excellent and the duck ice puts the presentation over the top. I enjoyed two of them during dinner.\n\nGreat food and great location right in the heart of downtown St. Paul.",
   "Stopped by here with my boo for a cocktail after wandering the Winter Carnival.\n\nThe kitchen had just closed at ~10, which was fine since we weren't looking for food. The place was JUMPING with people. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders provided pretty quick service (greet, make drinks, get tab) in spite of the crowd. Not the friendliest service, but that can't be held against anyone because - and I can't overstate this - the tavern was super busy.\n\nWe each got a signature cocktail, and we both enjoyed our drinks. Atmosphere was young people, like 21-24. My guy and I aren't that much older, but weren't huge fans of the college-kids-being-\"classy\" vibe from the other patrons.\n\nBut drinks were good and staff was efficient.",
   "They had great cocktails! I'm vegan, so for dinner I got the Impossible Burger with no cheese and no bun. My burger came wrapped  in a lettuce bun which was fantastic and thoughtful. I did the green beans as a side order. My husband got the prime rib, and said everything was perfect. We will for sure be back again, and love to see a place that can accommodate different dietary restrictions!",
   "I visit this lovely place  a lot! This is my favorite spot to grab a bite.  I go there routinely. The cooking is great, the team is helpful and the prices are decent. I enjoy going in this restaurant for a good meal."

There is a very unassuming sign in front, which does not hint at the fabulous experience you will have inside. There is street parking, but, it has never been an issue for us.",
   "Great little French restaurant! The atmosphere was intimate and cozy. Our service was great. We started with a goat cheese small plate, had lobster crepes and smoked trout for entrees, and the vanilla pot de creme for dessert. The app and entrees were DELICIOUS. The pot de creme was fine but I wouldn't order it again (Bar Brigade, please replace this dessert item with something else that stands up to the rest of the incredible food we had last night). I'm still giving 5 stars because overall, our experience was fantastic.Definitely coming again!"

   "In love with this restaurant. I've driven by it so many times but never realized how nice it was inside and that they had such good and unique food! We started with one of the favorites of the restaurant, the Buffalo Brussels Sprouts. These are a must. If you don't like veggies or greens, these will change your life. We also shared the walleye dinner and a special of the night, a type of tostada with crab, radishes, and avo spread. We also had their margarita drink which had a kick to it and was strong!  One of my new favorite places in St Paul.",
   "Nice ambiance and based on other reviews I read up on here, I had high hopes that the food would be on point -- disappointingly, the items we ordered we ordered were just \"meh\". \n\nKorean Fries: Wasn't horrible but nothing to be excited about either. The dips were just ok as well. Overall, the fries would've tasted better if they didn't saturate it with sodium & spices. 2/5 Stars.\n\nSzechuan Noodles: This was utter misery! A bad attempt to fuse kimchi with some undercooked noodles, shiitake mushrooms & leathery tofu that simply didn't mesh!!! The tangy-acidity of either the kimchi or the sauce that they used was overpowering, leaving no room for any other flavors. 0/5 Stars.\n\nPork Cheeks: Pork was really tender with jalapeno grits which add a unique twist of flavor & texture. The pork cuts though tender, were a tad too salty for my taste. Ease up on the salt and this may have earned 4 stars.  3/5 Stars\n\nWinter Spiced Bread Pudding: The best item out of the lot. Pudding bread topped with butterscotch sauce, spices and crunchy, candied almond clusters. 4/5 Stars \n\nWould I go again? Likely not. Or if I ever did, I would very much make sure not to order any of the above items again except for the Spiced Bread Pudding."

The red sauce is amazing and the portions are very good so you will not be disappointed. When you walk in you feel like you are travelling back in time, like you are in a movie or something.

   "The food was good.  A few items great.  Cacio E Pepe was terrific, the asparagus was wonderful.  The blueberry sauces on desserts were extremely flavorful.  Unfortunately the kitchen was amazingly slow, despite the dining room being quite not full.  One meal, lobster mac and cheese was straight up cold.  And two meals came out 5+ minutes later than the others, after already experiencing a long wait.  It would have been okay if it was just adults, but we had kids and the extra 20+ minutes just didn't work.  Appetizer menu sounded great, but the prices scared us off.  The drink menu was good, decent array of great craft beer.  There were odd things no longer available though, both on the food and beverage menus.

   "First and foremost they seated us 30 minutes early because my girlfriend and I showed up much earlier than the rest of our group which was great. Then they let us order our bottomless mimosas early so we got to drink while we waited for the rest of our group! The atmosphere was very calming and it gave off a comforting vibe. The food was really good to! Our mimosas came in wine glasses so they were big!! Never once finished my mimosa before they refilled it which was wonderful!\nThe only complaint I had was they seem to put a big char on all their steaks. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) in the middle but the outside of all our steaks were charred a bit too much for our preference. Besides that everything was delicious!"

But to make sure that it would be like the waitress brought a small sample of it to try so we didn't waste our money which I really appreciated.  We got this dish the was like a Bready, meaty, and peppery mixture. Inside the mixture had cut up pieces of the same bread meant to consume the dish with. Very good, huge portions. Total bill was like 13 bucks and this plate could feed 3-5 people. We got #26/27."

   "Very nice restaurant to visit after going to the River Center. This place had a nice environment and some hockey stuff on display. The service was a little slow but the food was great. I definitely recommend this place. The pretzel appetizer was fantastic and so was my cobb salad.",
   "I\u2019ve seen some reviews stating that service is slow or nonexistent. I did not see this. We were in last  Saturday before a MN Wild game. We were greeted immediately and at. We were also brought water and our beverage orders were taken. The place was increasingly busy and soon the bar area was packed. We never felt neglected and our server was attentive.\n\nThe food was very good. We had the brussel sprouts, scallop pasta, risotto and flat bread pizza. All were very tasty. Our cocktails were also very tasty, but not very strong. We\u2019d definitely come back. We had great service, great food and decent drinks. The atmosphere is really nice with the fireplace.",
   "Food is good, more-so gourmet with a limited 1-page pricey menu, but you pay for location.  Atmosphere is casual.  Service during our visit wasn\u2019t up to par. Not going back.",
   "Went here during lunchtime on a Sunday and had to order from the brunch menu. Food was okay, just very limited choices. Server was excellent and very nice ambience!",
   "To be honest I haven't tried their food. This is my after Wild game stop. They make great old fashions if you're interested. I always request the girl in the gold rim glasses as she is very attention oriented server."

   "WOW!!!  I'm not a big Valentine's date night kind of guy, but Caffe Biaggio may have changed that for good.  Their special Valentine's Day seating last night was TOTALLY AWESOME!  \n\nWe try to dine at Caffe Biaggio a couple times a year and should be going a lot more often.  They are the very BEST Italian restaurant in the Twin Cities.  Last nights seating included 3 great entrees . . . Steak and Lobster,  Salmon and one of their signature regular menu items Gnocchi in red sauce.  3 of the 4 of us each had a different entree and they were all perfectly done. The appetizer, salad and dessert were also perfect and delicious.\n\nService at Caffe Biaggio is always top notch and last night was no different.  \n\nCaffe Biaggio continues to be a gem.  I would recommend it to everyone.  For groups, for special occasions and especially for date night.  If you haven't been, and you consider yourself a foodie, you've missed out on one of the best experiences in the Twin Cities!  Go!",
   "First time. Linguine with shrimp in a light lemon cream sauce. Delicious! Good ratio of shrimp to broccoli to pasta. One recommendation, less onion and more lemon.",
   "We met with friends at this place for a meeting. we heard about this spot from a lot of people.  Well, it was a winning. the staff members were so friendly and we had an excellent feeling. The food was just great. We loved this spot a lot and we will visit this place again. Highly recommended.",
   "I give this establishment a three stars. This is a beautiful establishment. The ambience and feel is delightful. The service was great. The waiter who served me was very friendly and professional. The only thing that stops me from giving this establishment a four or five is the food. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were slightly dry and the sauce was watery. The meatballs had a great kick to it but it was ruined by the dryness of the meatballs. Also, the watery sauce lowered the quality of the dish. My dish was a letdown after the great service and atmosphere.",
   "What great ambiance at this place. Tim was our server and he was very helpful with suggesting dishes. I had lobster risotto and it was great."

   "Top notch Italian Restaurant in MSP.  They have plenty of vegetarian options which made me feel at home. Their deserts are drool worthy and you are bound to have withdrawal symptoms long after your dinner.",
   "I get to eat here a lot since I work in the area. I must say their customer service is always good and they keep the spot neat constantly. Prices are convenient and they serve big portions.",
   "A fine dining Italian restaurant, not family style like Bucas, is a great experience. We spent alittle over two hours here enjoying the food and friendly staff. The courses are separated by classic Italian courses, however, are not meant to be a four course dinner. Each dish is a sufficient meal. The portions are typical fine dining portions. The cooking here was great, very few cooking errors or mistakes. In a party of six, everyone enjoyed their food and atmosphere. The lighting can be considered alittle dark at night. Definitely worth a revisit and would recommend the gnocchi.",

   "This is a very cute bistro style restaurant. We made reservations last minute and were able to do an early dinner. Service was attentive without hovering\u2014we each had a pasta and shared the snap pea and burrata salad. The salad was amazing, really light yet well seasoned. The pastas were both good\u2014very much a homemade feel. They were good but not great, but I\u2019d like to return and try out some of their entrees. Considering the tip is factored into the prices, the prices are pretty fair here. Finally, I should mention the decor is wonderful, really simple but cute. Would definitely visit again!",
   "Cozy casual atmosphere with great food!! Meatball was amazing \ud83e\udd24 Recommend making a reservation from their website. Good place for a date - nice but not fancy. Prices are reasonable considering they include gratuity.",
   "Superb service, lovely atmosphere, and one of the best meals I've had in the Twin Cities. Every dish we had was amazing - the celery salad (one of the most unique and refreshing salads, even for my husband who doesn't eat salad often) the bucatini (totally worth the hype from the Star Tribune), the risotto (unique in many ways, flavors off the chart), and a chocolate mouse desert. Everything was perfect. I want to go back asap to try everything else! Also appreciate that they include gratuity in the cost of the dinner.",
   "I've been meaning to try Hyacinth for some time now and I'm glad I did. It's a small restaurant, small menu and small plates. We liked everything we tried but nothing stood out as the best dish of the night. I'll be excited to come back when they change their menu in the future.",
   "This is a truly great restaurant. Everything we had was great. The pasta is seasoned and cooked perfectly and the service was excellent. This is a Bachelor Farmer level of food and service imo. It's pricey but worth it for a special occasion."

So if you're looking for just a nice piece of steak without the chef trying to be complicated with all that extra flavor and spice, this is it! Prices are great and diner has an 80's feel/atmosphere to it.",

   "I love this place. My favorite neighborhood diner. It's not new or fancy, but it is cozy.  Good food, great prices and friendly staff. Not a ton of seating, so you may have a wait on peak days and hours. My girlfriend and I mainly come for breakfast. Good coffee too. Check it out.",
   "I didn't hate it,  lol. The service and food was fine. Didn't stand out. In their defense the French Toast is awesome!! The rest of the meal was average. Our server was polite and prompt",
   "Everything was alright. It seems like a basic diner. Most of the food is bland and some of it tasted extremely processed. The fish was freshly caught and fried. The seating is outdated and was uncomfortable for the handicapped or overweight in our group.\n\nIn response to owner, I mean that is pretty much what I said. A 3 star literally means \"It's okay.\" No one is blaming you for picking a small space for your restaurant, it's just important for some people to know that they may be uncomfortable or in pain before they decide to come there. It's mainly the gravy and soup pictured that tasted processed. Made from scratch can mean a lot of things, but even if it was made from mostly fresh ingredients, those two things didn't taste very good to us. If you hear this from multiple patrons maybe you can know what to tweak. Good fish though!"

Jose did a great job helping to order and immediately suggested a margarita and a buffet - bother were outstanding. Family owned and you can tell by their level of professionalism and information. Really happy I went and cannot wait to go back!",
   "This place has amazing food and a great selection of it. The complimentary chips and salsa before dinner are some of the best I've had (top 3)! Warning one of the salsas has a little zing to it but the other is spicy not to spicy though (although I love spicy food)! I had the Enchiladas Verde and what can I say, close your eyes picture the best enchiladas Verde and that's what I got.",
   "I celebrated my nomination last night in this delicious restaurant. I am glad to say that it was a marvelous evening and the venue was clearly the reason for this outstanding celebration. The team  cooperated in a very nice way, the cuisine was extremely good and my friends were so  thrilled. We shall definitely return for more celebrations. Thank you very much.",
   "I have only been there for lunch time buffet going on 3 years now. You don't know what your getting everyday on about 1/3 of it.They change it up. Good selection. It's more on the authentic side, and not too spicy unless u make it that way.  Nice place inside, its a quick get in, eat and get back to work thing for me. Good service and nice people. Check it out.",
   "I've been enjoying Boca Chica for more than 30 years. The food is always delicious; the location is inviting and comfortable. Today was no different. I opted for fajitas this afternoon but, if you can go for lunch during the week, I'd recommend the lunch buffet. Their chicken enchiladas are also top notch."

   "In my opinion, if an Italian restaurant can't make an awesome plate of spaghetti and meatballs, it's not worth trying anything else on the menu. Well, this is just about the best spaghetti you're going to find anywhere. Homemade noodles, meatballs which hold together well but are still a little bouncy, and sauce so good I'm tempted to request it as a cup of soup. Great job, Carmelo's!",
   "All the soups and bread are homemade and delicious!  My favorite entrees are the Chicken Milanese, spaghetti and meatballs, and ravioli Carmelo. It packs up and travels well, so is great for takeout or delivery. \n\nOnly suggestion, offer desserts for delivery if possible!",
   "Great food great environment. I thought service was a little slow since there was only 1 server so if you're in a rush it's not ideal. But otherwise they're friendly and food taste fresh and authentic. Love it and will come back later",
   "We Love Carmelo\u2019s. Hardest working wait staff, with amazing customer service skills. Quiet, lovely place with Fantastic Food. We are sure lucky Carmelo\u2019s is on the neighborhood. Thank You!!",
   "A white table cloth & candlelit coursed Italian ristorante with gentle, mellow flavored.  I liked the atmosphere and wine list but the food we had tonight needed more flavor...and salt.  I did looking forward to bread with a flavored oil dip but they had pre-packaged butter bars instead, although the bread was super fluffy, soft and delicious with the butter.  The calamari was a little too soft and not crispy enough and didn't taste salted at all... but perhaps the lemon aioli is supposed to make up for it?  A slight disappointment, however, overall, the foods would be good for those who are severely watching their salt intake.  Service was good, friendly and attentive.  \n*Shrimp Garlic Aglio Olio, Shrimp Macalester & Calamari appetizer. \n*Drinks: a mixed white comprised of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, voigner and moscato: less dry with a hint of sweetness but with a nice, lingering taste.  I normally don't like any sweet white but this one was tasty.  And hubby's italian beer: light."

It\u2019s just an expensive cheese pizza.",

So far, this is the best pizza I've had in Minnesota (and I eat pizza very regularly). The inside has a cool hipster vibe. Give it a shot you wont be disappointed.",
   "What an absolutely wonderful pizza. I went early on a Saturday evening, so it was pretty busy. In spite of that, we never felt rushed and we never felt ignored. I had the #1, a nice, simple cheese pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The crust had a wonderful crisp to it and the cheese was salty and fresh. My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that the tomato sauce was fairly transparent in flavor. It felt like it massive needed a little more time to simmer, or a little more seasoning, but that is splitting hairs.\n\nGreat job Black Sheep! I will be back, and I will be recommending you to my friends."

   "Warm greeting from several staff as soon as we entered.  Very nice written welcome from Fasika on Page 1 of the menu. Many entrees to select on the menu and our server helped guide us navigate the options. The combination entrees are very large and can easily serve two people. We had the beef combo and the flavor was excellent! We had to work to finish it all and we did not quite succeed.  The servers are friendly, happy and attentive. The dining room has plenty of space. There was a family with an infant and 3 toddlers across the room and they had plenty of space around a large table. We will definitely be back and we will bring friends with us!  We live in Minnetonka and yes, Fasika\u2019s is worth the drive!",
   "Busy place, slow paced service, but as there is only one server covering everything, that can be forgiven. Food was hot and fresh but my dish limited to just cabbage and grape leaf. I ate at 6pm and many dishes--including coffee--were off the menu. There is another traditional ethnic restaurant one block north with a better space and pricing. I would venture there first before returning to Fasika."

We\u2019ve always had friendly servers who have great recommendations. Their food is phenomenal... I can\u2019t say enough about the Pulled Bacon BLT (even with needing a gluten free bun). What motivated me to leave a review now is their exceptional service during the Stay at Home orders. It was easy to place our order over the phone and they were outside within seconds of pulling into the parking lot. The food was well packaged, and was still hot by the time we got home. I miss going out to restaurants but this was such a great experience tonight that I appreciate Brunson\u2019s on a whole new level. Thank you for making our night!",
   "Fantastic service! Great cheese curds, the honey and balsamic aioli dips sound like a weird combo, but they work somehow- and it's delicious. I got the #No Payne no gain burger and my husband got the Reuben burger, both were great.",
   "Great food and good service.  We tried a few of their burgers and all were good.  I wasn't too sure when I saw that their \"wings\" were thighs, but it was great.  Cooked perfectly! And they were nice and crunchy with the dry rub.  They had a great beer list and happy hour specials too.  Will definitely return.",
   "Amazing food and even better people. We love stopping by here for apps, dinner, or even a few drinks. The staff is always tentative and very nice. Making this a usual neighborhood spot for us!",
   "Soooo, we knew we were full, but we just kept eating, and eating. Now we are one wafer thin mint away... We always split the curds. Tonight we were craving their fish and chips.  Stellar. Their serving size is plenty, so we decided to split the fish and a berry salad.  Should not have gotten the full size salad. Is pretty busy,  so relax knowing you will probably wait a bit.  SUPER nice staff."

   "This is an old school bar and restaurant. Think leather easy chairs, soft lighting, tons of rooms and a jazz combo on the weekend. There are two different bars and a specific bar menu, though the full menu is available at the bar also. Tiny parking lot, valet is available. We've been twice and had an amazingly delicious dinner as well as a great night with friends in the bar. Attracts an older crowd, dress is everything from dressy to track suits. Given the prices, I'd dress up a bit. Drinks are strong and the bar food is good for a group. Only complaint is that we got a very loud table next to the bar even after making a reservation. Lots of room for big dinner groups.",
   "Food was great but the service was amazing. Chef went out of his way and made us steak sandwiches from left overs. Out of town guest and would highly recommend.",

I've only come in for drinks and usually enjoy being belly up and people watching.  Such a diverse crowd. Very classy place, and one of my new favorite spots in St Paul. I'll definitely be back soon!",
   "Another delightful dinner on a very busy Valentine\u2019s Day evening. Food was outstanding. Service was impeccable. The owner is always around to make sure things are right. Definitely worth treating yourself once in awhile. A tip, for a quiet evening ask to reserve a table in the dining room and not the bar. The bar is a fun atmosphere but quite loud.",

   "We visited here twice on weekend of 8/9/19.  Once on a Friday and on a Sunday.   I can say on a Sunday, best place to go downtown.  We went through several different places, and this one was the place to be.   We enjoyed to food, atmosphere and wait staff.",
   "I stopped at the restaurant on my way to a Saint's baseball game ... Such a nice place and atmosphere. The service was excellent and we were a big party. The menu has great selections; try the spicy hamburgers; that is if you enjoy spicy food. The restaurant has outdoor seating.",
   "We went here for my best friends birthday. A group of 11 happy celebratory girls. 10 minutes in we were all shushed from the bartender for being too loud. Needless to say it ruined the happy mood and we got our tab and left immediately to Barrio next door. We were happy to take our money elsewhere and not get scolded for having a great time. Didn\u2019t realize The Bulldog was a retirement home.",
   "The cheese curds were excellent. Our waitress was great. They have a great selection of craft beers.  Just wasn't impressed with the actual entrees.",
   "I love their philly cheese steaks, the best in the twin cities. Very cozy atmosphere and always a good time to bring a date or have some fun with the girls at the bar. When it\u2019s nice out it\u2019s a very cute place to take a romantic walk after in the little park across the street."

   "Waitress was really nice. The avocado crab bread was delicious. My tomahawk steak med/rare was dry with no flavor. Didn't really seem like it was a 20oz. Maybe a 16oz. Usually when i eat steak i don't really use A1 but i had to because lack of flavor and dryness. The loaded potato only had cream and like 4 specks of bacon. My lady got the trio medallion she said hers tasted dry right away. The salad was so small and plain. Maybe try the ribs or pasta if i ever go again. Definitely not a place i would get a steak again.  Ordered a Purple Rain. It was really sweet but barely alcohol didn't even catch a buzz and i only drink like once a month. I gave the three stars because the waitress was really nice.",
   "Very tasty food but most definitely not the place to go on a budget. The free shuttle to the Wild game was wonderful! We will definitely be back!",
   "Got there to our 9:15 p.m. reservation for Saint Valentine's Day night with my long dress coat and no coat check. People were hanging their coats on the backs of their chairs. Mine would have been sitting half on the floor. Libby the hostess helped me resolve this by allowing me to hang it at the hostess stand! \ud83d\ude42 Great cuts of steak! \ud83e\udd69I had the Tomahawk! It had some fat on it too that I enjoyed with the delicious perfectly cooked meat! My two dogs got a little taste as well!\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udc36  I picked it as I saw it was one of their specialties.\ud83c\udf78 I was glad their menu labeled things that way. The vegetable was green beans. They were cooked to perfection but there were so few. Molly our waitress immediately noticed this and rectified it! Everything went smoothly until the bartender started playing very unromantic hip hop, I think.\ud83c\udfb5 Fortunately, it was towards the end of our meal and Molly, our waitress smoothed things out.\ud83d\ude07 Another very helpful and patient waitress took many pictures of my Valentine and me\ud83d\udc98 with my confusing camera, to commemorate the evening. Great staff and great chops! Thank you! My date was very pleased with the whole evening!",
   "Great experience.  The staff were fantastic, friendly and fast. The food was excellent. I had an issue with my dish. Not only did they make it right, they comp'd us a desert to boot. Just fantastic all around. Highly recommended. Definitely going back.",
   "Craved a good Steak and they delivered.  The ribeye was juicy and flavorful without the salty/sodium injected taste.  The New York Strip was thick and tasty. The service was perfect, friendly and laid back."

   "I come here often with my friends for brunch. I love the egg white omelet. It's fluffy, delicious and very filling. The chefs do it right every time! I love the ambience here. Clean, fresh and a great way to start the weekend.",
   "Salut has great service and a big menu that can satisfy anyone. It\u2019s a fancy feeling restaurant with a local flair and the food is consistent and always has been good. The steak sandwich is one of the staples in my opinion but you can\u2019t really go wrong regardless of what you order.",
   "Haven't been  there for years, we just happened to be in the neighborhood,  glad we were, such great ambience,  waiter was very thoughtful, love being able to see into the kitchen. Feel at home. Looking forward to going back. Brunch looks like a good idea! Great cooks, very tasty. Thank you.",
   "First time at this fabulous find for lunch.  Driving down Grand looking for a place to stop we saw the word Salute so decided to take a chance and boy are we glad we did.  Cozy and inviting decor and very friendly staff.  A diverse but not overly large menu had something for everyone in our group. Seafood and chicken crepes and the burger which was one of the best ever plus a lovely bottle of wine made our day.  We will definitely be back and tell others of our find.",
   "Food was outstanding. The quality of the food is five stars and the presentation is also super. Service was very good - even though our server had a large party to take care of in addition to ours, she was on top of everything. The ambiance flexes easily, casual to formal.  And save room for dessert because it's a must!"

   "My husband took me here for my birthday last year. It was phenomenal. This is where I go when I want delicious sushi. I can't wait to be able to go in and sit down to eat when Covid-19 is done. For now I satisfy that craving with takeout.",
   "I come to this special place many times because I love the special air that is exist in this place. The team is exceptionally cordial and qualified. The service is extremely rapid. Needless to say, the food they prepare is highly distinguished. I ate there many times and I was always happy. The price is modest. I highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.",
   "Great ambiance. Professional service. Price is good. Food is tasty. Came here since it\u2019s close to the courthouse. I would recommend this to family and friends that are into sushi for sure.",
   "We LOVE the sushi at Sakura! The staff is very friendly, and the prices are reasonable. It's a great part of downtown Saint Paul, and I definitely think it is the best sushi in the area.",
   "I like this restaurant a lot. there is a romantic mood. The food is splendid. the service is dynamic and the waiters are trained. The price is satisfactory. I highly recommend."

   "This place is amazing. Best Chicken Parm and Lasagna you'll find around. Good prices, portions and quality. Would 100% recommend trying this out no matter how far of a drive it is. (bring cash, they don't take cards) I just ordered two Lasagnas for carry out, they were fantastic. If your tired of sitting at home during this time, go support a local place like this or call someone who will go pick it up for you!",
   "Great place to eat with that family/friendly atmosphere. Food portions are huge and well worth the price. Had the Gondola Boat with fries and a half basket of onion rings. Everything tasted great and fresh. Only downfall is they are cash only. Definitely will be back.",
   "This spot is super chill, and in cut but definitely worth while! They have great portion sizes, and the menu prices are also very reasonable.\n\nThe staff seemed nice, and the atmosphere of the place was relaxed, and welcoming...went in for a quick lunch with my coworkers....\n\nI had the Sunnies and Chips which was pretty good even though the fish was a little \u201cfishy\u201d there fries were also on point, and you get a hefty portion of them which is a bonus....only thing that could have made this meal better would have been a nice coleslaw on the side!  \n\nAlso the pizza is pretty lit (tasty) Get it well done!\n\nI\u2019ll def check out this spot again to try some more Italian choices from the menu!",
   "A top class restaurant! The standards and quality far surpass the price tag, in all honestly it\u2019s worth way more than what we were charged. All the waitstaff were great!",
   "First time there. Service was great. Not a white table cloth wine list kind of place but good red sauce and meatballs on spaghetti.  Definitely order the bread sticks made from their pizza dough. Awesome!"

   "This is the best new place I've been to in years. Don't let the location scare you off. In fact, I think it works for them. I had the Bi Bim Bop, one of their specialties. It was fantastic. Just the right spiciness.  Not scorching. Something for everyone. The servers were very welcoming also.",
   "Great breakfast! Their hidden secret in this dish is the fried (to perfection) rice ball under the egg. This was topped off with great service and a coffee level that wasn't allowed to reach the bottom of the mug by our server. Thanks!",
   "We met with friends at this restaurant for dinner. we heard about this restaurant from quite a few people.  Well, we were not disappointed. we were warmly welcomed by the crew  and we had an excellent feeling. The food was just great. We loved this restaurant a lot and we will visit this place again. Highly recommended.",
   "Delicious food. I like the food fusion flavors too! Korean with American dishes in one! Highly recommend",
   "Small, quaint place. Food was different but very good. A little too pricey for me especially for breakfast. I spent $66 before the tip for 3 people's breakfast. Service was super friendly and amazing. If it weren't for the cost, I would go there again."

   "Lots of great reasons to come here - easy to order, pleasant location, lots of natural light, and plenty of pizza options, including single slices. \nCrust is thin and crunchy, just how I like it. I prefer New York thin, where there is an equal amount of mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. Big River is more like St. Louis-Style pizza, where there is a higher proportion of cheese compared to tomato sauce.",
   "The food is awesome. The only thing they need is straws with paper wrapped around them. When you reach in to get the straws you touch too many at one time. Don't like germs.",
   "This spot is the one I like best. I go to plenty of restaurants but to this one I go the most. The crew is very professional and the food they place on your table is so flavorful. I would always prefer to have a good dinner in this place. I highly recommend this place.",
   "Favorite. Pizza. Ever. Of all time. Hands down. Like, if you ever want to experience something magical in your life, come here. The ingredients from the veggie pizza are from the farmers market. How much better can you get?! The unique selection (I recommend the garden pizza) sets it a part from any other pizza place you will go to. Best pizza place in MN. Fight me.",
   "The meals and service were beyond my expectations. We surely loved the atmosphere of this spot. Extraordinary spot to take the family out for lunch."
