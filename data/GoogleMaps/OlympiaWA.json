   "This is an interesting park with more than just a beautiful walk along the river. Don\u2019t miss the fish ladders, the bridge to a closer view of the historic brewery, and take a picnic so the kids can play hard at the playground. \nIf eating out is more your style you are in LUCK! Eat at The Falls Terrace restaurant, a local favorite. The views are impressive but the place is full of family charm. \nWhile this park is a great spot to bring your out of state company, it\u2019s a local favorite!\nThere\u2019s quite a bit of construction going on now so 4 stars- but when the trail is complete and other improvements done- I\u2019ll be back to update.",
   "Lots to look at here! There is a fish hatchery (still under construction) that will be amazing. Trails are well maintained and there is an area set aside for native plants. Informative kiosks add to the experience.",
   "I have always loved the falls, I have been taking my children there since they were babies, they are now 36 and down. I absolutely love the new upcoming  improvements, so excited for the new fish hatchery!  That will be so fascinating and exciting to watch!",
   "Any time of year, Tumwater Falls is a wonderful place for a walk.  Today, even with the salmon gone and extensive construction going on, my guests and I still enjoyed the fabulous beauty of the Falls, with the moss covered rocks, which are like sculpture from years of tumbling water.  My (grown) daughter and I have even decided to come  every 3 months, each time she visits.  We love it that much.\n\nAnd during the salmon run, it's an unforgettable experience - like my first time there.  :~]",
   "This place is so nice to go to always. I really love waterfalls, just something about them is so soothing. It's a great place to take senior photos or prom photos. The trails they have their are nice as well."

   "Excellent trail network. Well maintained and only a couple of places that get steep, but stairs are there to keep footing even. In general a bit technical and easy/medium difficulty.\n\nMany interesting sights to see in this park: bridges, a bay, birds.",
   "We always love walking the trails at Priest Point with Buddha (our Springer Spaniel)! Always find them in great condition and well manicured, plus, definitely some of the best sunset views around!",
   "Loved the trails and the size in general, it's beautiful and there's so much to do. Bring your kids to play at the play area, have a birthday party play at the beach area hike with your dog or s/o .... It's one of my favorite parks of Olympia period",
   "Great trails for all levels of hiking or just plain walking. There are trails on both sides of the bridge that you can cross over to. Wish there were more documented trails but if you got the time go take an adventure."

I'm glad I did, and if you come, you will enjoy a nice walk, stunning views of the water (I bet it's even better with better weather), and that marvelous feel of being by the sea. So many boats moored here, I got some great pictures. I'll come back, for sure.",

   "So much stuff to do! I don't think kids will ever want to leave! The activities are educational, great for a field trip. There are many activities that use imaginations, such as the \"food\" area where there is plastic foods that you can \"cook.\" I recommend going here.",
   "Awesome place to bring kids of all ages. There is always some educational activity going on. It can get pretty busy and crowded on event days so its good to get there earlier or later, but not at the peak times on weekends. Parking in the back can get a little crazy. There is so much to do and even a few water based activities. When the weather is warm, there's a bunch of outside areas set up too.",
   "This is really a neat learning environment for kids of all ages. We were happy to get a membership after our initial visit, but have regretted getting it ever since. Here's why: The problem is they have no limit on capacity numbers and it often gets way too overcrowded to enjoy anything. It basically becomes a Hunger Games-esque environment where it's every kid for themselves and they have to fight to get to explore anything. Additionally, there are several exhibits that don't have working buttons or fully functioning displays. Makes it quite disappointing. What are we paying for? Lastly, they never turn away visibly sick children! So, until they decide to monitor their capacity levels, fix ALL the broken buttons & displays, and refuse entry to visibly sick children we won't be back.",
   "This place is a wonderful museum in WA. It blows away the Seattle and Bellevue ones as well. The team is constantly cleaning and tidying up play areas to help keep the experience meaningful for the kids. Beautiful outdoor play area as well and a great cafe. Lots of parking too. The membership is worth it.",
   "My children spent a few good hours loving the fun filled adventures this facility had in store for them. Much fun. Many recommends. A"

The walking bridge is beautiful and runs parallel to the old railway bridge. \n\nIn springtime at night you can enjoy the local brown bag population.",

There is lots of room to sit down on all the grass lawns, and there is a beautiful fountain. I highly recommend checking out this place if you're visiting the area, you won't regret it! Super fascinating.",
   "Thank you, for giving me hope! Beyond the untruths and slanderous guessing, I have met you. Up close and personal I have learned about character that earned you stay in this place. The love of America, strength in a united family, and humility endures. Faithfulness to our higher power also makes you my neighbor. Thank you, for helping build a future for us all.\n\n+ The benefits from time in a conservatory greenhouse helps!",

The free tour was great and the tour guide very very knowledgeable! And of course the architecture inside the building was beautiful. A must see if you\u2019re around the area!",
   "The Capitol building is a short walk from the visitor center parking lot. Very welcoming personnel and docents enhanced the visit. The extensive use of marble from five countries is astounding. Our docent was a former educator and extremely knowledgeable. Although there weren\u2019t any sessions underway, we enjoyed seeing the areas and learning more about government processes. The rotunda and the unique Tiffany chandeliers are exquisite. Even if you don\u2019t \u201cneed to go\u201d, go into one of the restrooms for more marble craftsmanship. If you\u2019re able, take the stairs for even more. There is a small cafeteria where you can get a beverage and food, but it is also used by employees. We went in late morning for a beverage before our tour but decided to pass due to the wait and our approaching tour time. I can imagine that during lunch, you might have a wait because many menu items are prepared as they are ordered. Fortunate for us, we visited on Potato Day. Staff and visitors were treated in the rotunda to complementary baked potatoes with numerous toppings to choose from plus beverages. We were told that the following day would be Ice Cream Day. Although there were four adults and no children on my guided tour, I did see materials designed for children and got a sense that the tour could easily be adapted to interest them"

Hire a guard or rent a cop to walk the grounds, fix the damn benches (seriously!) and keep the place tidy.

The other section has much bigger big toys. I like the new stuff they put in it. Love the musical toys, it's so creative. They have lots of trails that you can walk through that all connect to each section. They also have a paved trail that connects the two park sections to each other. They have a tennis court. They have a full on basketball court at the bigger section. They have picnic table areas for eating. They have a covered area for eating like if you want to have a big group there. This is one of my favorite parks and always holds wonderful memories for me.",

   "This was the first home built in Washington that was not a log cabin. It was built by Harvard alum, Daniel Bigelow around 1852 after he arrived in the area by crossing the Oregon Trail. After he married, he and his wife had 8 children and hosted a few important historical figures such as Susan B. Anthony. Mrs. Bigelow was very active in the women's suffrage movement. The house was added onto during the several years it remained in the Bigelow family or 1994. It became a state house museum shortly before that even when the last of the family was living there. Cheryl, our docent, was extremely knowledgeable and thorough. The tour lasts about an hour and is well worth the time. They only ask for donations; there is no set entrance fee.",

I came away feeling very proud of this part of the family too!! They sound much like my side of the clan too...and it is a very well preserved place compared to others of like age we have seen in recent years. Highly recommend a visit here.",
   "Great place to learn about early Olympia Washington."

   "This place is awesome! Perfect for toddlers on a hot day. Feels like being at a real stream, without any of the danger! There\u2019s even bathrooms nearby, and a security guard who walks the perimeter. The way it\u2019s landscaped, you really don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the middle of the city. And right next door to an awesome children\u2019s museum if you need something else to do! Wish you could park longer than 3 hrs on the street though. :(",
   "It's nice, but the white haired elderly security guard is a jerk and will stare you down and follow you around like a criminal if you have a vape in your pocket. He gave me the creeps, wasn't doing anything wrong. Didn't vape around kids. +the kids museum was closed already and no kids around. Be warned the vape police will be on your tail if you have one.\n\nAnd for the record, there were no signs anywhere in this plaza saying that you could not smoke or vape there. So if that's the rule they need to get some damn signs saying so."

I love that they have a squishy rubber type floor under the play equipment. I don't worry as much about my daughter falling or tripping as I would with rocks or bark. The play equipment is appropriate for a large age range as well which is great. Many parks cater to either younger or older kids it seems and have little of one or the other.\n\n I have many great memories here. Though it is small, it is nice. There is however occasionally someone smoking pot or cigarettes too near the play area which isn't cool. That is never really a problem, though since we could always go explore the trees and stone structure off to the side.",

The grass is well kept and the squirrels are entertaining to watch. The only downfall is the traffic around it and the number of people that set up camp there for various reasons (although they tend to keep to themselves, it can be a bit crowded at times). From time to time, they have small events there at the gazebo in the center of the park which are amusing to attend, although parking can be scarce so be ready for a short jaunt from your car to get to the park."

   "There are a couple of things, like a rock to climb, for my older kids and they still have stuff for my babies!",

   "This is a real centerpiece of the neighborhood. I remember growing up playing YMCA sports on these fields as a kid and now I'm seeing people my age with their own kids playing around on those same fields. It's kept up pretty well by the city. Has a nice playground for kids to mess around on and a covered bench area for a picnic or even a birthday party in the summer!",
   "Cute little neighborhood park in a great community. A fun playground for different developmental levels, a mini spray area to keep cool on hot days, tennis court, basketball hoop, a little baseball field and covered picnic area as well as quite a few picnic tables dispersed.",
   "Lions park is a nice little spot to hang out and have a picnic. The facilities in this park include permanent restrooms, a covered area with tables, a fenced tennis court and parking."

   "I took my 4 grandchildren ages 12 to 5.  The walk was easy and we saw so many plants, berries, flowers, trees.  The kids loved the quiet.  They particularly liked finding the water.",
   "I enjoyed this excellent urban ramble in the woods. The beginning and end of the mile and a half Loop trail is an open Prairie. The remainder of it was Forest and it was beautiful. I was there on a beautiful cloudless day birding and enjoyed the cool cover of the forest canopy. I didn't get a look at the lake nearby, but the underbrush was pretty thick and I couldn't maneuver and close enough.",
   "It's a beautiful clean park. Great for dog walks",
   "It was beautiful aside from the pile of old bones at the beginning of the trail. If they have history I would like an informational plaque stating such. If it's illegal or unsafe I would like it removed. The lack of trail markers also confuses me it feels like I might walk into someone's backyard.",
   "Quick loop takes less than half hour to walk. Very flat. The forest if pleasant and feels secluded. No major views of the water as there is no real shoreline. However there are places you can see it if you follow some of the side trails. It's a good place to run in the summer. During winter the exposed tree roots are a bit hazerdous for running, at least for me."

Trails cut through the woods and follow some of the tributaries as they cut through the woods heading out to the sound. See this park on high tide and low tide as the experience is a little different for each!",
   "Been here thousands of times. Trails are well kept, however beware of mud after rains. Beach access is easy and close to parking. Definitely worth the Discover Pass.",
   "Horrible atmosphere! Barking dogs everywhere, ready to attack each other. So unpleasant, especially when looking for a tranquil getaway with kids. Did not feel safe or relaxed. What a shame, bc the nature is beautiful",
   "One of my favorite places in the world. Beautiful beach. I almost always find sand dollars and oysters. Seen bald eagles. The hiking trails make you feel like you're walking in Jurassic park!",

   "once you pay the parking fee at the kiosk, turn left and you have a choice of going on the raised walkway through the marshes, to the right at the fork. Or continue on and go left and find the gravel road way. This is good choice if you want to quickly get out to view the Puget sound.\n\nIt was such a beautiful clear day that we could see all the way to Olympic national Park and Mount Olympus in the distance.\n\nSerios photographers were out in droves on a beautiful day, with their large camera lenses, so it really is a great place for photography.  We saw a young little green frog scoot across the roadway and it seem to be learning how to jump.  Tons of geese seemed to be returning, and we enjoyed watching them land on the water. \n\nAll of this and we were only there for 45 minutes. We will definitely be back!  Great place to visit rain or shine if you are a nature lover for photographer.  Easy walk most of the way.  Probably not easy for wheelchairs because both the walkways and the gravel road are bumpy.",
   "A boardwalk that extends a mile into the estuary of the Nisqually River, set aside for gorgeous, sundry wildlife...  OF COURSE it's as amazing as it sounds!!\n\nThis place is just an incredible gift, easy to navigate, and great for all walking skill levels.  If you need a place to remember the peace and beauty of nature not too far away, this will not disappoint.",
   "Awesome walk! Great for bird watchers. A bearing pair of bald eagles flew over my party several times very closely! We had a wonderful time.",
   "Wow, lived here 10 years and our first time stopping here. Amazing place to walk and see birds, ducks, and possibly salmon on the nisqually river. The boardwalk loop is huge, also tons of other trails to do. Can easily spend half a day here.",
   "I love this place. It's so peaceful and has lots of great places for walking. Great place to take kids for walks. I love seeing all the different birds that live and migrate here."

Plenty of shade, and the bathrooms are kept clean.  Additional parking is available (except on Sundays) at the church next to the park.  Great place to just sit back and relax in the shade too.  If you are into games like PoGo or WU, this is a good spot with a gym/fort and plenty of stops/inns!",

That being the first splash park in Olympia, it gets busy fast. Also parking kind of sucks a bit...but mostly due to the lack of it. All in all a nice place to cool down.",

We had a full group of 10 and we all came together after reading the novel The Highest Tide by Jim Lynch which was set in the Nisqually Delta.

Our guide took his time to get us up close to the wildlife; we saw lots of baby seals, eagles, and other cool birds.

Cell service is spotty but has improved these past few years. But that\u2019s good because camping isn\u2019t about being on your phone, it\u2019s about being in nature and with the people you love. Our family has been coming here every single year for almost 40 years now. It\u2019s known as Deep Lake to us because my grandparents started going to the Deep Lake Resort next door. Rangers are friendly and helpful. Reservations available online, book early because they fill up quick! They have showers and bathrooms accessible in multiple different spots around the grounds. They also have picnic tables and kitchens near the beaches. I just love this place with my whole heart.",
   "Rented the Environmental Learning Center for a group event...fantastic facilities and great support from the rangers and staff. Best equipped kitchen we've used at any park or other event space - top-notch with walk-in cooler, convection ovens, and Hobart dishwasher. Made our food prep and serving a breeze! The cabins are tiny but toasty warm, and the showers are totally reasonable for a camp. Highly recommended for large-ish (75-80 person) groups.",

Dressed in a suit he was head of security . So when I go it reminds me of him when he was well and that alone is worth going. However I also love to game there all my favorite slots are under that roof! Including copper dropper , stinking rich and the money machine ! Yet to hit any jackpot but I still enjoy the atmosphere it gets very busy and although it's goood for business its less fun for the player looking to okay their favorite machine .",

The Red Wind changed the way they give out rewards to loyal customers.

   "Nice neighborhood park with some unique toys. Kids really enjoyed it here. Also had a nice paved walk for walking, bikes, scooters. Paved path does have hills.",
   "Great park. Tumwater takes such good care of their parks.",
   "Nice quiet neighborhood park great for a dog walk. Only downside is no public restroom. Very pretty and relaxing some fun little paths through a small wooded area up by the neighborhood entrance. Love it here!",
   "Epic place to hang out with friends after going to 7/11"

   "What a surprising delight! Had no idea this was so close to home, been sharing it with all of my friends, coworkers and customers. It's a wonderful place filled with a lot of emotion (if you're with an artist mindset). It's incredible, everyone has asked me where these photos are from and what the story is behind it. I'd love more details for each piece to understand the perception of the artist but I have no problem coming up with my own. Love this place and will definitely come back!",
   "Was free and very interesting sculptures. Think I missed some of the park, but was there for a couple hours looking around. Was awesome random find. Definitely a diamond in the rough!",
   "Great stop along the Western Chehalis trail. Parking for bikes or cars, porta potty and complimentary water. Nice walking trail through the park but could be difficult for strollers, walkers or wheelchairs as the trails are not paved and there are areas with incline. Great place for a picnic, they have picnic tables scattered throughout. The scenery and setting in the natural environment is just as beautiful as any of the sculptures.  The butterfly maze was not open as of memorial day 2019, but should be in July.  It is free to visit, but you should leave a donation to support this wonderful park.",
   "One of the coolest places I've been in Washington, it is way larger than I thought it was going to be! All of the art and sculptures are amazing, definitely worth checking out! I'll be back soon without a doubt",
   "What a cool place. Thank you so much for your passion and openness. The world is a better place for having this place."

   "What a lovely place! Sit in a beautiful rose garden on a comfy couch with your wine samples! Wow! You won't regret stopping here for a taste of their tasty wines. I especially liked their Stagecoach mix ( a robust red) Look at the pix, their bar and bar back are exquisite wooden pieces brought from England, it's worth stopping just to see the place even if you don't drink wine! And the proprietor is a delight as well, genuinely friendly, she loves what she does and it shows.",
   "About a month ago three of us paid a visit to this wonderful winery, this my second visit. They only make red wines which I appreciate because a small winery can't, in my opinion, produce fantastic wines if they try to make too many varietals. The ambiance is quite unique with a very friendly staff, contributing to an extremely enjoyable visit."

We brought his balance bike, and it is flat enough that I don't have to worry, but still has lots of small dips here and there for him to go downhill and practice risk taking. I kind of like that there are no trees because I can see everything, who's coming down the trail, animals, etc. It feels very safe for this mom of 2 hiking without Dad around.",

   "Great place to visit with kids! Easy to get around with a nice paved pathway.",

Fourth floor stained glass, surrounded by uncovered brick and stone materials; 3. First floor documents' vault (now an office); 4. Intricate architectural details throughout their multiple floors.",

I liked that they also carry a locally made tonic syrup and sipping vinegars (these were fascinating to try!). I also enjoyed how everything had a story and they weren't shy about telling those stories. Especially enjoyable: all of the ingredients are locally sourced, their processes are all very environmentally friendly, and even the spent grains have a useful home.\n\nI'd highly recommend this if you have a couple of hours to spare; get the tour, try some tasty booze, support a local business! Win/win for everyone.",

   "We had an awesome experience as \u2018Distillers for the Day\u2019 with John, Justin and Randy st Sandstone. From grain to gulp, we were hands on in every step of the process working alongside the distillers and truly emerging ourselves in the science and sweat equity of craft distilling. It was fun, interesting, active and we had a lot of laughs along the way. I highly recommend Sandstone. Heart and hustle goes into everything they produce with a true local, sustainable and artisan theme throughout every drop of the final bounty!  The bacon whiskey is to die for!",

Can be a bit muddy, especially after rain, so be sure to bring your rough shoes.\nThis trail isn't a loop trail, but rather a hike-in hike-out-the-way-you-came type trail. Once you get to the end however it's great. Great history and a great view of the Puget Sound. Be sure though to stay off the big tracks at the end of the trail that run over the tunnel. These are very very active rails and high speed passenger trains use these tracks so be careful.",
   "Nice walk, maybe takes 20 minutes, perfect length for an afternoon picnic. Love all the train stuff and seeing the trains come by. Nice Pebble Beach to enjoy. Not much shade to be found at the beach. Nice little girl scape not to far from Lakewood, will be my new go to picnic spot.",
   "Short, wide, well worn, partially paved 1.5 mile trail through an evergreen forest, skirting a small creek and ending at the sound. Its fairly busy, you can expect to run into at least 5 or 6 other groups, possibly with on or off leash dogs. Occasionally requires a skip hop over muddy patches. Mostly level, but generally felt like it has a slow decline going out, and the obvious reciprocal incline going back. Good for a 1 to 5 mile run.",
   "Good 3 mile round trip out and back. Pet friendly. Partially paved but mostly unpaved. We did ok with a big tire stroller. The water views are amazing once you get to the end. Minus one star for no clearly accessible public restrooms we could see.",
   "Nice shorter hike, 1.5 miles to the water, just under the bridge, 3 mile round trip total. The path is part hard ball and part gravel but in good condition. The view at the end point is spectacular, and there is plenty of space along the beach there to walk, salvage, or just hang out. City Hall and the police/fire station is at the trail head if you need to use the bathroom or have an emergency. There is plenty of space to park in the field across the street if the lot ends up being full. Overall nice little hike and getting to learn a bit of local history via the signage they put up is a bonus"

   "High Quality Takeout. During the virus restaurant shutdown order, I wanted to have a special dinner with my sweetie but was stymied until I heard Dockside Bistro was doing takeout, and what great takeout it is! I went to the website, looked at the menu and called in an order. The person who took the order was friendly and helpful. When I picked it up I was glad to see I could get it at the window on the boardwalk so did not need to go in. Laurie  greeted us pleasantly. I've been there before and felt good knowing the place is always super clean, and now it's even cleaner. As she brought out the order she cleaned her hands with bleach wipes and even had a clean pen to sign with, which then went in the used pens glass! The food was tasty, healthy, and beautifully presented, not your average takeout. (The fish tacos are awesome.) It wasn't cheap, but it was worth it. We took it home and had our special dinner on the patio. The only downside is that it took her longer than I expected to assemble the food and put together the bill, but, again, it was worth it.",
   "Slightly under seasoned... the duck and the stone crab soup were under seasoned and therefore underwhelming. \n\nHalibut was excellent.  \n\nOverall the meal was good, but not great. Certainly not the 5 star ravings you see on here.",
   "Best food I've ever had in my life. Those tea smoked scallops made me cry. Romantic but comfortable, excellent lighting, thoughtful service. I see you Olympia! We will be back.",
   "Picked-up items from their special menu (during pandemic/social distancing closure) and enjoyed some outstanding Dungeness Crab Chowder, Goat Cheese Salad & Lemongrass Chicken Skewers. While a wee bit pricey, you'd be hard pressed to find \"take out\" of this caliber anywhere else in town. YUM!!",
   "Very nice restaurant with a view of the harbor. Had the Elk which was very good. Parking was easy for the time we were there."

   "Little Italy in Olympia! Such a gem in food quality and presentation. Staff went above and beyond to accommodate our large party.  Large gluten-free selection and gluten-free bread for appetizers. Delicious pasta with vegetarian and vegan options available. Highly recommend.",
   "Authentic Italian food and lot of vegetarian and vegan options. Great selection of wine too.",
   "Celebrated our 1 year anniversary dinner at Basilico. Alexis was our server, she was awesome and the food and drinks were suburb.  Will definitely return and try other menu options.",
   "I can't recommend this place highly enough. I have eaten there twice and I have no idea why it hasn't been a lot more. The staff was very friendly. The food was amazing, the tomato bisque was probably the tastiest soup I have ever had. The meals we had were all very delicious and for dessert we had a chocolate mousse that I will be dreaming about for weeks.",
   "We have been to Basilico half a dozen times or more and each time it's been an amazing experience. This time we did the Discover Basilico 4 course experience. We had a full meal for leftovers tomorrow and the food was amazing! It gave us an opportunity to try 3 appetizers, 3 pastas, 2 entrees and 3 desserts. The entire experience was so amazing and the food was fabulous!! My husband ordered his favorite and he wasn't disappointed! This is the best Italian restaurant I'm WA state. My husband is Italian and he loves this place."

   "One can see why this place is highly regarded by the locals. Hospitality is above all among the best. From hostess to server. . . the attention to our meal' s enjoyment was obviously important. Relaxing marina view \u26f5 in the twilight hour along with good mix of music \ud83c\udfb6 genre playing in the background made for an enjoyable meal. \n          Costs are as expected of a marina location $$$ although not upscale since linen was napkin only no t-cloth. Bread/rolls was actually a part of the meal no extra charge ... wow that's old school classy. Food flavors were acceptable but nothing that stands out as different or original. However, each plate and appetizer ordered was served hot rather than just warm... meaning wait staff was on point. Lots of cheery folks warranting a return visit.",
   "We went to celebrate my fiance's birthday.  We had one of the best nights we've had in quite a while.  Everything from the appetizers to dessert was amazing.  We started during happy hour and the prices were very fair.  The food came out very fast and our server Trina was amazing",
   "I was in the area and i happen to google king crab eating. \nWell, this restaurant popped up, and after an hr or two spent on just  online researching and reading reviews overall on restaurants , seafood restaurant.\nI decide to go with this one. Very good food. Half a pound of king crab,  wanted to try the Dungeness crab .  They only had it served with salad. Or like a cocktail . Very good clam chowder and delicious oysters shots.\nAll and all, pretty good.\n\nBut now I'm going to the red wing casino for their buffet!",
   "FABULOUS dinner and awesome wait staff, Julia. A real sweetheart. Very thoughtful and caring. I was celebrating my birthday with a friend but I was pretty uncomfortable after a medical procedure earlier in the afternoon. She even brought me ice in a bag to alleviate some pain. Thank you.",
   "This place was so good we ate here back to back. ONE thing to note. SKIP The \u201cjumbo shrimp cocktail\u201d for $10 - they are not jumbo at all. Your better off ordering the shrimp scampi, as it\u2019s like $16, you get way more food and the shrimp were the same size if not bigger. \nSo delicious. The blackened salmon was amazing. Loaded baked potato. Yum!  Bread to start. Friendly service. Great dinner."

We found the perfect bottle of wine on the wine rack up front so I recommend checking if you are a wine person :) Perfect lighting. Perfect music. Perfect.... Everything. I reserved a month in advance for Valentine's day and all that was available was 8pm. Regardless of what was surely a long night for everyone we were treated like the first customers of the night. Seating was right on time. We didn't feel rushed at all and we enjoyed a truly exceptional dinner. Kudos, Gardner's, you clearly have this figured out!",
   "Great ambiance,food and service.  Very romantic but comfortable atmosphere. We went for our anniversary dinner and they sent a candle with the dessert we ordered along with a card signed by the staff\ud83d\udc97",
   "Fantastic meal! \n We haven't been here for a number of years so we decided to give them a shot... great choice! The ambience was lovely, the service was attentive but not overbearing and the food was terrific! We had the charcuterie appetizer which was a lovely mix of meat, cheese, fruit and veggies served with soft, warm pita triangles just slightly browned. Plentiful but not so much that it spoiled our appetite for our entrees. \n My wife had the pasta special, ravioli with Italian sausage and a ricotta/ goat cheese filling in a nice light but bright tomato sauce,  delightful. I had the scallop special and it was wonderful, four plump, perfectly prepared jumbo scallops served over a sweet potato puree that was really well done.  Dessert was a shared (huge) piece of dark chocolate layer cake with cream cheese frosting..yum!\n Thanks for seating us after a short wait without a reservation, we were lucky they were quite busy. I strongly recommend calling ahead and ensuring your spot here!",

We ate from the 3 for $25 menu and were pleasantly surprised by flavor and portion size. My students loved the lemonade. The calamari was a hit. The smoked.salmon dip comes with apple slices and was recommended. Ahi nachos were delightful. The Caesar salad was crisp and refreshing. I had a med rare sirloin and it melted in my mouth. Will definitely be back again.",

   "I couldn't believe how perfect it all was! The mellow water view, the literally PERFECT service, and the just-as-perfect food made it one of my best dining experiences in years! We traded bites and - except for the vegetarian not tasting the hamburger - had to just share it all, because we all wanted everything. I can't say enough about how amazing it was! It's not cheap - we spent $40 apiece - but we had an experience of perfection we'll remember for years...",
   "The complimentary bread was great.\nThe Wasabi sauce on the ahi nacho was delicious\nThe four course steak was charred on the outside with little to no flavor\nThe award winning clam chowder wasn't flavourful, it makes me wonder what year was the award given? \nService was mediocre, after the entree, the server didn't come to ask about our choice of dessert\nThe floor was wet with no \"wet floor\" sign"

You can over indulge in this pizza without getting a stomach ache because of the natural ingredients. My new favorite restaurant!",
   "Our family of 3 enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  The service was a little off as we had to flag down servers for water, refills, and a kid color sheet that was mentioned/promised to our kiddo.  Pizza was our very quickly once we were able to place our order.  It was tasty and crust was thin (if that\u2019s you\u2019re preference).  We had a kid-friendly pepperoni and ham but there were lots of other fun options on the menu. Price was reasonable.  Atmosphere was very nice.  Street parking, only.",
   "My favorite place in Olympia, Tumwater, Lacey area. The staff is welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The pizza is fresh, hot, and delicious. The wine is poured generously and the ambiance is set effortlessly.  The owner and employees have successfully brought a piece of Italy to the streets of Olympia, WA. This is my home away from home.",
   "We went here for Valentines dinner.  We have been here a few times before and our visits have always been 4-5 stars.  They make delicious pizzas, salads, and pastas using organic food. They also offer many things that are not very common, like organic mushrooms, truffle oil, and delicious blue cheese.  This time we had a very nice antipasto board.  As usual, the management or owner is present and conversing with the customers. One negative, is their price seems to be rising rather quickly.  I realize their food is of a very fine quality, but their prices are what we would consider to be high for the area.  For the two of us, which included two wine glasses, a half antipasto board, two main pasta dishes, and a take out dish... Was almost $120.  This is high quality food, but I hope La Gitana doesnt price themselves out of business.",
   "I have missed Italian pizza since I was in Italy. Eating here is the closest I can get and it is incredible! The staff are friendly, the owners are great and the food delicious. I love their pizzas, the salad and just tried their pasta which was equally impressive. The environment is lovely and on some days they have live music which just adds to the overall feel!"

   "Two words delicious and accommodating. We have serious allergies in my family so finding restaurants can be difficult. So after reading a few good yelp reviews we decided to cross our Fingers and see what the Iron Rabbit had to offer. Right off the bat we were able to talk to the manager about allergies and it all worked out. Everything was handled with care and the results were delicious. My two recommendations are the drunken sailor and the chicken cordon who. Not only was the food great but also the building was nice too. It had a quaint hometown feel and had clean bathrooms. I would definitely recommend stopping by.",
   "I was on my way out of town and wanted to splurge on dinner so I decided to go here since it was in my list of restaurants to visit. I figured it would be a bit pricey since they don't have prices listed on the menu on their website. \n\nOverall the prices weren't too bad. I got the buffalo cauliflower to start with and it was amazing!!  Spicy and sweet with delicious chunky blue cheese dressing on the side. \n\nFor my main course I opted to get the Wagyu Top steak instead of a burger but I wish I hadn't. For $32.00 it was very disappointing. It didn't have much flavor, was really dry and also over cooked. I asked for medium, hoping for some pink, but it was more medium well to well.  \n\nMy service was good, the guy who took care of me was friendly and attentive but after he dropped off the steak he never came back to ask how it was or else I would have told him it was too dry and over cooked. In the end I just checked it up to being part of the adventure of exploring new restaurants while on vacation.  I will add that thw mashed potatoes were really good too!",
   "I had the seafood linguine & my wife had the drunken sailor.  Both excellent meals.  Why the 3 stars?  The deserts were horrible.  I had the bread pudding.  The back side had a burnt taste & the rest was too stiff & not \"pudding \" at all.  My wife had the chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  All raspberry, including seeds, with chocolate syrup spread around as garnish.  She was so disappointed.  We both had coffee & for $4.25 per, it was sad for coffee.  We'd go back for the entrees only if we were really in the mood.  Recommend skip their dessert & coffee.  Expensive mistake.",
   "The service is very good. Very friendly staff. Good for family's or alone. They have a fantastic homemade ginger ale and root beer that was very tasty. I had the unbeatable burger and the comdoments were very tasty. The vegetarian beet burger was dry and underwhelming. My companion had the fish and chips and they said it was serviceable. I'd go back for the drinks."

   "Wow, the meal was amazing! We had no idea what to expect, from a price or quality standpoint. Fair warning- Specials can be a bit pricey ($30-$35 )for the Olympia area but entrees ran a little lower cost. \nEverything we had was delicious. I had a sampler of 3 kinds of meat and it was fantastic. There were no leftovers. My wife had a more standard dish that utilized a sauce that came with mine; Iskender something.\nDecor is as expected, Turkish themed but not overbearing. The room is very spacious and the layout looked like it could accommodate larger groups as well.",
   "Nice presentation,service was less than acceptable.  Server disappeared and we never got refills of our coffee or tea and had to ask another waiter if we could have our bill. However the food was good and the one Turkish  coffee I received and the one Turkish tea my friend received was amazing, wish we could have ordered more."

Then to top it off, she asked if I would like a complimentary desert for my celebration! I told her I was full but would love a chocolate martini!

I think the rainbow was a unique addition, but...it was unique!  Good food.  Went during the \"lunch\" menu so it was perfect for smaller eaters. I had the salmon and she had the roasted chicken (roasted on the spit) salad.  I wouldn't say the ambience is \"cozy\" but it's very nice and on clear days you can see the Olympic Mts.\n\nAs someone else said it's a nice place to take guests.\n\nEven got to watch a Dragon Boat crew work out!",

Also a must have is the clam chowder and steamer clams.I highly recommend everyone try this place. More then just seafood as well here.",

The oysters were amazing each pair  was a different experience.My wife had a lavender drop which she loved so much she had two! I tried a beer called black mountain it was delicious. For our entrees we had the shrimp and grits and the Mac and cheese with added crab. The only thing we would change was the cold crab on top of the mac and cheese outside of that this place was great! The restaurant was beautiful and the staff was very attentive. We will definitely be back to try the brunch and dinner menus. Thank you for a wonderful lunch!",

Lauren was super knowledgeable about the entire menu and extremely friendly.  All in all an incredible experience! Would definitely  recommend and will for sure be returning.",
   "Every time I come to this restaurant, I'm filled with so much joy because I know that I'm in for an absolute treat. With the new opening of their extended restaurant area, I love sitting at the bar and watching them shuck the oysters and create beautiful plates full of yummy treats. Even my husband, who isn't huge on seafood, finds yummy things to eat here.",
   "Delicious food and cocktails, reasonably priced - in a modern, light, sophisticated space.  We ordered every oyster on the menu (about 10 varieties listed with origin & tasting notes).  We were in shellfish heaven.  Look for their daily happy hour - called something like \"Shucker's Call\" for $3 oysters.\nThen came their fabulous clam chowder.  This is a more modern, light take on chowder. Not too heavy on the cream with the freshest clams, pork belly and potatoes.  Soul satisfying.\nThe airy space has large windows, with gray & white decor, mostly spare with a touch of whimsy.\nParking is easy - there is an adjacent parking lot for the entire complex and ample street spaces."

   "Great views and delicious food!  Was recently here for a computer gaming event and had breakfasts both days!   \n\nCountry Fried Steak with Eggs and the Biscuits and Gravy.  \n\nGood flavor \ud83d\udc4c Just wish they had hash browns! \ud83d\ude01\n\nOn the nightside of the things, I ordered an adult Almond Joy shake.   It was tasty, just wished it had a little more punch to it.  \ud83d\ude09\n\nLove coming here and looking forward to visiting again!",
   "Been coming here for years with a LAN renting the downstairs and sometimes on our own. Every time the drinks, food, and service have been exemplary. Breakfast, the clam chowder, everything is awesome. You can't beat the view and you owe it to yourself to visit, especially since it's a little off the beaten path (a big plus).\nGet some friends together and come to have some fun and maybe even try the Barge Burger. The biggest burger you've ever seen!",
   "Great views.  Good food.  Humble & Casual.  Amazing location to take a little break from it all.  Attentive folks and some innovative takes on classic American fare.  Honestly, one of my wife's favorite places here in the Olympia area.",
   "Hubby and I went to lunch at Tugboat Annie's! Was delicious! The crab and artichoke dip appetizer was yummy! I loved my shrimp and chips, and hubby  enjoyed his clam and chips basket! The service was the Best! Can't wait to go again. We will make it one of our favorite spots! I look forward to seeing what the harbor looks like at night! What a cool place!\ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udc1a\ud83d\udc33",
   "Great place for a meal! The food was yummy and well priced.  They have a kids meal and my son had the grilled cheese.  I had the shrimp and my husband had the pulled pork, both were great.  Server was very friendly.  Super busy at dinner time but had plenty of parking and lots of tables/seating.  They have option to sit outside as well.  Great views all around the outside of the restaurant."

   "Old school is classic Olympia pizza eats. Buy by the slice or whole pizzas. Lots of fun decor on the walls. Sometimes nice staff sometimes a bit on the cold side, but it doesn't alter my experience. I love their pizza, they're one of the best in town.",
   "It's the best NYC style pizza in Olympia. Real thin crust, nice stretchy cheese and a good flavor to the sauce without being overpowering. If you like the sauce a bit more punchy, you can add parmesan, oregano, and red peppers. I find it perfect, maybe just a little shy in sauce flavor. It's not burned, but it gets a good char in a few spots like you see in my pics. The atmosphere is, well, old school. They nailed it perfectly, even down to the rad old school video games. If you're in your 40's and 50's, you'll probably love the place and feel at home. I love it. The music is loud, so this isn't the joint for a business meeting or romantic evening alone.",
   "This place is a breath of fresh air. I feel like a kid again. Endless drinks. Food is great. I had 2 slices of pepperoni. Lots of attention to detail. This place is a must visit!",
   "My childhood all in one bite. Use to go to this place all the time growing up in Olympia. Very happy to come back 10 years later and see it still up and doing well!! Serving out the best pizza like I remember back as a kid! Try their thick slice pizzas it was so yummy. \nJust came up from Portland on my way to Seattle and we had to stop for pizza. And I think I am going to have to stop again on the back home! My fave pizza place! Love the 80's vibe its got with rock and roll posters and old writing all over the walls. Cool music playing. Great vibes all around.",
   "I went 3 years ago when my son and his family lived there. They recommended it and I was not disappointed. Very tasty pizza and great selection of local beers. Cool and quirky place that I would definitely go back to next time I'm in the area."

The portions, however, were way too large. To-go boxes were necessary for everyone and it encouraged me to eat way too much all at once. I definitely will come back to try more.",
   "So incredibly delicious! Plus they can customize any dish, do half orders, customize your spice level etc. I ordered the Singapore noodle and it was SO good! Will definitely order it again and again."

The food and service is very consistent.\nThe best value is the Kitchen Dinner served Sunday through Thursday 5 to close for $25. It's a 3 course meal with a good variety of choices for appetizers, entrees and dessert. \nHappy hour is 3 to 5 daily. \nI have personally had the pork tenderloin, the ravioli, the penne, and the the tagliatelle and all were excellent. The pear and Gorgonzola salad is very good.",

Service was perfect, prompt, professional and knowledgable.  They also have happy hour from 3 to 5 every day. We will be back to try the kitchen dinner 3 course meal.",

   "I\u2019ve been here for quite a few team dinners. I like their cocktail options. It\u2019s just that they have very limited vegetarian options. It\u2019d be great if they can accommodate that in their menu."

It was half gone by the time I could take the shot.\nWe had a great time with only two pieces left.\nWhen I asked for foil for the two pieces, the server asked if it was going to be a late night snack. I told him that I'm a homeless advocate and the leftover was going to a man who has eaten virtually nothing but ramen for the last week.\nB4 we left, the server gave us a \"mistake\" to add to the food we were handing out.\nSo instead of feeding one, we feed three.",

The \"3D pizza\" is a pseudo Chicago Style pizza that really lives up to being a \"Pizza Pie\".\n\nThey do offer other food, such as pasta, but I've never wanted to get anything but their pizza.",

   "Came here for the happy hour and was not disappointed. We had a beer and dozen dumplings. The beer was Alaskan Amber, so they don\u2019t skimp on the promo. The dumplings we had were the Buffalo and Classic. They were both delicious with tons of flavor. The dumpling dough is thicker than other dumplings, but that wasn\u2019t an issue. The sauces/broths were amazing, but we wish there was more bread served to soak it up! \n\nOverall, this is a great stop in downtown Oly that deserves your business. The gentleman who took our order was super nice and very attentive. He was the cook, cashier, and I\u2019m sure everything else. Kudos to him!",
   "Took my daughter for dinner. The menu looks big on the board but it's really not. I like the simplicity. They could have a few more side choices. Didn't get one this time. We ordered the 18 dumpling option. The cook/one man show let me split it so we got two choices of filling. Daughter picked cheese and potato and I picked pork and beef. We both picked the loaded option for our toppings. I tried a couple dipping sauces. The garlic was too bitter (I love garlic). The Sriracha dip was better. Very filling for a great price. Seating is limited to about six or eight tables. Some are for two people. I'll go back.",
   "-Okay first off, so delicious. Everything. Every combination, everything. Yum yum! \n-Second, they'll mix and match fillings for you. It's like a surprise with every bite. Woohoo!!! \n-Third, such good service! The guy behind the counter is so polite, brings you food and drinks, and really appears to care about your experience. And his accent was beautiful.\n-Last but not least - the upstairs is delightfully warm and cozily lit. Which is fantastic in winter when you want to melt into a chair with your bowl of warm and cozy dumplings. \nEAT HERE!!!!",
   "This place was amazing! Such a cute and cozy place for starters. The food was also really, really good. Good portions for the price and the dumplings were tender and flavorful. I had the loaded chicken dumplings and it had just the right amount of sweet and savory. Definitely one of my favorite spots to go to now!",
   "This place is incredible! First, the owner is so kind and warm. Second, we ordered two rounds of food because it was so heavenly. We ended up getting the classic dumplings with pork and beef, the buffalo with chicken, and the Alaskan as a mix of everything. This is the perfect local spot to have an incredible experience!"

So many gluten free choices like swapping their gravy with  cheese sauce on top of your mash potatoes and Mac and cheese!! Thank you Way side for making vegan gluten free available and deliciously fantastic!",
   "Fantastic tasting food, and i can't wait to go back to try more. I got the rib plate and all the sides were great. They were out of the mashed potatoes so i did the house slaw instead.  It was rather noisy from a fan but other than that it was a good experience, and it was very comforting not having to ask to make changes to the menu just to keep it plant based/vegan.",
   "Yum! Tried the rib plate, and it was delicious, and worth the wait. The portion size was good because I was pretty full after eating. I'm not vegan myself, but I like trying vegan dishes when I feel like it. Of course I wasn't expecting the texture to be the same as a real rib, but it was yummy nonetheless. I'd say maybe more salt in the mac n cheese, but perhaps I just like salt too much. Lol. I'll be back for the sweets and \"wings\".",

And If that\u2019s their medium, I\u2019d hate to see a small. Never again",

The pida bread that was served with my tomato basil soup was delicious.    I will definitely be coming to try their giant pizzas.   Our calzone was to die for.    Great job guys.

Has good music playing in the background but not so loud that you and everyone else in the restaurant have to talk extra loud to carry on a conversation with each other. Had the fish and chips.  The fish was crispy and well done.  The fries were good but nothing to write home about.  The coleslaw was a bit on the warm side on being served and wasn't very flavorful.  It was warm enough I was dubious about eating it so after a couple bites I figured better safe than sorry so didn't eat it.  Overall all was good and would certainly go again.",

We literally almost walked out because of her attitude. I understand it was Sunday and they were busy. We did have a reservation and we were sat 30 minutes after our reservation time. Still no big deal but the way she interacted with not only us, but everyone else was uncalled for. I even smiled at her twice. She literally rolled her eyes lol. Obviously she doesn't know how to manage a floor or reservations and shouldn't be working with people. My family had another reservation for 2 weeks from today and we've just cancelled it. The bathroom smells horrible too.",

   "Our favorite sushi place in Olympia. Every time we go we are served quickly. They have our favorite rolls and have good service. They are usually busy however and the restaurant is small. Not a good place for large groups but they'll make up a table for you.",
   "Very friendly wait staff and high quality sushi. I absolutely love the wide variety of sushi that they offer. They have a very detailed menu so that those who are new to sushi understand what they are ordering. They always offer a cup of miso soup while you are waiting for your meal. The sushi is always fresh and beautifully placed with wasabi and ginger on the side for flavor. If you want the full experience I would highly recommend ordering the chefs choice. It's a surprise variety. These pictures were also taken after I had traded my friend two of our sushi pieces so it doesnt look as pretty as it did when I first received the plate. If you love sushi or are new to sushi I definitely recommend coming here for an all around delightful meal. They also offer a wide variety of non sushi cuisine. I have had several other non sushi dishes there and am constantly pleased with the quality of the food. Definitely recommend 100%.",
   "Very good. Surprisingly good. I came in for lunch and MAN it was good. Service was FANTASTIC. I will definitely be back and i am definitely recommending this place!!!",
   "Kenny is the champion of sushi in Olympia.  All you need to know:  he takes fresh albacore, soaks it in a garlic/black pepper marinade of his own creation, and then casually places it on the menu for true sushi aficionados to spot.  You will not find this type of attention paid to most fish, let alone sushi on the west coast.  And yet a diamond in the rough awaits you at Koibito.",

   "Best New York style pizza in the county. Fold in half,start from the point. Always friendly staff,always clean. Perfect chewy crust, wide variety of toppings, great selection for slices to go. Order in with a pint,good IPA choice too. This place earned the 5 star.",
   "Nice place. They have whole pizzas and also pizza by the slice. Been here a few times and the staff is always friendly and the pizza is always good. They have some beer on tap, as well as crater lake root beer. Also like that there is a coffee to sit either inside or outside. The pizza is this crust and the slices are big, so if you have kids, you'll have to cut them smaller. Overall it's always a good place to eat.",
   "Really good pizza. It's a small little place, but usually pretty quiet, you order your pizza at the counter and they bring it to you. You get your own drinks. A pretty classic pizza place with delicious pizza.",
   "Easily the best all around pizza place in Olympia.  I have introduced many people to Vic's and once they try it they are hooked.  Don't sleep on the Vegan slices, meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans all can agree that the vegan pizzas hold their own.  Fantastic flavors and creativity.",
   "Remember the pizza you used to eat, that was so amazing????\nVic's still makes it!!\nPlus you can buy a slice, and they always have some great vegan pizza slices.  It's informal dining , and it can be noisy at lunch or dinner time,  but it's a true neighborhood hangout,  and if the locals love it,  you might, too....."

Even the bamboo shoots are something special! The squid was the bomb too! Will definitely be coming back. I read about the service being crappy, bull!! they were ALL sweet as can be! Even the chefs."

That goo sauce reminds me of deviled eggs and kind of tastes like it too. The fries are like the ones you got as a kid for school lunch (not good) my husband got a chocolate shake it wasn\u2019t stirred well they just pour chocolate syrup in, I got a banana milk shake it was not good. I would not go back. The lady at the burger stand was way more personable than the ladies who work at the main house or pay area where we got the milkshakes",
   "It had been over 30 years since I had a Big Tom's Burger. I'm thinking the last time was with my daddy, when I lived near there in 1981, before moving to Seattle. Now, I'm back in town, hit up Big Tom's and they make a great burger. If you're looking for just a simple but satisfying burger, minus all the extra mess, then Big Tom's is the place. Friendly staff, ready to assist you, and great strawberry shakes.",
   "The double burger was pretty good. The parking lot was insane though. Cars everywhere. The staff was really friendly. Might try eating here again when they are serving off their regular menu.",
   "Big Tom's is an Olympia original. I arrived during a peak rush about 6pm. There was a line backing up onto the street. My eyes instantly met the eyes of an employee directing me out of the line and to a parking area. The service was prompt, friendly and attentive. I didn't even wait long- even with the line. I saw employees scurrying about. All were engaged with customers. The Big Tom, tots, goop and milkshake were all yummy and live up to the reputation! Service and food both get thumbs up! Its a great drive through and worth your visit!",

Nice and friendly atmosphere and our waiter was great. They also do a punch card here so that is a major bonus. You buy a meal and get a stamp fill up the card and get a free meal.",
   "I love Danang. They have a full and unique menu. The biggest thing I appreciate about danang is there vegan and vegetarian options if you are looking for meatless.  Service is not overly attentive but always correct.  They have delicious hum bow and the yellow seafood curry is amazing!",
   "I used to be a huge fan. Lately, I've ordered delivery from this restaurant. I recently made a comment to my partner that Da Nang seems to be messing up our orders more frequently than not.\n\nOn the last few occasions, I ordered vegetarian \"almond chicken,\" which comes with deep friend imitation chicken and a sort of almond sauce to drizzle over the almond crumbles.\n\nThe sauce they've delivered is clearly old, as if they've made it earlier in the week and kept it refrigerated. However, the sauce is beyond edible and has separated into a sort of hard lump of almond and smelly old oil.  On top of receiving old, curdled almond sauce, I've received congealed peanut sauce for the spring rolls. I have a feeling they are not cleaning out their refrigerator as frequently as they should.\n\nIn addition to the gross sauces, the new delivery guy seems to chain smoke with the windows up in his car while delivering the food, leaving the food and packaging with a very strong stench of cigarette smoke.\n\nI'm not someone to leave bad reviews. I've given them at least 5 chances. Unfortunately, I no longer have an appetite for Da Nang. Dine-in if you eat here, so you can see the food before paying.",
   "The restaurant itself was clean and had a calming, peaceful atmosphere. The food was amazing. Since moving back to Olympia from the Seattle area two years ago, we've been looking for a great bowl of pho...found it. The spring roll was so delicious to the point my daughter tried it and loved it. This a must visit.",

   "I got the chicken fried steak and my husband got the cornbread hash and our daughter got the pancakes. We waited an hour to be seated at 11, the chicken fried steak tasted funny not like in the south, the cornbread was like cake, the server was nice but not attentive there were people waiting standing up watching us which is awkward. The cornbread and pink butter was good, toast was good, eggs were good. It was $50 for breakfast which seemed extremely expensive",
   "AMAZING!!! Every item on the menu is fresh and delicious! The service is wonderful, very sweet and caring people! It's also family friendly. We love it there. It's our go-to breakfast restaurant after mass every Sunday!",
   "For the price, and the wait, should've gone somewhere else. The place has good food. I ordered the corned beef hash. The potatoes and hash browns were good. I even enjoyed the eggs, and the sour dough bread was amazing. The corn bread was too sweet for me, reminding me more of yellow cake. My 6 year old loved it, and kept calling the spread that came with it \"frosting\". Like I said, the place is good, but it took an hour to even sit. It's better than IHOP, but I was just done with the whole experience by the time I got seated.",
   "Excellent everything! The food is amazing! The staff is friendly and fast!  The ambiance is welcoming and earthy. Even the other patrons were friendly and talkative!  \nIf you like pancakes,  you have to order the monstrous blueberry and pistachio...OMG! \nAll around nice place to eat and enjoy a great meal. The price is a bit spendy but definitely worth it! My husband and I had breakfast \"a whole lot to eat\" for about 50.00"

The decor, the tables, the back of the bar, and even a round table around a fire!? I was hands down impressed when I compared this location to the old El Sarape! \nThe food was also great, we ordered 2 different taco plates and both were good! The avocado salsa that came with them was just right and delicious! The drinks were also good and fast (we were in the bar but that doesn't always equal good or fast). Lastly we fed 2 adults with margaritas for less than $50! \nIf you didn't like the old place, make sure you gice this one a shot, you won't be dissappointed!",

   "Always good food, fresh and delicious. Brews to choose from Leavenworth to their own home variety, plenty of seating, located in downtown Olympia.",
   "It was packed! Which I like to see means that it\u2019s a good place to eat. Had the Fish tacos and sweet potato fries. It was delicious, we ordered food and it was out in no time! Great service and Fantastic Food. Definitely a must go!",
   "I liked this place and think that they had a good selection! I tried a couple of the IPAs and was not disappointed!!! The staff were very nice, friendly, and helpful in selecting beers, the food was good as well! We had the public house  burger and they cooked it to order! We also had the tater tots which were impressive from someone coming from the Midwest! The place was fairly spacious, with indoor and outdoor seating and a pretty sizable indoor area. This place had good ambiance and overall great place to stop for a beer and food!!",
   "Great selection of beer from a classic WA brewpub.  I enjoyed each of my 4 samples.  The imperial IPA with honey notes (Hodgson\u2019s Imperial IPA) was the standout for me.  Their nachos were excellent with plenty to go around for a group.  The venue is huge but in need of some interior investment.  Super nice and attentive staff!",
   "Delicious!! The fish basket is enormous. Perfectly fried cod and oysters. Plenty of beer and cider on tap to choose from. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is inviting!"

   "I was in Olympia for a night and we decided to get some burgers at this place. The service was phenomenal! I wish I remembered ladies that attended us there, because they were incredibly nice! The food itself left me satisfied and reminded me of what a good quality burger should taste like. The burger itself was super juicy (I got the 'Juicy Lucy' so it lived up to its name). Overall, my experience here was great and if I find myself in Olympia again, this will be the first place I visit!",
   "I've been several times and always enjoyed the meals. Menu has something for most diners. It's largely pub fair done well, burgers, fish and chips, salads, etc... Everything I've tried was good.\nLooked like 8-12 taps and a variety of styles of beer as well as a full bar.\nIt's a small spot so there may be a wait during busy hours. There is some outside seating as weather permits.",
   "Don't wait, stop in. Street parking may be tough at busy times. Fast friendly service, clean and efficient.  I only had fish and chips -excellent light and crispy beer batter and thin cut fries, coleslaw was very good also. There is a nice selection of brews and wine. The restroom was very clean. I will be back for more.",
   "Absolutely L.O.V.E.  this place!  Limited parking, so take advantage of the easy access by bike.   Best tomato bisque in Oly.",
   "Great food as usual although I would desire another choice of potatoes for breakfast other than tots or fries and a better choice of toast.  For lunch or dinner no one beats S&C but they need to make the same commitment to breakfast that they do to dinner.  The omelette was awesome, my partner's bacon looked amazing, good coffee, just need to step up their game with home fries and toast."

   "This is Bryan. I wanted to write this review and give credit due where it's due. I haven't been here to this place in 3 years. I'm temporarily here for a month and wanted to stop in and have a few beers. There is a Barkeep here named John. He is what makes this Bar. It's a decent place to go if you want to just chill lay back and get your thoughts together. You won't meet a more real good hearted good guy than John. The folks here are awesome and they have great food etc.\n  We need to as Americans support our good little American bars and Cafes. Thumbs up to The Reef.

They were so gracious and gave me a stamp card for free crispy egg rolls on my 6th order. The chicken pad Thai was a sufficient spicy at a level two, came with fresh carrots, sprouts, and crushed peanuts! Will definitely be back.",

The salad rolls were fresh and they came with two delicious sauces to dip them in. Our main courses were fresh and steaming hot in our togo boxes. At home we feasted and decided that Narai is the only place to get Thai in Oly.",

When I was served I had to really look around for the 2-medium size Oysters. I was expecting a dish that was focused on oysters, more than 2 anyway. That was very disappointing to me. Don't put the word oysters in the description and serve a dish with 2 Oysters! The dish fell short \u2639\ufe0f due to the lack of them, in my option."

It's menu while small still has something of value for everyone. I can honestly say they have the best and I mean THE BEST buttermilk pancakes EVER! Lunch is great too! I also love their sustainability focus, by locally sourcing, composting, and utilizing paper straws. Let's not forget the staff who work hard to provide you with a fabulous experience, quick service, suggestions, and a kind smile.",
   "The atmosphere is nice enough but the food was a bit off. I had the bacon, egg, pub potatoes and pancakes with a Dr. Pepper. The bacon was okay. Egg, scrambled was a bit tasteless. The potatoes tasted like they should have been tossed out due to being past their prime. The pancakes, although smelled wonderful, reminded me more of a custard or flan. They just didn\u2019t taste like good ole hot cakes. Everything just seemed lacking in flavor",
   "Excellent bar food and fast service.  I went\nwith a group at happy hour and the menu choices was very good.  So was the\nprice, if you go try the fried pickles and\nwings.  If you just want to eat good fried food, at a quiet no nonsense restaurant, this is a great place for you.",
   "Innocuous interior with no \"public house\" feel. Food was adequate,  and I would go again to try other menu items. I had a skillet breakfast and it was decent but lacked pizzazz. \"Toast\" was not buttered and was little more than dried bread with no color or toasting on it.\nWait staff was friendly and efficient. \nDefinitely worth a try, could be a good place, just need to dial it in a bit on what they're trying to be with food and atmosphere.",
   "Good food in a laid back atmosphere. Wait staff has always been friendly and our orders have been accurate. Service times can be a bit slow so leave yourself some time to relax and enjoy :)"

Food is fresh, lots of veggies and it doesn't take very long.  Staff is friendly too, good ambiance with the plants in the room.",
   "The food tasted like it was made days ago and just reheated. The server was asked for lemon when she did our drink order and we never received them till asking when she finally checked on us half way through the meal. The rice dishes were extremely dry and even with lots of soy sauce, still taste less. Sadly I will not eat here again!!!",
   "What a wonderful ambience. The service was fast, the food was delicious. We can their hot wings and spicy fried dumplings for an appetizer. Followed by a vegetarian and non vegetarian entree. Both were delicious and served with a side of rice. Definitely worth the $12.50 we paid for them. The Thai iced coffees were delicious as well. The fish tank was cool for the kids too look at during the short wait for our food. All the plants were nice to look at as well. I highly recommend going in just after noon. Very chill.",
   "This is a top notch eating establishment. With authentic Thai food and drink.  Prices are moderate but not overly expensive. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly and Everything tasted wonderful.  Enjoy",
   "I have worked in the restaurant industry for many years. I had been to Thai garden multiple times but today I had a bad experience... it was little things that added up that I usually let slide because I am a server myself. But this time I really felt like they don\u2019t know about good customer service policies:\n1.) we walked in and weren\u2019t greeted...there were 2 tables and no employees in the front of the house to be found, meanwhile 2 other tables came in. Finally we got sat.\n\n2.) I love to try new food and decided to try a new dish. I got 3/4 stars on spicy. My curry was just not good... I didn\u2019t like it (it was flavorless, needed salt and seasoning, it wasn\u2019t spicy AT ALL) I couldn\u2019t keep eating it. I never send anything back but I had to let the server know. \nI told her I didn\u2019t like the dish... \nto my surprised she responded that \u201cit your decision to order that dish, and our policy is that we can\u2019t take something off a bill because you simply didn\u2019t like it\u201d she left and came back and then let me know that she could give me a free spring roll but couldn\u2019t take my food that I didn\u2019t eat or like off the bill. \n\n3.) never seen a complaint handled this way in the service industry, it might not have been the servers fault but whoever implemented their policies needs to know they are going to lose customers if the customers concerns aren\u2019t taken seriously."

Great selection of wine, great atmosphere. If you need to get a good steak in the area, look no further",

   "Had the buffet and it was decent but for me,   not something I'd repeat too soon. The meat was pretty dry and the samosa on the buffet was stuffed with rice and corn instead of the usual patatos,  peas,  etc.. so these two things really tainted my experience. Another fried item seemed stale - as if it sat on the buffet line too long.   Perhaps I caught them on an off day but I wasn't too pleased with that. The server was very nice and attentive with water and removing used dishes.  I just wanted the food to be better.",
   "This is a family run restaurant, I had great Service and the food was very delicious. I got the \"spicy\" chicken Marsala which was hot for sure but had a great blend of flavors. Pair it with a beer and your good to go.",
   "It was very good experience for us when we ate there. We were traveling from Portland to Seattle. We wanted to get some Indian food and this place was awesome! Customer service was good. We don\u2019t have anything to complain! Several people asked us about the food in the restaurant. It was very easy to find perking since it was weekend. We ordered non vegetarian deal. It was plenty for both of us. I think three people can eat easily."

   "Possibly the best food in Olympia. Limited hours and at the Farmers Market. \nSo many ways to enjoy local oysters, and all made fresh on site.",
   "I am a little suprised that the reviews are so good for this eatery.   It is not bad by any means, but in an area with tons of fresh good seafood, it also is not the top of the list either.  What this place does have is a good location.  As part of our outdoor Farmer's Market in the area, it is a hot food option while visiting the market.  I ordered the prawn basket and it was just ok.  If I were to return again I think I would try the crab cakes.  Just a so so place.",
   "Excellent menu of northwest seafood delight with friendly staff serving behind the counter. Crab Cakes Benedict is delicious!",
   "Pretty good choice if a little appetite plagues you. Great selection of fresh fish and seafood meals.",
   "Dingey\u2019s has the best clam chowder in the world and there fish and chips are incredible."

We were able to enjoy our friend and the food and not be interfered with for a long dinner.  We felt welcome and not out of place as some restaurants go if they can't turn the table over several times a night. I cannot wait to go back to continue going through their menu.",
   "Swing Wine Bar is a cute, upscale yet homey feel, restaurant that overlooks the beautiful lake. The food is always devine, with well thought out menus. As a non drinker, they had crafty moktails, which were perfect! Large craft cocktail menu, with a great wine list as well! Perfect for any occasion, as they have outside AND inside seating. It's PERFECT FOR DATE NIGHTS.",
   "Love getting dinner here. Fantastic location to bring a date or meet friends for dinner and drinks! Meals are exceptional!",
   "Been here a couple times and have always had a great experience.  The ambiance is great - and old house overlooking Capital Lake converted into a wine bar restaurant.  Service is very attentive and friendly.  They have a happy hour menu called the Lush Rush that changes, not sure how often, but the drinks and food options change.   This visit was a happy hour visit with my mom and we both had a Five O'clock Somewhere drink, and the Bacon wrapped dates for a little bite to eat.   Both yummy!   Will continue to visit this little house on the hill!",
   "Delicious food, must try the gorgonzola mushrooms, deviled eggs, street tacos were amazing. The baked brie is delicious as well. Huge menu of custom crafted cocktails and wine. You can also enjoy wine flights and whisky flights. The view is amazing, great service and atmosphere. Highly recommend."

The waitress took forever to greet us. She was the only person I saw all night and she said it was her first night.",
   "I'd give 6 stars if I could. Amazing food, outstanding service, beautiful venue, endless menu, this place was amazing. My friends/family from out of town demanded TO-GO boxes, & continued to talk about the food for hours afterward. Highly recommended!",
   "We enjoyed a very yummy breakfast on Friday. I had the goat cheese & spinach scramble w/fruit & toast: FANTASTIC, delicious & not the typical boring & unripe fruit: a Wonderful, generous assemblage of delicious assorted fruit. My friends & I Will return!!",
   "Got brunch and it was great! Chicken Fried Steak, a poached eggs, a biscuit, and grits! All flavorful and delicious! A decent Bloody Mary too.",
   "Great breakfast spot, and has a cool lounge for cocktails in the evening with a decent dinner menu. Service was fast and professional."

   "Delicious food and drinks!! Love visiting peppers for the mole, but tried their crema sauce last night and wow was it good. They also deliver!",
   "This was our first time at Peppers.  We stopped here for lunch.  The restaurant was nice and clean.  We ordered a chimichanga and fajitas.   The portions were large.  The food was great.",
   "Although the food is generally pretty good, I am VERY concerned that several times I have received salsa that is so old that it is bubbling and fermenting. \n\nI hope that someone that works here is monitoring the feedback from customers - I order online often as I live close by, and feel I should be reimbursed fairly for at least two occasions I paid $4.99 for chips and salsa and gotten old batches. Also, I've gotten stale chips almost always. As an aside - if I were ordering in the restaurant, I wouldn't have to pay for chips and salsa at all, as its included in any Mexican restaurant. \n\nIn general, these  mistake makes me worried that other things are also being overlooked, and I honestly want to keep being a customer... getting a little closer to not, though."

The restaurant is right along the falls and the view on a stormy night was incredible. This is my first night during a stay in Olympia and it was a wonderful way to start it!",

   "This place has the most authentic Mexican food in town. The flavors are over the top! Great menu and very good table service. Chances are that the owner will stop by your table to ensure all is well.\nThe prices are moderate.\nGenerous servings for every plate I saw. A good selection of draft beers and a full bar.\nThis place is easy to find, access, and exit. It is fully handicapped accessable.\nIf you found this review to be helpful please consider adding a thumbs-up.",
   "Had a wonderful dinner with my large group of friends - they accommodated us without issue and also got our entire order correct!  Delicious food with a spicy Latin twist. Self serve chips and salsa bar was fun and unique also! Happy hour menu and signature margarita- yummy! Definitely a great place and will come again!",
   "I really enjoy this restaurant.  The owner is very friendly and the staff is nice.  I've been there a few times and the food is always delicious. I especially appreciate their salsa and salad bar. They also have a good selection of drinks.  I am always happy and satisfied with my visits.  I will definitely be returning. Thank you.",
   "The food was fabulous and the prices were reasonable.  My group included a vegetarian who said the vegetarian/vegan menu was one of the most extensive in town. The serving sizes were immense, and the staff will bring to-go containers without being asked. There is both a salad bar and a chips and salsa bar that are complimentary. We were served by the owner, who was friendly, courteous, and patient with all our questions. I seldom leave reviews, but this place rocks -- try it!",
   "nice place to go have a dinner,They have many options in Draft beer  And the menu they have so much options  And  Now they have vegetarian menu, Is very family oriented you can bring your kids.\n When I go to the restaurant I really want a cold beer and a good dinner and he called outings they have bought them I recommend this place to come over and try it."

Wanted to hand it off to someone else even though it wasn't door dashes fault our order was wrong and very cold.  The food where in plastic containers that had so much  condensation in them everything was soggy and wet. \nWe just wanted to help the local businesses out in this time of need and enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast, but instead my husband spent his morning trying to get our order fixed and the kids ate cereal  \n next time I'll make our own breakfast",

   "The restaurant decor and condition of the furniture is better than other IHOPs restaurants in the area.  I ordered the Colorado Omelette, but it did not look near as appetizing as the picture on the menu. I'll try to order something different next time. I also had the side of fruit, 3 of 3 of the grapes in were not fresh. Learn from me, order something.  \ud83d\ude09",

   "Amazing sushi place! The staff is very polite, and my waiter even helped me decide what do order. Not only does it look beautiful, but tastes phenomenal. But, it does take some time for them to make it, so probably don't eat here if you have limited time.",
   "My new favorite restaurant! Super tasty sushi and a great atmosphere for a really reasonable price! \nYou can get a full plate of 7 to 10 pieces of delicious sushi for $10-15 \u2014 Fresh crab, tuna, shrimp, octopus, etc... \nReally, with how expensive seafood normally is at other restaurants, it amazing what you get. It's not a HUGE amount of food, but it's surprisingly filling and, more importantly, you feel great after eating! It has a refreshing and revitalizing aftereffect that you definitely don't get after eating a burger and fries at Red Robin.",
   "I have avoided sushi my whole life. This is great. They have so many different rolls. One fills me up pretty well. My favorite is the Ichi Roll- tempura shrimp, avocado, cooked shrimp on top, cucumber & a sweet sesame dressing. It's in a strip mall, but the interior makes you feel like you are in a nice restaurant. Now I crave it every week. They also have American food as well as lots of other cooked dishes to try if raw isn't your thing.",
   "Second or possibly third best sushi bar in Olympia after Sushi house and followed by Koibito which is only slightly behind. But still insanely good. Any of the top 3 would not be a wasted outing in the least.",
   "I used to go here all the time before the virus and  Service is top notch and the food is amazing. The inside is beautiful and the lighting is calm."
